       - Evidence was sufficient for a reasonable fact-finder to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the offense of riot in a penal institution because the state introduced evidence of the defendant's legal confinement, and the state's evidence regarding the prisoners housed at the county jail would have been sufficient for the jury to conclude that the jail constituted a penal institution within the meaning of O.C.G.A.

     <p>
      If any inmate of any state or county correctional institution, county or municipal jail, or other similar facility, while such inmate is in custody or in the process of being taken into custody, injures or has injured or contacts or has contacted a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, firefighter, emergency medical technician, or other person in such a manner as to present a possible threat of transmission of a communicable disease to the person so injured or contacted, then the warden, jailer, or other official having charge of such inmate may take all reasonable steps to determine whether the inmate has a communicable disease capable of being transmitted by the injury or contact involved. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, any appropriate medical examination of or collection of medical specimens from the inmate. In the event an inmate refuses to cooperate in any such procedures, the warden, jailer, or other official may apply to the superior court of the county for an order authorizing the use of any degree of force reasonably necessary to complete such procedures. Upon a showing of probable cause that the injury presents the threat of transmission of a communicable disease, the court shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to use reasonable measures to perform any medical procedures reasonably necessary to ascertain whether a communicable disease has been transmitted. In addition to any other grounds sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of such an order, such probable cause may be conclusively established by evidence of the injury or contact in question and a statement by a licensed physician that the nature of the injury or contact is such as to present a threat of transmission of a communicable disease if the inmate has such a disease. The cost of any procedures carried out under this Code section shall be borne by the jurisdiction having custody of the inmate.

It is further the intent of this legislative body to reduce the costs and expenses of operating state prisons by reducing the number of alien prisoners incarcerated in the Georgia penal system and to expedite the deportation process of such prisoners. Moreover, Georgia should support the rearrest and revocation of parole of any alien prisoner who reenters the United States in violation of a release on a reprieve with a detainer to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

   §
   24/HB 1059, designated existing Code Sections 42-1-12 and 42-1-13 and new Code Sections 42-1-14 and 42-1-15 as Article 2 of this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ga. L. 2006, p. 379,
   §
   1/HB 1059, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds and declares that recidivist sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Many sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and some sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The General Assembly finds that this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. The General Assembly further finds that the high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Incarcerating sexual offenders and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Requiring the registration of sexual offenders, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Collecting data relative to sexual offenses and sexual offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Requiring sexual predators who are released into the community to wear an electronic monitoring system for the rest of their natural life and to pay for such system; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The General Assembly further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual offenders and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual offenders to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual offenders. The General Assembly declares that in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual offenders be registered and that members of the community and the public be notified of a sexual offender's presence. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes. Likewise, the designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from findings by the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board and a court if requested by a sexual offender."

   1-2/SB 8, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "(a) The General Assembly finds that arresting, prosecuting, and incarcerating victimized children serves to retraumatize children and increases their feelings of low self esteem, making the process of recovery more difficult.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that both federal and state laws recognize that sexually exploited children are the victims of crime and should be treated as victims.
   The General Assembly finds that sexually exploited children deserve the protection of child welfare services, including family support, crisis intervention, counseling, and emergency housing services.
   The General Assembly finds that it is necessary and appropriate to adopt uniform and reasonable assessments and regulations to help address the deleterious secondary effects, including but not limited to, prostitution and sexual exploitation of children, associated with adult entertainment establishments that allow the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol on premises and that provide to their patrons performances and interaction involving various forms of nudity.
   The General Assembly finds that a correlation exists between adult live entertainment establishments and the sexual exploitation of children.
   The General Assembly finds that adult live entertainment establishments present a point of access for children to come into contact with individuals seeking to sexually exploit children.
   The General Assembly further finds that individuals seeking to exploit children utilize adult live entertainment establishments as a means of locating children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that many local governments in this state and in other states found deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments are exacerbated by the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol in such establishments.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The purpose of this Act is to protect a child from further victimization after he or she is discovered to be a sexually exploited child by ensuring that a child protective response is in place in this state.
   The purpose and intended effect of this Act in imposing assessments and regulations on adult entertainment establishments is not to impose a restriction on the content or reasonable access to any materials or performances protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, Section I, Paragraph V of the Constitution of this state."

       Because sexual offender registry requirements are regulatory, and not punitive the registry requirement is not a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; moreover, it is of no consequence whether a defendant has committed an offense that is "sexual" in nature before being required to register since the nature of the offense requiring the registration would not somehow change the registration requirements into a form of "punishment."

       - Trial court's conclusion that the state failed to present any competent evidence showing that the defendant had changed residences was erroneous because in the court's assessment of the evidence, the trial court erroneously determined that an investigator's testimony amounted to inadmissible hearsay; the investigator's testimony as to the declaration of the defendant's father that the defendant no longer lived at that residence was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement and was admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. Moreover, the circumstances presented by the evidence would authorize a rational trier of fact to find that the defendant had intended to change residences without notifying the local authorities as required; the evidence showed that the defendant had been living at the defendant's mother's residence for over two weeks, had not returned to the defendant's father's residence by the time the defendant was arrested, had failed to report for a scheduled meeting with a probation officer, and had not contacted the probation officer to explain the defendant's failure to report for the meeting or to provide any information as to the defendant's current residential status.

       - Trial court erred when the court denied the defendant's petition for release from the requirement to register as a sex offender and failed to determine whether the defendant ever touched a woman who testified at the criminal trial without the woman's consent, thereby committing a sexual offense; thus, since neither the verdict nor the evidentiary ruling in the defendant's case conclusively established that the encounter was a "relevant similar transaction," further proceedings were necessary. Yelverton v. State of Georgia, <cite class="ga_court">300 Ga. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">794 S.E.2d 613</cite> (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court was indeed authorized, after denying the petition to be released from the sex offender registration requirement on one specific ground and being reversed on appeal, to deny the petition a second time for a wholly different reason. Royster v. State of Ga., <cite class="ga_app_court">346 Ga. App. 333</cite>, <cite class="app_court">814 S.E.2d 455</cite> (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's request to be released from the sex offender registration requirements as the record showed that the defendant was convicted of an intentional act of aggravated child molestation which resulted in physical injury to the victim when the defendant placed the defendant's finger inside the rectum of a child under the age of 14 years, with the intent to satisfy the sexual desires of the accused, and which resulted in physical injury to the child. Strickland v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">347 Ga. App. 216</cite>, <cite class="app_court">818 S.E.2d 675</cite> (2018).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c01s42-1-19" target="_self">42-1-19</a></cite> barred a person on the sex offender registry from filing a second petition for release from registration requirements within two years from a final order on a previous petition, if the first petition for relief was denied, but the defendant's first petition was not denied as the petition was treated as either a voluntary dismissal or, alternatively, a dismissal for failure to prosecute, neither of which operated as an adjudication on the merits of the first petition, the trial court erred by dismissing the defendant's second petition for release from sex offender registration requirements as that petition was not filed within two years of the previous petition.

       - Warden of a public works camp (now county correctional institution) will not be held liable for torts of convicts on mere averment that the warden was negligent "in permitting said convicts to roam the roads of this county and state in a truck, without any guard," whereby injuries resulted from a collision of the truck with the plaintiff's car as it was discretionary with the warden to determine how and in what manner convicts employed outside the confines of the camp (now county correctional institution) doing work in connection with its operation should be suffered to go at large, and wardens acting in a discretionary capacity will not be liable unless guilty of willfulness, fraud, malice, or corruption, or unless the warden knowingly act wrongfully, and not according to the warden's honest convictions of duty. Price v. Owen, <cite class="ga_app_court">67 Ga. App. 58</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 529</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

      The Governor, upon certification by the commissioner of corrections and approval by the director of the Office of Planning and Budget that the population of the prison system of the State of Georgia has exceeded the capacity of the prison system for any period of 90 consecutive days, beginning at any time after December 31, 1988, may declare a state of emergency with regard to jail and prison overcrowding. Following the declaration of such emergency, the department may establish additional facilities for use by the department, such facilities to be either of a permanent type of construction or of a temporary or movable type as the department may find most advantageous to the particular needs, to the end that the inmates under its supervision may be so distributed throughout the state as to facilitate individualization of treatment designed to prepare them for lawful living in the community where they are most likely to reside after their release from a correctional facility. For this purpose, the department may purchase or lease sites and suitable lands and erect necessary buildings thereon or purchase or lease existing facilities, all within the limits of appropriations as approved by the General Assembly. With the approval of the Governor, provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 50, relating to the Department of Administrative Services, or provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 or Chapter 22 of Title 50, relating to control over acquisition of professional services, may be waived by the department to facilitate the rapid construction or procurement of facilities for inmates; provided, however, that the authority to waive provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 shall terminate as of July 1, 1991. During any year in which correctional facilities are constructed or procured under this Code section and any requirements are waived, the department shall furnish the Governor and the General Assembly with a detailed report specifying the facilities constructed or procured, the requirements waived, and the reasons therefor.

      The court in which a person is charged with a felony for which bond is permissible under the law may, upon the application by the person so charged, at its discretion release the person prior to conviction and upon recognizance to the supervision of a pretrial release or diversion program established and operated by DCS after an investigation and upon recommendation of the staff of the pretrial release or diversion program.

     <p>
      A county shall be authorized to establish a diversion center under the direction of the sheriff of the county in which the diversion center is located and a diversion program for the confinement of certain individuals who have been found in contempt of court for violation of orders granting temporary or permanent alimony or child support and sentenced pursuant to subsection (c) of Code Section 15-1-4. While in such diversion program, the respondent shall be authorized to travel to and from his or her place of employment and to continue his or her occupation. The official in charge of the diversion program or his or her designee shall prescribe the routes, manner of travel, and periods of travel to be used by the respondent in attending to his or her occupation. If the respondent's occupation requires the respondent to travel away from his or her place of employment, the amount and conditions of such travel shall be approved by the official in charge of the diversion center or his or her designee. When the respondent is not traveling to or from his or her place of employment or engaging in his or her occupation, such respondent shall be confined in the diversion center during the term of the sentence. With the approval of the sheriff or his or her designee, the respondent may participate in educational or counseling programs offered at the diversion center. While participating in the diversion program, such respondent shall be liable for alimony or child support as previously ordered, including arrears, and his or her income shall be subject to the provisions of Code Sections 19-6-30 through 19-6-33.1 and Chapter 11 of Title 19. In addition, should any funds remain after payment of child support or alimony, such respondent may be charged a fee payable to the county operating the diversion program to cover the costs of his or her incarceration and the administration of the diversion program which fee shall be not more than $30.00 per day or the actual per diem cost of maintaining the respondent, whichever is less, for the entire period of time such respondent is confined to the diversion center and participating in the diversion program. If such respondent fails to comply with any of the requirements imposed upon him or her in accordance with this Code section, nothing shall prevent the sentencing judge from revoking such assignment to such diversion program and providing for alternative methods of incarceration.

     <p>
    - While it is beyond dispute that the sheriff, and not the superior court, is charged with administration of jails, when an issue is properly raised before the trial court regarding jail security or other matters of jail administration and evidence is presented on the issue, the court is empowered to make a determination. Upon a determination that the jail is not secure, the trial court is authorized to order the sheriff to transfer a prisoner to the nearest county having a secure jail.

       - Sheriff owes to a prisoner placed in the sheriff's custody a duty to keep the prisoner safely and free from harm, to render to the prisoner medical aid when necessary, and to treat the prisoner humanely and refrain from oppressing the prisoner; and if a sheriff is negligent in the sheriff's care and custody of a prisoner, and as a result the prisoner receives injury or meets death, or if a sheriff fails in the performance of the sheriff's duty to the prisoner, and the latter suffers injury or meets death as a result of such failure, the sheriff would, in a proper case, be liable on the sheriff's official bond, to the injured prisoner or to the prisoner's dependents.

      It shall be the duty of the grand jury, at each term of the superior court held in the county, to inquire into the contents of the record kept by the sheriff as required by Code Section 42-4-7. If the record is not kept or is incorrectly kept, the grand jury shall so report to the court. Upon the report's being made, the judge presiding shall cause the district attorney to have the sheriff served with a rule requiring him to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. The judge shall inquire into the facts and, if he finds that Code Section 42-4-7 has not been complied with, he shall impose a fine of not less than $25.00 nor more than $50.00 for the first offense and not more than $100.00 and not less than $50.00 for each subsequent offense. The fines shall be enforced and collected by attachment, as in other cases of attachments against sheriffs.

      Except as otherwise provided in this Code section, any sheriff, constable, keeper of a jail, or other officer whose duty it is to receive persons charged with or guilty of an indictable offense who refuses to receive and take charge of such a person shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00. A sheriff, constable, keeper of a jail, or other officer whose duty it is to receive persons charged with or guilty of an indictable offense shall be authorized to refuse acceptance of any person who has not received medical treatment for obvious physical injuries or conditions of an emergency nature. Upon such refusal, it shall be the responsibility of the arresting agency to take the individual to a health care facility or health care provider in order to secure a medical release. Upon medical release by the health care facility or health care provider, the sheriff, constable, or keeper of the jail must assume custody of the individual; provided, however, that in all cases the sheriff, constable, or keeper of the jail must assume custody where no health care facility is located in the county in which the arrest occurred and, in such instances, the governing authority of the arresting agency shall pay all costs related to the medical release.

   §
   13, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly recognizes that criminal street gangs have succeeded at times in maintaining their structure, organization, and discipline in penal institutions and have continued to conduct criminal activities while incarcerated. Therefore, the General Assembly requests and encourages state and local officials with responsibility for the operation of adult and juvenile penal institutions and related facilities to develop policies and procedures which will identify members of criminal street gangs and, where necessary, to separate members and associates of the same criminal street gang in order that such gang members cannot maintain the gang's structure, organization, and discipline and will have a more difficult time in conducting criminal activities while incarcerated in this state."

       Deputy sheriff in the deputy's official capacity was entitled to sovereign immunity with respect to a former inmate's claims arising from denial of a dietary request; the sheriff's powers were derived from the state, and provision of food to county jail inmates was a state function.

       - Providing adequate medical attention for inmates under the defendant's custody and control is a ministerial act by the sheriff and his or her deputies and does not involve the exercise of discretion; thus, such act is not subject to either sovereign immunity or official immunity. Cantrell v. Thurman, <cite class="ga_app_court">231 Ga. App. 510</cite>, <cite class="app_court">499 S.E.2d 416</cite> (1998).

       While subsection (a) of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c05s42-5-2" target="_self">42-5-2</a></cite> imposes the duty and the cost for medical care of inmates in the custody of a county upon the county, it does not waive sovereign immunity of the county or the county's agents and employees. Howard v. City of Columbus, <cite class="ga_app_court">239 Ga. App. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">521 S.E.2d 51</cite> (1999), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">530 U.S. 1215</cite>, <cite class="s_court">120 S. Ct. 2218</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">147 L.

       Without proof by the administrator of the decedent inmate's estate that any actions undertaken by the county officers and employees sued for wrongful death amounted to wilfulness, malice, or corruption, they were entitled to official immunity as a matter of law; further, any failure to adopt other or additional requirements as to their policies of supervision and training in dealing with a suicidal inmate did not amount to wilfulness, malice, or corruption. Middlebrooks v. Bibb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">261 Ga. App. 382</cite>, <cite class="app_court">582 S.E.2d 539</cite> (2003), overruled in part Tattnall County v.

       Trial court incorrectly denied a prison official's motion for summary judgment on the estate administrators' 42 U.S.C.
   §
   1983 claim against the official, following an inmate's death from a Tylenol overdose, because, while the official was aware that the decedent faced a substantial risk of serious harm, the administrators did not show that the official displayed deliberate indifference to the decedent's serious medical needs. Furthermore, the administrators failed to prove that the official was acting outside the scope of the person's official duties or employment; consequently, even if the official acted with malice or intent to injure the decedent, the official was immune from liability on the administrators' state law claims against the official. Minor v. Barwick, <cite class="ga_app_court">264 Ga. App. 327</cite>, <cite class="app_court">590 S.E.2d 754</cite> (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       County sheriff was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity because, under Georgia law, the sheriff was not acting as an arm of the state when caring for the medical needs of an inmate; instead, the sheriff was carrying out a statutory duty assigned to the county under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c05s42-5-2ol1a" target="_self">42-5-2(a)</a></cite>. Dukes v. State, 428 F. Supp. 2d 1298 (N.D. Ga. 2006), aff'd, 212 Fed. Appx. 916 (11th Cir. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a parent's wrongful death action, the trial court erred in denying a county's motion for summary judgment because O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c05s42-5-2" target="_self">42-5-2</a></cite> did not waive the county's sovereign immunity for claims based on failure to provide medical care; Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c05s42-5-2" target="_self">42-5-2</a></cite> does not provide an express waiver, and nothing in the statute can be read to imply a waiver. Gish v. Thomas, <cite class="ga_app_court">302 Ga. App. 854</cite>, <cite class="app_court">691 S.E.2d 900</cite> (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court correctly determined that the state law claims made against a county and against a sheriff and medical contract compliance administrator in their official capacities were barred because although O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c05s42-5-2ol1a" target="_self">42-5-2(a)</a></cite> imposed upon the county the duty and cost of medical care for inmates in the county's custody, the county did not waive sovereign immunity of the county or the county's agents or employees. Graham v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">316 Ga. App. 738</cite>, <cite class="app_court">730 S.E.2d 439</cite> (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Appellate court erred by affirming a trial court's denial of a city's motion to dismiss an inmate's complaint because the care of inmates in the custody of a municipal corporation is a governmental function for which sovereign immunity has not been waived; therefore, the inmate was precluded from pursuing negligence claims. City of Atlanta v. Mitcham, <cite class="ga_court">296 Ga. 576</cite>, <cite class="app_court">769 S.E.2d 320</cite> (2015).

       - Evidence supported convictions of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and crossing a prison guard line with drugs when the defendant, a corrections officer, was found with a cookie box containing drugs. Although the defendant claimed to be unaware of the contents of the package, none of the people the defendant named as being involved in the transaction were proven to exist, and the jury was authorized to infer that it was unreasonable for a corrections officer to take a suspicious package from an unknown person into a prison to give to an unknown recipient; furthermore, given the large amount and variety of contraband, its high street value, and that the defendant was taking it inside a heavily guarded prison facility, the jury was authorized to infer that the defendant intended to distribute the drugs to others instead of using the drugs personally.

        <p>
       - Proceeding before the prison commission (now Board of Corrections) for the removal of a warden is not "litigation" within the meaning of Ga. Const. 1877, Art. VII, Sec. VI, Para. II (see Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. IV, Para. I). Hence, the governing authority of a county has no authority to employ an attorney to represent it in a proceeding before the prison commission (now Board of Corrections) for the discharge of a warden.

       Prisoner's emergency motion to stay the prisoner's execution was denied because the motion was made at the last moment and without adequate explanation, the prisoner did not show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and the equities counseled against imposing the stay since the prisoner did not identify a cognizable liberty interest infringed by the Georgia Lethal Injection Secrecy Act, O.C.G.A.

       - While it is commonly understood that a warden will have a permissible interest in the performance of labor by inmates under the waarden's control as that labor benefits the county or state, the clear meaning of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c05s42-5-37" target="_self">42-5-37</a></cite> is that a warden may not receive a personal interest or benefit from the labor of inmates under the warden's control.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Although, as warden, the defendant was permitted to live rent-free in a house located on county property, the county did not benefit from routine use of inmates to perform personal housekeeping chores at the warden's home, as well as to walk the warden's dogs and clean the dog pens, baby-sit the warden's children, and wash the warden's personal vehicles. Inmates who refused to perform these chores were punished. The extensive evidence that the warden directed inmates to perform labor for the warden's personal benefit supports the warden's convictions for violating subsection (a) of O.C.G.A.

       Trial court did not err in determining that the court clerk properly discharged the clerk's duties regarding the recording and reporting of the inmate's 2011 criminal case because the printout from a Georgia Department of Corrections (GCIC) website did not evince that the clerk failed to report that the 2011 convictions had been reversed. The director of the records and reporting division with the clerk's office averred that the clerk, within 30 working days of the court's decision, notified GCIC of the court's reversal. Seibert v.

       - When one guilty of a misdemeanor is sentenced to be "confined at labor at the State Penitentiary at Reidsville, Georgia (Georgia State Prison), or such other place as the proper authority may direct," such portion of the sentence as seeks to designate the place of confinement, when no effort so to confine the prisoner is shown and since the director of the department of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) designates where most sentences are served, is mere surplusage, and, though technically not in the right form, is not such an irregularity as is hurtful to any right of liberty, or such a defect as makes the sentence void.

The county wherein the sentence is imposed shall have the sole responsibility of executing the sentence and of providing for the care, maintenance, and upkeep of the inmate while serving such sentence; provided, however, that, where the sentencing judge certifies to the department that the county facilities of that county are inadequate for maintaining female inmates, any female inmate may be committed to the department to serve her sentence in a state correctional institution, as may be directed by the department; provided, further, that the delivery of the female inmates to the proper place of incarceration shall be at the expense of the county of conviction.

If the inmate is not transferred within the 15 days, the department shall reimburse the county, in a sum not less than $7.50 per day per inmate and in such an amount as may be appropriated for this purpose by the General Assembly, for the cost of the incarceration, commencing 15 days after proper documentation is received by the department from the clerk of the court; provided, however, that, subject to an appropriation of funds, local governing authorities that have entered into memorandums of understanding or agreement or that demonstrate continuous attempts to enter into memorandums of understanding or agreement with the federal government under Section 287(g) of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act shall receive an additional payment in the amount of 10 percent of the established rate paid for reimbursement for the confinement of state inmates in local confinement facilities. The reimbursement provisions of this Code section shall only apply to payment for the incarceration of felony inmates available for transfer to the department, except inmates under death sentence awaiting transfer after their initial trial, and shall not apply to inmates who were incarcerated under the custody of the commissioner at the time they were returned to the county jail for trial on additional charges or returned to the county jail for any other purposes, including for the purpose of a new trial.

       Notwithstanding any language in the sentence as passed by the court, the commissioner may designate as a place of confinement any available, suitable, and appropriate state or county correctional institution in this state operated under the jurisdiction or supervision of the department. The commissioner shall also have sole authority to transfer inmates from one state or county correctional institution in this state to any other such institution operated by or under the jurisdiction or supervision of or approved by the board. Neither male nor female state inmates shall be assigned to serve in any manner in a county jail unless they are participating in a state sponsored project and have the approval of the commissioner and the sheriff or the jail administrator of the county. Furthermore, the commissioner may transfer to the Attorney General of the United States for confinement any inmate if it is determined that the custody, care, treatment, training, or rehabilitation of the inmate has not been adequate or in the best interest of the inmate or his fellow inmates. The commissioner is authorized to contract with the Attorney General of the United States for the custody, care, subsistence, housing, treatment, training, and rehabilitation of such inmates.

         Language in sentence designating place of incarceration surplusage.

       - When one guilty of a misdemeanor is sentenced to be "confined at labor at the State Penitentiary (Georgia State Prison) at Reidsville, Georgia, or such other place as the proper authority may direct," such portion of the sentence as seeks to designate the place of confinement, when no effort so to confine the prisoner is shown and since the director of the department of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) designates where most sentences are served, is mere surplusage, and, though technically not in the right form, is not such an irregularity as is hurtful to any right of liberty, or such a defect as makes the sentence void. Mathis v. Scott, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">35 S.E.2d 285</cite> (1945) (decided under Ga. L. 1937, p. 758).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court cannot require the Department of Corrections to place a convicted felon in a particular facility; however, language in a sentence purporting to designate a place of confinement is mere surplusage and is not a defect that will render the sentence void. Stewart v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">647 S.E.2d 411</cite> (2007).

         Superior court empowered to transfer habeas corpus petitioner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Superior court in this state has the power to order a habeas corpus petitioner under sentence of state court transferred from one penal institution to another, when this is necessary to grant the petitioner's constitutional right to meaningful access to the courts. To the extent that there exists a conflict between the statutory authority vested in the department to transfer prisoners from one correctional institute to another, and the authority vested in the superior court to enforce the Constitution, the former must yield to the latter. James v. Hight, <cite class="ga_court">251 Ga. 563</cite>, <cite class="app_court">307 S.E.2d 660</cite> (1983).

         Trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant once imprisonment imposed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Once a felony conviction was entered, and a defendant was sentenced to incarceration, the trial court lacked the authority to designate where that defendant must serve the incarceration, since this decision lies solely with the Department of Corrections under O.C.G.A.

        - All felons and misdemeanants, other than those misdemeanants committed directly to a county public works camp (now county correctional institution), must be committed directly and exclusively to the Board of Corrections; only the director of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) is authorized to prescribe the place of confinement; so much of the language of a sentence committing an inmate to a term of penal servitude in the state prison system as purports to commit the inmate to Central State Hospital is surplusage and should not be relied upon by the officials of the hospital or the Board of Corrections as authority for the retention of custody of the inmate at the hospital. 1970 Op.

The juvenile may be returned to the custody of the commissioner when the commissioner of juvenile justice determines that the juvenile is unsuited to be dealt with therein. The commissioner may accept a juvenile for transfer into a penal institution upon the request of the commissioner of juvenile justice if such juvenile is 16 years of age or older and has been committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for a class A designated felony act or class B designated felony act, as defined by Code Section 15-11-2, and such juvenile's behavior presents a substantial danger to any person at or within a Department of Juvenile Justice facility. In the event of such transfer, the department shall have the same authority over and responsibility for such juvenile as the Department of Juvenile Justice has for such juvenile and shall maintain sight and sound separation as set forth in paragraph (5) of subsection (c) of Code Section 15-11-504.

       - Ga. L. 1988, p. 1799,
   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides:
   "The General Assembly finds that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its causative agent, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), pose a grave threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state.
   In the absence of any effective vaccination or treatment for this disease, it threatens almost certain death to all who contract it.
   The disease is largely transmitted through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use, not through casual contact, and, while deadly, is therefore preventable. The key component of the fight against AIDS is education. Through public education and counseling our citizens can learn how the disease is transmitted and, thus, how to protect themselves and prevent its spread.
   The Department of Human Resources is encouraged to continue its efforts to educate all Georgians about the disease, its causative agent, and its means of transmission.
   In addition, voluntary testing should be encouraged for anyone who feels at risk of infection. While education, counseling, and voluntary testing are vital to the elimination of this epidemic, other measures are needed to protect the health of our citizens, and it is the intention of the General Assembly to enact such measures in the exercise of its police powers in order to deal with AIDS and HIV infection."

       Subject to the provisions stated in this Code section, any county may purchase, rent, establish, construct, and maintain a county correctional institution for the care and detention of all inmates assigned to it by the department. The county may contract with other counties relative to the joint care, upkeep, and working of the inmates in such counties. Each county may pay its pro rata share of such expenses by taxes assessed and levied as provided by law.

       All county correctional institutions established by the counties as provided in subsection (a) of this Code section shall be subject to supervision and control by the department, and the board shall promulgate rules and regulations governing the administration and operation thereof.

        <li id="t42c05s42-5-53ol1c2">
         The department is authorized, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the board, to pay funds, in an amount appropriated by the General Assembly for the purposes specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, for each state inmate assigned to a county correctional institution to the county operating the facility. The amount so paid shall be determined on the basis of an equal amount per day for each state inmate assigned to the county correctional institution.

       In all cases in which an inmate is the sole responsibility of a county and the board has no authority, jurisdiction, or responsibility with respect to the sentence of the inmate, the county may confine the inmate in a county correctional institution established pursuant to this Code section.

For reasons other than the failure to comply with the rules, regulations, requirements, and directives, the board is authorized to withdraw all inmates under its jurisdiction from all county correctional institutions under the following conditions:

       Board prescribes conditions of work required of prisoners

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c05s42-5-60" target="_self">42-5-60</a></cite>) that prison labor could be required in public buildings in any such manner as deemed advisable by the Board of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections), it is obvious that the legislature intended the board to prescribe the conditions of work required of the prisoners; and even though some of the prisoners are physically restrained for overnight periods in county jails, their primary assignment is, nonetheless, to the prison or public work camp (now county correctional institution) as determined by the commissioner; in turn the prison or camp has sole administrative responsibility and control of the prisoner even though the prisoner be temporarily attached to the county jail to perform the required repair or maintenance services; such a temporary attachment is not an assignment which contravenes the language of subsection (b) of Ga.

The activity must be such as, in the opinion of the warden or superintendent and the commissioner, will contribute to the rehabilitation process of the inmate involved. In order to be considered for this special leave, the inmate shall be eligible solely upon the concurrence of the warden or superintendent and the commissioner that positive attitudinal and growth patterns are being established. Under no condition shall any inmate be permitted to leave the state under this Code section. This Code section shall not apply to convicted sex offenders.

Emergency leave cannot be granted under this Code section to any inmate who has been convicted of a sex offense, who has escaped or attempted to escape within 12 months preceding the emergency, who has not served sufficient time to demonstrate his responsibility and dependability, or who has an assaultive pattern determined to exist either from the nature of the offense for which he has been convicted or from conduct while incarcerated in the penal institution. The warden or superintendent granting the emergency leave must forward immediately a written report of the action to the commissioner.

       - When a person was convicted of two felonies, and served the person's sentences concurrently, so that the person was entitled to be released upon termination of the longer sentence, the person could not have such term reduced on account of good conduct by calculating an allowance for good conduct on each of the two sentences, and deducting the aggregate time from the longer sentence.

        When an inmate's good time is forfeited
       
       the following constitutionally minimum procedures are required: (1) a hearing; (2) written notice of the charges served at least 24 hours in advance of the hearing; and (3) a written report of the hearing setting out the reasons for the action taken and the evidence relied on. The prisoner may be permitted to call witnesses and present evidence consistent with the needs of the institution. There is no constitutional right to confrontation, cross-examination, or counsel.

       There is no merit in the contention that an appellant's good-time allowance could not be forfeited because of the appellant's escape without the appellant's trial in a court of law for the crime of escape.

         Fundamental public policy underlying section
        </b>
        is orderly administration of penitentiary service of prisoners, which is enhanced by a system of rewards in which the prisoner participates through a reduction of time served; the state also benefits through a lessening of ever constant discipline problems. The state receives no benefit by awarding statutory good time to an individual not "in any prison or county public works camp (now county correctional institution) operated under the jurisdiction of the board." This section was passed to benefit both the state and the prisoner. Since the state is not benefited directly when the prisoner is not under the jurisdiction of the board, the application of the provision dealing with statutory good time would be unauthorized. 1963-65 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 143 (decided under Ga. L. 1956, p. 161).

     "(2) Under the appropriate conditions and limitations, work programs of voluntary labor by inmates of state and county correctional institutions for privately owned profit-making employers to produce goods, services, or goods and services for sale to public or private purchasers provide substantial public benefits by:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) Providing job experience and skills to participating inmates;

     "(A) Assurance that inmates' work is voluntary;
    </p>

     "(B) Payment of inmates at wages at a rate not less than that paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is to be performed;

    </p>
    <p>
     "(E) Appropriate supervision of inmates during travel or employment outside the correctional institution;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(F) Assurance that inmate labor will not result in the displacement of employed workers; be applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available gainful labor in the locality; or impair existing contracts for services;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(G) Consultations with local private employers that may be economically impacted; and

   1983 suit against a county sheriff and state prison warden failed because the inmate's erroneous transfer to prison from the county jail after the inmate was granted an appeal bond in one criminal case did not preclude the inmate from being detained on a bench warrant prior to the trial of a second criminal case; such transfers did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause because the inmate did not present any evidence the inmate's detention at the prison was qualitatively different from the inmate's detention in the jail, and pretrial detention in a prison setting was authorized by O.C.G.A.

Requiring resort to remedies under Ga.

     <p>
    - Ga. L. 1972, p. 932 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42) is designed to provide the right to a speedy trial for defendants who are not subject to the judicial power of the state having an untried indictment. The agreement has provisions for sanctions if a speedy disposition of the pending indictment is not effected. If trial is not held within 120 days of the arrival of the movant within the jurisdiction of the court in which the indictment is pending and before the movant is returned to the jurisdiction of the sending state, the untried indictment shall be dismissed with prejudice. Hunt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">147 Ga. App. 787</cite>, <cite class="app_court">250 S.E.2d 517</cite> (1978).

L. 1972, p. 932 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42)
   if it was utilized to secure the defendant's trial. Johnson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">268 S.E.2d 782</cite> (1980).

    Purpose of Ga. L. 1972, p. 932 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42)
   is to ensure speedy trial on pending charges before staleness and difficulty of proof set it. These are pretrial, and not sentencing, considerations. Suggs v.

     <p>
      The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, information or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate.

The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.

The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.

      Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint, provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by the certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint on which the detainer is based.

      The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated: provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      In respect of any proceeding made possible by this Article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.
     </p>
     <p>
      If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

      In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.
     </p>
     <p>
      The officer or other representative of a State accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:
     </p>
     <p>
      If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.

       - Since the appellant failed to comply with the requirements of Ga. L. 1972, p. 938 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42) the noncompliance renders the defendant's request for trial invalid.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court properly denied the defendant's plea in bar based on speedy-trial grounds because the defendant's incarceration in Michigan extended the time for the defendant's speedy trial demand as the defendant was not available for trial because the defendant was in the custody of a different sovereign and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c06s42-6-20" target="_self">42-6-20</a></cite> et seq., did not apply; there was no inherent authority in a Georgia court to compel the defendant's presence or in-court attendance since the defendant was incarcerated by or in the control of a different sovereign, specifically Michigan; and nothing in the record reflected the defendant's desire to waive the defendant's right to be present at trial.

       Holding that the state may ignore a prisoner's request until shortly before the expiration of the 180-day period provided in Article III, and then extend that period by initiating proceedings under Article IV, would effectively nullify the purpose of the 180-day provision of Article III and deny to a prisoner the right to a speedy trial.

       - Since the defendant sent the defendant's request for a disposition of the charges directly to the state without a warden's certificate of an inmate's status, rather than through prison authorities, and the required certificate was eventually supplied at a later date, the 180-day period provided in Article III began to run once the state received the certificate rather than when the state received the defendant's direct request.

     - Ga. L. 1985, p. 420, effective March 27, 1985, repealed the Code sections formerly codified at this chapter and enacted the current chapter. The former chapter, which also dealt with treatment of youthful offenders, consisted of Code Sections 42-7-1 through 42-7-16. The former chapter also created the Youthful Offender Division of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (now Department of Corrections) and described that former division's powers and duties. While several provisions of Code sections of the former chapter were carried forward into the new chapter (see historical citations in this chapter), the following Acts formed the basis of Code sections which were not carried forward: Ga. L. 1972, p. 592,
   §§
   3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14; Ga. L. 1975, p. 900,

   1; Ga. L. 1985, p. 149,
   §
   42; Ga. L. 1985, p. 283,
   §
   1.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ga. L. 1985, p. 420,
   §
   2, not codified by the General Assembly, provided that that Act would not operate to deny any rights to any youthful offender currently on probation pursuant to the "Georgia Youthful Offender Act of 1972," but any such person would remain on probation subject to any conditions as previously specified.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ga. L. 1998, p. 270,
   §
   13, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly recognizes that criminal street gangs have succeeded at times in maintaining their structure, organization, and discipline in penal institutions and have continued to conduct criminal activities while incarcerated. Therefore, the General Assembly requests and encourages state and local officials with responsibility for the operation of adult and juvenile penal institutions and related facilities to develop policies and procedures which will identify members of criminal street gangs and, where necessary, to separate members and associates of the same criminal street gang in order that such gang members cannot maintain the gang's structure, organization, and discipline and will have a more difficult time in conducting criminal activities while incarcerated in this state."

     - When a youthful offender's conditional release is revoked, and the youth is not returned to the youthful offender program, the youth's status as a youthful offender is terminated and the youth's sentence should be computed on the basis of six years or the maximum term for the offense, if less than six years. 1975 Op.

     <p>

     When a combination of youthful offender and standard sentences occur,
    
    the Youthful Offender Division may not approve a conditional or unconditional release for the described youthful offender until the youth's concurrent standard sentence had expired; nevertheless, the youth could be assigned to an institution maintained primarily for youthful offenders during the entire period for which the board was charged with custody over the youth, since Ga.

        <p>
       - Labeling an investigative report of the probation department as a "post-sentence" report, as distinguished from a "presentence" report, will not change the report's legal effect when the content, purpose, and function of the report are the same. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).

       - Trial court erred in imposing the maximum sentence with the intent of utilizing a later report to determine the final length of sentence. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - There is no discernible difference between a "presentence" and "post-sentence" report, except as to time of submission, and this is of no import when each is used for the same purpose. Thus, it is permissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or some part of a sentence. For the same reason it is impermissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report in fixing the length of the sentence. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the trial court intended to use the "post-sentence" report to determine the final length of the sentence, it was implicit that the trial court imposed the original sentence with the intent of determining a final length of sentence only after viewing the "post-sentence" investigative report. In such instance, Munford v. State, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 38</cite>, <cite class="app_court">218 S.E.2d 792</cite> (1975) and Mills v. State, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 186</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 445</cite> (1979) proscribed the use of the reports to determine "length" of sentence without compliance with the provisions of former Code 1933,

         Vague sentence on charge of abandonment.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the sentence on a charge of abandonment did not specify whether the payments required thereunder were in the nature of a fine or a payment for the support of the defendant's child or children, and failed to specify where or to whom the payments were to be made, this provision of the sentence was too vague and indefinite to be enforceable, and a revocation of the probation sentence solely on the ground that the defendant did not make the payments specified was without authority of law.

       - If a presentence probation officer's report contains any matter adverse to the defendant and likely to influence the decision to suspend or probate the sentence, it should be revealed to defense counsel by the trial judge in advance of the presentence hearing to give the accused an opportunity for explanation or rebuttal.

        <p>
       - Labeling an investigative report of the probation department as a "post-sentence" report, as contra-distinguished from a "presentence" report, will not change the report's legal effect where the content, the purpose, and function of the report are the same.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because there is no discernible difference between a "presentence" and "post-sentence" report, except as to time of submission, this is of no import when each is used for the same purpose. Thus, it is permissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or some part of a sentence. For the same reason it is impermissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report in fixing the length of the sentence. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the trial court intended to use the "post-sentence" report to determine the final length of the sentence, it was implicit that the trial court imposed the original sentence with the intent of determining a final length of sentence only after viewing the "post-sentence" investigative report. In such instance, Munford v. State, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 38</cite>, <cite class="app_court">218 S.E.2d 792</cite> (1975) and Mills v. State, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 186</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 445</cite> (1979), proscribe the use of the reports to determine "length" of sentence without compliance with the provisions of former Code 1933,

       - Because the ability of a defendant to pay a fine is often a factor for the sentencing judge to consider in assessing the likelihood that the defendant will serve a term of probation without violation, a conditionally probated sentence is not necessarily invidious discrimination based on wealth if the sentencing judge has determined that the defendant would not be a good candidate for probation unless a fine is paid first.

       Trial court's power to rescind, modify, or change a sentence "at any time" is limited by its terms to the sentence itself or its conditions and the court may not go behind the sentence to readdress the merits of a plea which was ruled on in a preceding term.

       Trial court had authority to require the defendant to undergo treatment as a sex offender after the defendant began serving the defendant's probated sentence, and the addition of such a condition was authorized whether or not there had been a violation of existing conditions of probation.

       Order modifying the trial court's prior banishment order imposed as a condition of the defendant's probation was upheld on appeal, as was the denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw a negotiated plea because: (1) the defendant's sentence was independent, and thus, not part of the negotiated plea agreement; and (2) the trial court adequately considered that the defendant's crimes were likely motivated by the relationship the defendant had with the victim, the defendant's ex-spouse, where the ex-spouse resided and worked, as well as where the ex-spouse's immediate family lived, by determining that the banishment order was issued to protect those affected, but also served a rehabilitative purpose by removing a temptation by the defendant to re-offend.

       Trial court did not err in modifying the probationary portion of the defendant's sentence because the court retained jurisdiction to modify the terms of the defendant's probation; although the trial court's order modifying the defendant's probated sentence was not entered until the subsequent term of court, the state filed its motion to modify the sentence within the same term in which the sentence was originally rendered.

       - Defendant who complained that the defendant was unable to pay restitution because the defendant was also paying child support was ordered, as a condition of probation, to provide proof of the child support payments that the defendant made.

       - While a sentencing court retains jurisdiction over a defendant during any period of probation and may modify or correct the probated sentence as necessary, a writ of habeas corpus is an available avenue of relief in cases wherein a defendant not only seeks a modification of the conditions of the probation but also asserts that the sentence imposed was unconstitutional.

       - Trial court has no power to amend and modify a sentence in a criminal case after the term during which the sentence was imposed; accordingly, if the defendant had been sentenced to an indeterminate term in the penitentiary without any provision for probation, the court properly refused to entertain a motion made at a subsequent term that the sentence be modified so as to allow the defendant to serve the sentence on probation.

       At any revocation hearing, upon proof that the defendant has violated any general provision of probation or suspension other than by commission of a new felony offense, the court shall consider the use of alternatives to include community service, probation detention centers, special alternative incarceration, or any other alternative to confinement deemed appropriate by the court or as provided by the state or county. In the event the court determines that the defendant does not meet the criteria for such alternatives, the court may revoke the balance of probation or not more than two years in confinement, whichever is less.

For purposes of this Code section, the term "felony offense" means:

        <p>
       Because the relevant sentencing documents failed to state that a probationer's failure to complete a diversion center program would result in the court revoking probation and requiring the probationer to serve the balance of the original sentence in prison, and the original sentencing form did not comply with O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-34.1" target="_self">42-8-34.1</a></cite>, the trial court erred in revoking the remainder of the probationer's probation term; moreover, despite the state's contention that the probationer waived any issue regarding the wording of the sentence by consenting to the consent order, there was no basis found in the record for the appeals court to find such. Gamble v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 37</cite>, <cite class="app_court">658 S.E.2d 785</cite> (2008).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-34.1" target="_self">42-8-34.1</a></cite> governs the requirements for revocation of a probated sentence, and specifically repealed, without a savings clause, the prior statutory provision and all conflicting laws; the amended provision precluded the trial court from considering the prior, unamended statute during a revocation hearing as the court was bound by the revocation requirements in effect at the time defendant's probation was revoked, not at the time the defendant was sentenced to probation. Gardner v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">259 Ga. App. 375</cite>, <cite class="app_court">577 S.E.2d 69</cite> (2003).

       - Trial court abused its discretion in revoking the defendant's probation based upon incompetent and insufficient evidence; the only evidence that a crime was committed was an officer's hearsay testimony that the officer was told that an air compressor was stolen and that testimony was offered only to show the officer's reasons for conducting an investigation. Smith v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 317</cite>, <cite class="app_court">641 S.E.2d 296</cite> (2007).

       - Because the revocation petition did not specify which Code section the defendant was alleged to have violated for the drug-related objects offense and instead simply accused the defendant of possessing certain specified drug-related objects, the only violation alleged and proven fell under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.16.html#t16c13s16-13-32.2" target="_blank">16-13-32.2</a></cite>, a misdemeanor; therefore, the trial court was not authorized to revoke more than two years of the defendant's outstanding probation. Henley v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">317 Ga. App. 776</cite>, <cite class="app_court">732 S.E.2d 836</cite> (2012).

        <p>
       - When, after the defendant's probation revocation hearing, the trial court ordered the defendant to serve six months in jail for each of the seven probation violations found to total three and one-half years, that order violated the plain words of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-34.1" target="_self">42-8-34.1</a></cite>, limiting confinement for probation revocation to no more than two years. Cockrell v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">263 Ga. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">433 S.E.2d 585</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Revocation of the balance of four and one-half years of the defendant's probation based on the commission of two new violent misdemeanors was error because, when the sole basis for revoking probation is the commission of a new misdemeanor, whether violent or not, the cap is two years. Lawrence v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">228 Ga. App. 745</cite>, <cite class="app_court">492 S.E.2d 727</cite> (1997).

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-34.1ol1c" target="_self">42-8-34.1(c)</a></cite> placed a two-year limitation on the period of confinement which may be ordered when probation was revoked because of a violation of a general provision of probation; a trial court's revocation order, which could possibly have been construed as ordering more than two years in confinement, was improper. Jordan v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">279 Ga. App. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">635 S.E.2d 163</cite> (2006).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When nothing in the record showed that the trial court considered alternatives to confinement, the court erred in ordering a defendant who had violated probation to serve more than two years in confinement.

       Trial court properly revoked the defendant's probation as a result of finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant engaged in a conspiracy to commit a forgery by buying a roll of holograph-imprinted laminate from an inmate to make fraudulent driver's licenses; but the trial court erred in revoking seven instead of just five years of the defendant's probation because, pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-34.1ol1d" target="_self">42-8-34.1(d)</a></cite>, the maximum sentence authorized was the lesser of the balance of probation or the maximum time of the sentence authorized to be imposed for the crime constituting the violation of the probation. Since conspiracy to commit first degree forgery was punishable by no more than five years imprisonment, and the defendant had seven years of probation left, only five years should have been revoked.

       On appeal from an order revoking a probationer's probation, the trial court erred by admitting the results of a Roche "OnTrack TesTstik" without a showing that the test had reached a scientific state of verifiable certainty, which would allow admission of the test's results in the absence of expert testimony; on remand, the court was directed to determine whether the court would have revoked the balance of the probation term based upon the probationer's failure to comply with the special condition of restitution standing alone, or impose a lesser penalty instead.

   Special condition of probation means a condition of a probated or suspended sentence which: (1) is expressly imposed as part of the sentence in addition to general conditions of probation and court ordered fines and fees; and (2) is identified in writing in the sentence as a condition the violation of which authorizes the court to revoke the probation or suspension and requires the defendant to serve up to the balance of the sentence in confinement.

       Trial court did not err in revoking probation on the ground that the probationer committed the felony offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute because it was within the court's discretion to find that a sufficient foundation had been laid to allow an officer to state the officer's opinion that the substance found in the car in which the probationer was riding was cocaine when the officer testified that the officer had been a member of the narcotics investigation unit for five years, that the officer had received training in the visual identification of cocaine, and that the officer had personally worked over 200 cases where the officer had seized suspected cocaine, which subsequently tested positive for cocaine; the trial court did not manifestly abuse the court's discretion when the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the substance was cocaine and that the probationer had constructive possession of the cocaine because in addition to the officer's opinion on the identity of the substance, the record contained other circumstantial evidence indicating that the substance was cocaine, and the driver of the car denied that the cocaine was the driver's and stated that the cocaine was thrown to the floorboard under the driver's feet by the probationer.

       - Trial court was authorized to find, under the preponderance of the evidence standard, that the defendant's presence on private property caused a justifiable and reasonable alarm for the safety of the property, and the revocation of the defendant's probation was proper for the offense of criminal trespass and loitering or prowling when the record showed that the defendant climbed through a hole in a fence around private property at a time when the business was closed and the gate shut, where a manager called police, and where, when the defendant was told that police had been summoned, the defendant left the scene; there was no evidence that the defendant's economic status or homelessness factored into the trial court's decision to revoke defendant's probation.

       - Trial court committed reversible error in revoking the defendant's probation for failure to pay court-ordered fines and fees because the trial court made the court's determination without making the findings the United States Supreme Court required in revocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution, but rather, the trial court inquired only as to the defendant's fitness to work before deciding to revoke the defendant's probation; in order to revoke the defendant's probation based solely on the failure to pay those costs, the trial court was required to make a finding as to the defendant's wilfulness, and if the court concluded that the defendant was not at fault, the trial court was required to consider other punishment alternatives, which the court did not do.

       - Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probation on the ground that the defendant violated a condition of the probation by possessing a firearm because the state did not carry the state's burden of showing that the defendant was in possession of the rifle found leaning against the front porch of the defendant's trailer since the probation officer acknowledged that the rifle could have belonged to any one of the defendant's neighbors; there must be something more than mere spatial proximity that links the probationer to the prohibited item.

       - Ga. L. 2004, p. 761,
   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "The General Assembly finds that the safety of the public is a paramount concern and that prison and jail overcrowding and the high cost of incarceration demand a cost effective and innovative approach to protecting communities from dangerous offenders while at the same time providing alternatives to, or bridges to and from incarceration. Under appropriate conditions and limitations, electronic monitoring devices provide the criminal justice system with a tool that should be considered under proper circumstances. Electronic monitoring devices offer effective means to track individuals and may reduce criminal recidivism as well as provide the state with monetary savings since the cost of an electronic monitoring device is far less than the cost of incarcerating an individual and an individual may be able to pay for the device. The criminal penalties provided by this Act are designed to encourage the use of electronic monitoring devices while at the same time discourage interference with these devices."

       Ga. L. 2012, p. 899,

   Any offense occurring before July 1, 2012, shall be governed by the statute in effect at the time of such offense and shall be considered a prior conviction for the purpose of imposing a sentence that provides for a different penalty for a subsequent conviction for the same type of offense, of whatever degree or level, pursuant to this Act."

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court erred in denying a probationer's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the probationer's apartment as, even though the entry into the apartment for the purpose of effecting an arrest of the probationer was permissible, most of the evidence was seized without a warrant after the probationer was not found in the apartment and had to be excluded under the Fourth Amendment as the search conducted was only permissible insofar as the search involved the observation of items of obvious evidentiary value in plain view during the time and activities required to attempt the probationer's arrest. The probationer was never placed on notice that the probationer was going to be subjected to warrantless searches, and the state failed to demonstrate any exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search.

       - This section is not exclusive in its provisions, but places upon the court authority to set terms of probation and thereafter lists certain conditions which the court may impose if the court sees fit.

       This section permits the court to determine the terms and conditions of probation, and lists ten conditions of probation. Parkerson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 440</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 799</cite> (1980).

        <p>
       Absent inclusion of a record and an express authority to the contrary, the trial judge was authorized to impose attendance at the Chatham County DUI court treatment program as a condition of the defendant's probation; further, imposition was not a denial of the defendant's equal protection rights in that nonresidents were not required to attend, especially and in light of the fact that the defendant failed to show any evidence to show the genesis, nature, or content of the program of which
   the defendant complained. Kellam v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">271 Ga. App. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">608 S.E.2d 729</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant that the cited probation conditions were peculiar to a DUI conviction, because the defendant failed to cite any authority showing that a court abused the court's discretion in imposing the condition's upon a probated sentence for serious injury by vehicle, when DUI was the predicate offense, and the defendant failed to show that any such condition was unreasonable or failed to serve the main goals of probation, the appeals court saw no reason why the cited conditions could not be imposed upon a probated sentence for serious injury by vehicle. Hannah v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">280 Ga. App. 230</cite>, <cite class="app_court">633 S.E.2d 800</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In overruling the defendant's objection to the probation imposed, the trial court erroneously deferred to the probation department in stating that any invalid conditions could be removed by the probation department; the appeals court disapproved of such a practice as O.C.G.A.

       Habeas court properly denied the defendant's petition for habeas relief based on the contention that a condition of probation banishing the defendant from every county in the State of Georgia but one was unconstitutional as the defendant failed to show that the probation condition to remain in Toombs County only was unreasonable or otherwise failed to bear a logical relationship to the rehabilitative scheme of the sentence pronounced. The Supreme Court of Georgia noted that the banishment was justified to protect the victim, the defendant's ex-spouse, from the defendant's propensity for violence toward the victim. Terry v.

       Trial court did not err in modifying the probationary portion of the defendant's sentence by imposing a condition banishing the defendant from the subdivision in which the defendant committed burglaries because the trial court's original sentencing order included as a special condition of probation that the defendant was to avoid all contact with the burglary victims, each of whom lived in the subdivision at issue, and to the extent that the modified sentence simply clarified the scope of that special condition, it was contemplated within the terms of the original sentence pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-34ol1g" target="_self">42-8-34(g)</a></cite>; the banishment provision was reasonable, narrow in scope, and included only the subdivision in which the victims resided, and in the absence of a hearing transcript or any record evidence to the contrary, the court of appeals had to presume that the trial court properly considered the evidence before the court.

       Although the legislature has expressly provided that banishment is a valid term and condition of probation, the trial court cannot banish a probationer to any area within the state that does not consist of at least one entire judicial circuit. Because Toombs County was part of the five-county Middle Judicial Circuit, which also included Emanuel, Jefferson, Washington, and Candler Counties, the trial court was not statutorily authorized to banish the defendant from the entire state, except for Toombs County.

        <p>
       - Sentences for criminal offenses should be certain, definite, and free from ambiguity, and, when the contrary is the case, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused. Hence, the trial court erred in revoking a purported probation sentence since construed as a whole, the sentence was an alternative one and the defendant was to be discharged upon payment of fines and costs.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Evidence was insufficient when notice contained in special order of arrest charged the defendant with manufacturing illicit whiskey, but no evidence was introduced; mere fact that the defendant was operating a truck loaded with sugar, and the defendant refused to give the name of the purchaser or seller of the sugar and had no bill of lading or bill of sale for the sugar, which facts were perfectly consistent with the defendant's contention that the defendant was doing some hauling, was of itself not sufficient to authorize revocation of the probation order.

        <p>
       When notice contained in order of arrest failed to charge the defendant with violation of the provision of the probation order prohibiting the defendant from leaving the state without permission, mere fact that the defendant was stopped in Alabama was not sufficient ground for revocation thereof.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the court cannot revoke a probated sentence unless the sentence has conditions sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and unless the conditions have not been complied with, and since the defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the charge which is brought against the defendant, only those alleged violations which are terms of the original sentence, and notice of the violation of which has been given the probationer, may be considered by the court on the hearing to revoke the probated sentence.

       - When no rules or regulations are prescribed in the alleged suspended or probated sentence, and no violation of a prescribed rule or regulation is alleged, the court is without authority to order the defendant incarcerated upon the theory that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of a probation sentence.

Att'y Gen. No. 81-100.

       Notwithstanding any other terms or conditions of probation which may be imposed, a court may provide that probationers sentenced for felony offenses to a period of time of not less than one year on probation as a condition of probation shall satisfactorily complete a program of confinement in a special alternative incarceration - probation boot camp unit of the Department of Corrections for a period of 120 days computed from the time of initial confinement in the unit; provided, however, that the Department of Corrections may release the defendant upon service of 90 days in recognition of excellent behavior.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1b">
       Before a court may place such condition upon the sentence, an initial investigation shall be completed by the officer which indicates that the probationer is qualified for such treatment in that the individual does not appear to be physically or mentally disabled in a way that would prevent him or her from strenuous physical activity, that the individual has no obvious contagious diseases, that the individual is not less than 17 years of age nor more than 30 years of age at the time of sentencing, and that the Department of Corrections has granted provisional approval of the placement of the individual in the special alternative incarceration - probation boot camp unit.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1c">
       In every case when an individual is sentenced under the terms of this Code section, the sentencing court shall, within its probation order, direct the Department of Corrections to arrange with the sheriff's office in the county of incarceration to have the individual delivered to a designated unit of the Department of Corrections within a specific date not more than 15 days after the issuance of such probation order by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1d">
       At any time during the individual's confinement in the unit, but at least five days prior to his or her expected date of release, the Department of Corrections shall certify to the trial court as to whether the individual has satisfactorily completed the condition of probation provided in subsection (a) of this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1e">
       Upon the receipt of a satisfactory report of performance in the program from the Department of Corrections, the trial court shall release the individual from confinement in the special alternative incarceration - probation boot camp unit. However, the receipt of an unsatisfactory report shall be grounds for revocation of the probated sentence as would any other violation of a condition or term of probation.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1f">
       The satisfactory report of performance in the program from the Department of Corrections shall, in addition to the other requirements specified in this Code section, require participation of the individual confined in the unit in such adult education courses necessary to attain the equivalency of a grade five competency level as established by the State Board of Education for elementary schools. Those individuals who are mentally disabled as determined by initial testing shall be exempt from mandatory participation. After the individual is released from the unit, it shall be a special condition of probation that the individual participate in an education program in the community until grade five level competency is achieved or active probation supervision terminates. It shall be the duty of the Department of Corrections to certify to the trial court that such individual has satisfactorily completed such condition of probation while on active probation supervision. The receipt of an unsatisfactory report may be grounds for revocation of the probated sentence as would any other violation of a condition or term of probation. Under certain circumstances, the probationer may be exempt from this requirement if it is determined by the officer that community education resources are inaccessible to the probationer.

       <p>
        <p>
       - It was error to hold that a probationer's failure to abide by the diversion center's regulations made the probationer liable for the felony offense of escape rather than for the mere revocation of the probationer's probation. Unsatisfactory performance in the program would subject the probationer to revocation of probation as specified by O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-38" target="_self">42-8-38</a></cite>; however an alternative to revocation of probation would be the imposition of the more severe sanctions of O.C.G.A.

      effective July 1, 2015, substituted the present provisions of this Code section for the former provisions, which read: "Unless the court has ordered more frequent such screenings, it shall be the duty of each probation supervisor to administer or have administered a drug and alcohol screening not less than once every 60 days to any person who is placed on probation and who, as a condition of such probation, is required to undergo regular, random drug and alcohol screenings, provided that the drug and alcohol screenings required by this Code section shall be performed only to the extent that necessary funds therefor are appropriated in the state budget."

       <p>
        - State probation officer was entitled to qualified immunity as to a probationer's malicious prosecution claim based on the officer's sentence miscalculation because it was not clearly established that the officer's alleged conduct would subject the officer to liability since there were published decisions from the court granting absolute immunity to probation officers who were alleged to have made material misrepresentations that impacted the offender's sentence.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When a person is placed under a probation sentence, probation cannot be revoked without notice to probationer and an opportunity to be heard on the question as to whether the probationer violated its terms. Rainwater v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 406</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 889</cite> (1972).

        Minimum requirements of due process for parole revocation
       
       are a written statement by the fact finders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole. Reed v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 224</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 209</cite> (1979).
       </p>

        <p>

        Hearing required need not meet the requisites of a jury trial;
       
       the proceedings may be informal or summary. Rainwater v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 406</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 889</cite> (1972).

       <p>
        <p>

        Judge is the sole trier of fact
       
       and when there is even slight evidence the appellate court will not interfere with the revocation unless there has been an abuse of discretion. Rainwater v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 406</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 889</cite> (1972).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Parole cannot lawfully be revoked as a mere matter of caprice. In such hearing the judge is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses, but the judge is not permitted to withdraw a parole unless there is sufficient evidence to authorize a finding that one or more of the conditions upon which the parole was granted has been violated.

        <p>
       When it cannot be determined whether the criminal act charged against the probationer as in violation of the probationer's parole was committed prior to the imposition of the sentence or subsequent thereto, a finding revoking the parole would be contrary to law and would not be authorized. Williams v. State, <cite class="ga_court">162 Ga. 327</cite>, <cite class="app_court">133 S.E. 843</cite> (1926).

Vincent v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">271 Ga. App. 138</cite>, <cite class="app_court">608 S.E.2d 748</cite> (2004).
       </p>

        <p>
       Because no language in a probation revocation affidavit indicated that the defendant had absconded and could not be found, and the warrant stated only that the defendant was in arrears in the payment of ordered restitution, a trial court erred in tolling the defendant's probation pursuant to O.C.G.A.

Any officer authorized by law to issue warrants may issue a warrant for the arrest of the probationer upon the affidavit of one having knowledge of the alleged violation, returnable forthwith before the court in which revocation proceedings are being brought.

If the charge is not dismissed at this time, the court shall give the probationer an opportunity to be heard fully at the earliest possible date on his or her own behalf, in person or by counsel, provided that, if the revocation proceeding is in a court other than the court of the original criminal conviction, the sentencing court shall be given ten days' written notice prior to a hearing on the merits.

The clerk shall send copies of the order revoking probation to DCS and the Department of Corrections to serve as a temporary commitment and shall send the original order revoking probation and all other papers pertaining thereto to the county of original conviction to be filed with the original records.

       <p>
        <p>
       - It was error to hold that a probationer's failure to abide by the diversion center's regulations made the probationer liable for the felony offense of escape rather than for the mere revocation of the probationer's probation. Unsatisfactory performance in the program would subject the probationer to revocation of probation as specified by O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-38" target="_self">42-8-38</a></cite>; however, an alternative to revocation of probation would be the imposition of the more severe sanctions of O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - That the quantum of proof necessary to revoke probation has been changed from "slight evidence" to "a preponderance of the evidence" does not affect the rule that a ruling in favor of the probationer, continuing rather than revoking probation, has no collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent criminal trial.

       - After the defendant received a sentence which unambiguously revoked the defendant's prior probation, the defendant fully served the time imposed therein, and there was no indication in the sentence that any portion of the defendant's probation was to be reinstated upon the defendant's release, that sentence was fully satisfied when the defendant was released from jail, and the court's order subsequently revoking the defendant's probation was invalid as there was nothing left to revoke.

        <p>
       When a convicted defendant's "future good behavior" has already been compromised by the commission of another criminal act even before the formal probationary period begins, a trial court should not be required to allow such defendant to serve a previously imposed probated sentence when the court deems that protection of society demands revocation.

       - Trial court erred in denying a probationer's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the probationer's apartment as, even though the entry into the apartment for the purpose of effecting an arrest of the probationer was permissible, most of the evidence seized without a warrant after the probationer was not found in the apartment had to be excluded under the Fourth Amendment as the search conducted was only permissible insofar as the search involved the observation of items of obvious evidentiary value in plain view during the time and activities required to attempt the probationer's arrest. The probationer was never placed on notice that the probationer was going to be subjected to warrantless searches, and the state failed to demonstrate any exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search.

       Judge in the Dublin judicial circuit had jurisdiction to revoke a former prisoner's probation because: (1) while the prisoner pled guilty in the Macon judicial circuit and the prisoner's sentence was probated, the prisoner was involved in a theft which resulted in a partial revocation of probation and assignment to a probation detention center in the Dublin judicial circuit and, during the prisoner's confinement in the Dublin judicial circuit, the prisoner violated the terms of the prisoner's probation; and (2) because the prisoner was under supervision in a judicial circuit other than that of the prisoner's conviction, the prisoner was properly returned to a court of equivalent original criminal jurisdiction within the county wherein the prisoner was residing for the purposes of supervision under O.C.G.A.

       - When an act on which revocation of probation is based is a felony, it is not erroneous for the hearing judge to base revocation on that accusation, before the accused shall have first been tried and found guilty of the criminal charge.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Following technical violations of the conditions of probation, short of conviction for another crime or a determination of initial ineligibility, the trial court had discretion to continue a first offender on probation without first revoking first offender status, entering an adjudication of guilt, or resentencing for the underlying offense.

       <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-38" target="_self">42-8-38</a></cite> ties the affidavit requirement for the issuance of arrest warrants to the validity of a subsequent revocation of probation.
       
       Even if the defendant's arrest on charges of violating the defendant's probation was illegal, that is not a bar to the subsequent revocation of the defendant's probation. Walker v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the court cannot revoke a probated sentence unless that sentence has conditions sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and unless those conditions have not been complied with, and since the defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the charge which is brought against the defendant, only those alleged violations which are terms of the original sentence, and notice of the violation of which has been given the probationer, may be considered by the court on the hearing to revoke the probated sentence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - Because parole and probation revocation proceedings are not designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law and, because the purpose of parole and probation revocation proceedings is to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of the probationer's parole or probation, such proceedings are fundamentally distinguishable from juvenile proceedings, the latter being indistinguishable from a criminal prosecution, and, thus, the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const., amend. 5 does not apply to parole and probation revocation proceedings.

        Minimum requirements of due process for parole revocation

       Although this section does not require it, "a written statement by the fact finders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking probation" has been established as a minimum due process requirement in assuring the constitutional rights of an individual who will be condemned to suffer grievous loss by restraint of liberty.

       - When probation is sought to be revoked, the defendant is entitled to notice, which notice must be sufficient to inform the defendant of the manner in which the defendant has violated the defendant's parole and give the defendant an opportunity to defend. George v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 892</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 883</cite> (1959).
       </p>

       Failure to afford probationer notice and a hearing would render a revocation order void for lack of due process of law. Sellers v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       In order to revoke the probationary features of a sentence the defendant must have notice and opportunity to be heard, the notice being sufficient to inform the defendant not only of the time and place of the hearing and the fact that revocation is sought, but the grounds upon which it is based.

       - Hearing of this character is not a trial on a criminal charge, but is a hearing to judicially determine whether the conduct of the defendant during the probation period has conformed to the course outlined in the order of probation. If the act which violated the probation should happen to be a criminal one, it does not thereby change the character of the hearing. Sparks v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">77 Ga.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-38" target="_self">42-8-38</a></cite>) is not unconstitutional as a violation of Ga. Const. Art. I, Sec. I, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI) because no provision is made for trial by jury upon the hearing to determine whether a parole shall be revoked. Probation is granted as a privilege, and not as a matter of right; and the revocation of the probation is punishment for the crime for which the defendant was convicted in the first instance.

       <p>
        <p>
       - If an affiant shows ample facts to authorize the issuing magistrate to conclude that there is probable cause to believe that a crime of the nature set forth in the affidavits has been committed and that evidence of the crime would be produced by a search of the premises described in the affidavits, the fact that much of the affiant's information is derived from informants will not vitiate the warrant.

       - When no exception was taken to order revoking probation as provided by law, the petitioner may not seek review, by habeas corpus, of the judgment revoking the probationary sentence imposed upon his wife, since habeas corpus cannot be used as a substitute for appeal or other remedial procedure, for the correction of errors or irregularities alleged to have been committed by a trial court.

       - One serving sentence on probation is fulfilling sentence as effectually as if confined in jail or on chain gang, and accordingly, if after a hearing the order granting such probation is revoked, the time served by the defendant before the revocation must be counted in the defendant's favor and deducted from the period of service imposed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - It was general practice in Georgia for a warrant to be issued by a court on a written petition calling to the court's attention the alleged delinquency of a probationer, but the only requirement was that the defendant receive "due examination," which means that the defendant be given notice and an opportunity to be heard, and there being no requirement that the proceeding be initiated by written petition of the solicitor general (now district attorney), technical defects in such a petition when filed would not vitiate the warrant issued by the court or subsequent proceedings thereon, provided the requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard are complied with. Jackson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 291</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 444</cite> (1954), overruled on other grounds, Jackson v.

       - To deprive a defendant of the defendant's liberty upon the theory that the defendant has violated any of the rules and regulations prescribed in a suspended or probated sentence without giving the defendant notice and opportunity to be heard upon the question of whether or not the defendant has violated such rules and regulations, would violate one of the fundamental tenets that a person shall not be deprived of the defendant's liberty without due process of law, which includes notice and an opportunity to be heard.

        <p>
       - When, after due examination, the court revokes the court's order to the probationer to serve the remainder of the probationer's sentence outside the confines of the chain gang, jail, or other place of detention, Court of Appeals will not interfere unless a manifest abuse of discretion on the part of the lower court appears.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Judge is the trier of the facts in a case for the revocation of probation and has very wide discretion and unless a manifest abuse of such discretion on the part of the lower court appears, the appellate court will not interfere. Alewine v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">79 Ga. App. 779</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 507</cite> (1949).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Degree of evidence necessary to convict in a criminal case being that which convinces the jury of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and the degree necessary to support the revocation of a probation sentence being only some evidence that the defendant has violated the conditions of the probation, which satisfies the trial court hearing the case in the exercise of a very wide discretion - it is not necessary to show that the defendant has been convicted of the act constituting the condition of the probation; the sole issue before the trial court is that of whether or not the defendant has committed the act. Bryant v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">89 Ga. App. 891</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 556</cite> (1954).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Violation of the conditions of probation must be established with reasonable certainty so as to satisfy the conscience of the court of the truth of the violation. It does not have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In such a hearing if the evidence inclines a reasonable and impartial mind to the belief that the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation, it is sufficient. Sparks v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">77 Ga. App. 22</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E.2d 678</cite> (1948).

       <p>
        <p>
       - It is not the record of conviction, but the fact of guilt of violation of a condition of probation, which determines whether probation should be revoked, and in determining this question the trial judge is not bound by the same rules of evidence as a jury in passing upon the guilt or innocence of the accused in the first instance. It is not necessary that the evidence support the finding beyond a reasonable doubt or even by a preponderance of the evidence; the judge is the trier of the facts, and the judge has a very wide discretion.

        <p>
       - When a probationer is arrested on an order of the trial court directing that the probationer be placed in custody until a given date and then brought before the court for examination to determine the issue of whether or not the probationer's probation shall be revoked, and such probationer is brought before the court under arrest at the time and place specified, and counsel for the probationer also appears and represents the probationer at the hearing, it will be presumed that the probationer had proper notice and ample opportunity to be heard, it not appearing that counsel made any motion for a continuance to allow additional time to prepare the defense.

       - To deprive a defendant of the defendant's liberty upon the theory that the defendant has violated rules and regulations prescribed in the defendant's sentence, when no rules, regulations, conditions, limitations, or restrictions were imposed by such sentence, would deprive the defendant of "due process of law."

       - When sentence on charge of abandonment did not specify whether payments required were in the nature of fine or as payments for the support of the defendant's child or children, and failed to specify where or to whom the payments were to be made, this provision of the sentence was too vague and indefinite to be enforceable, and a revocation of the probation sentence solely on the ground that the defendant did not make the payments specified was without authority of law.

However, service of any sentence so suspended in abandonment cases may be ordered at any time before the child reaches the age of 21.

       - If a presentence probation report contains any matter adverse to the defendant and likely to influence the decision to suspend or probate the sentence, it should be revealed to defense counsel by the trial judge in advance of the presentence hearing to give the accused an opportunity for explanation or rebuttal.

      Sentence admissible in murder trial.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - At the sentencing phase of a murder trial, the state offered in aggravation an indictment, the defendant's plea of guilty to the indictment, and a sentence imposed under O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 8, T. 42 for the offenses of entering an automobile and theft by taking. This evidence was admissible, since evidence in aggravation is not limited to convictions, and reliable information tending to show a defendant's general bad character is admissible in aggravation.

       - Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) did not abuse the Board's discretion when the Board denied the alien's motion to reopen because: (1) the alien pled guilty to two counts of child molestation and received five years probation on each count, thereby satisfying the requirements of 8 U.S.C.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-60ol1a" target="_self">42-8-60(a)</a></cite> did not mean that the alien lacked a "conviction" for purposes of 8 U.S.C.
   §
   1227; (2) nothing in the alien's extraordinary motion for a new trial, the state's nolle prosse motion, or the superior court's orders indicated that the alien's guilty plea was taken in violation of Georgia law or the federal constitution; (3) although it was uncontroverted that a full and unconditional pardon would have defeated the charge that the alien was removable under 8 U.S.C.
   §
   1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the BIA did not abuse the Board's discretion when the Board refused to consider the alien's uncertified copy of the alien's pardon; and (4) even if the BIA had considered the alien's pardon, the pardon would not have eliminated the additional grounds for removal that the alien conceded to at the removal hearing.

       - Notwithstanding the fact that a conviction does not result unless the person sentenced fails to complete satisfactorily the probationary period, the record of a first offender sentence may be used to impeach a witness in a civil action.

       - Granting first offender treatment to the defendant for crimes for which the defendant could have been barred from seeking office for ten years constituted consideration for a plea agreement. State v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">215 Ga. App. 401</cite>, <cite class="app_court">451 S.E.2d 82</cite> (1994), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="ga_court">265 Ga. 489</cite>, <cite class="app_court">458 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1995).

       <p>
        <p>
       - If an offender does not take advantage of an opportunity for rehabilitation, the offender's trial which has been suspended is continued and an adjudication of guilt is made and a sentence entered. State v. Wiley, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">210 S.E.2d 790</cite> (1974).

       If, by violating the terms of the defendant's probation, the defendant shows that the defendant is not worthy of the offered opportunity for rehabilitation then, and only then is the defendant sentenced to the penitentiary. No former adjudication of guilt having been made and no prior sentence having been entered thereon, the defendant is subject to receive any sentence permitted by law for the offense the defendant has been found guilty of committing.

        <p>
       - Certified copy of a criminal conviction constitutes sufficient evidence of a violation of the stated term of probation. Crawford v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 272</cite>, <cite class="app_court">304 S.E.2d 443</cite> (1983).

       <p>
        <p>
       Better practice would be to introduce evidence of the criminal offense underlying the conviction as well as a certified copy of the conviction itself. If that is done, the fact that the conviction is reversed on appeal because of error, or because the evidence does not support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, will not vitiate a revocation of probation properly based on slight evidence of the criminal offense. Crawford v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 272</cite>, <cite class="app_court">304 S.E.2d 443</cite> (1983).
       </p>

        <p>
       Only slight evidence of the occurrence of probation violation will support a revocation. Crawford v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       As in probation revocation proceedings, only slight evidence is necessary to support a termination of probation under the first offender statute. Evans v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">185 Ga. App. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">366 S.E.2d 165</cite> (1988).

       Because the evidence showed that the probationer had continuous access to the firearms in the house on the day of a fatal shooting, and that the probationer intended to, and did in fact exercise control over the sons' access to one of the guns in the minutes leading up to the shooting, the trial court properly found that the probationer had constructive possession of the firearm.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-60" target="_self">42-8-60</a></cite> et seq., in an effort to show witness bias, the trial court erred in requiring the defendant to introduce into evidence certified copies of the relevant sentencing record and in thus denying the defendant the right to open and conclude closing arguments by forcing the defendant to present evidence as the defendant had a right under the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const., amend. VI to cross-examine the witness regarding the witness's first offender probation status to show bias, but the records relevant to that status were not admissible because there was no adjudication of the witness's guilt; the error, however, was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt. Smith v. State, <cite class="ga_court">276 Ga. 263</cite>, <cite class="app_court">577 S.E.2d 548</cite> (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in prohibiting the defendant's cross-examination of a witness regarding the witness's first offender plea in order to show bias and a motive to testimony favorable to the state because there was no evidence showing the connection between the witness's first offender status and the witness's desire to shade the witness's testimony to curry favor with the state; the defendant had to present facts in addition to the existence of two first offender pleas to support the defendant's efforts to impeach the witness for bias.

        <p>
       Since the defendant was informed at the time the defendant was originally placed on probation that the defendant could receive full sentence upon violation of the defendant's probation, the court, in revoking the defendant's probation, did not lack authority to impose a 10-year sentence on the ground that the first-offender sentencing document entered by the court imposed only five years. Griffin v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">163 Ga. App. 871</cite>, <cite class="app_court">295 S.E.2d 863</cite> (1982).

       When the defendant's sentence under paragraph (a)(1) was five years' probation, with the requirement that 90 to 120 days be served in a probation boot camp, later modified to a probation detention center, when the defendant's probation was revoked, the trial court could have sentenced the defendant to the maximum penalty for the burglary conviction.

       After the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation, the court could not impose the maximum sentence without giving the defendant credit for time served on probation, since to do so would impose a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed by law.

       In the case of defendant who was convicted and sentenced for child molestation, a resentencing order requiring defendant to serve a total of 13 years - five to be served in prison beyond the three already served on probation, to be followed by an additional five years on probation - was not error because defendant was resentenced within the maximum sentence allowable by law, defendant was clearly advised of this possibility, and the court credited the time already served on probation.

       - Trial court does not err in imposing a greater sentence on defendant than the original first offender sentence, in revoking defendant's earlier probation, when the first offender sentence of probation plainly stated, "If such probation is revoked or cancelled, the court may adjudge the defendant guilty of the above offense and impose any sentence permitted by law for the . . . offense."

        Sentence vacated and resentencing ordered
       
       when the trial court erred by increasing a juvenile defendant's voluntary manslaughter sentence after the defendant had already begun serving the sentence, because the original sentence was final at the time the sentence was imposed, and the defendant had no reason to believe otherwise; hence, the trial court's increased sentence constituted double jeopardy and could not stand.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court's 1998 sentencing order denying defendant exoneration and discharge was void as a matter of law because the state never filed a motion for revocation; thus, exoneration and discharge was automatic under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-60ol1e" target="_self">42-8-60(e)</a></cite>, (g), and (h), and the defendant's motion to correct a void sentence was improperly denied. Collins v.

       </p>

        <p>

        Double jeopardy concerns did not prohibit resentencing after original sentence had begun
       
       being served if the resentencing was allowed by law and the defendant had no reasonable expectation in the finality of the original sentence; resentencing after a defendant had begun serving the original sentence was allowed under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-60" target="_self">42-8-60</a></cite> et seq., because the defendant initially lied to the trial court about a prior conviction to receive first offender treatment, and since the defendant was warned by the trial court that the defendant was subject to resentencing if the defendant was untruthful about the defendant's record, the defendant had no reasonable expectation that the original sentence was final.

       - Trial court did not err in increasing the sentence originally imposed upon the defendant because the defendant was informed when the first offender probation sentence was pronounced that, upon an adjudication of guilt, the defendant could be sentenced to the maximum allowable under the law; although the sentencing form was ambiguous since both the first offender treatment box and the felony sentence box were checked, the ambiguity in the form was not fatal to the trial court's imposition of a sentence greater than the original one.

Because the trial court had neither revoked the inmate's first-offender status nor entered an adjudication of guilt, the inmate was discharged upon the inmate's release from confinement in May 2001, and the clerk's records incorrectly represented that the inmate was discharged in December 2014 reflecting when the trial court's order was dated and filed.

       Trial court did not err in allowing the state to impeach the defendant's girlfriend using the girlfriend's first-offender plea because the state did not use the girlfriend's guilty plea to impeach the girlfriend's general credibility, but instead used it to show bias through evidence that the defendant had previously attempted to accept responsibility for the girlfriend's criminal conduct in a different matter, and the trial court acted well within the court's discretion in allowing the state to explore whether the defendant's previous attempt to accept responsibility for the girlfriend's criminal conduct might have influenced the girlfriend's trial testimony.

        <p>
       - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's petition to seal records pursuant to the statute limiting public access to first offender records as the defendant's guilty plea to repeated violations of public trust in connection with the defendant's dental profession authorized the trial court to be inclined toward allowing the record to be available to the public. Austin v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">343 Ga. App. 118</cite>, <cite class="app_court">807 S.E.2d 1</cite> (2017), cert. denied, 2018 Ga. LEXIS 341 (Ga. 2018).

        <p>
       Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for an order of exoneration and to restrict access to the defendant's criminal record because the sentencing form was not ambiguous as the form merely established that the defendant was either being adjudged guilty or sentenced as a first offender, not both, and the form indicated, in bold print, that the disposition of the charged offense was guilty; thus, the sentencing form clearly indicated that the defendant was convicted of the charged offense.

   §
   3-1/HB 310, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "(a)
   The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1)
   The authorization for county and municipal probation offices and private probation services was enacted to provide cost savings to the state by using state probation services for felony offenders and utilizing county and municipal probation offices and private probation entities which contract with courts for the supervision of misdemeanor and county and city ordinance offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2)
   In enacting such legislation, the General Assembly intended to authorize judges to use county and municipal probation offices and private probation services providers to supervise misdemeanor and county and city ordinance offenders in the same manner as the judges of the superior courts use state probation services as a means of supervising felony offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3)
   The General Assembly did not intend to restrict the powers of judges to impose, suspend, toll, revoke, or otherwise manage the probation of misdemeanor and county and city ordinance offenders sentenced in such courts when utilizing county and municipal probation offices and private probation services providers; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4)
   The General Assembly intended that county and municipal probation officers and private probation officers, when acting in performance of their official duties in supervising probationers in accordance with law and the orders of a court, would have the same rights, authority, and protections as state probation supervisors.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b)
   It is the intention of the General Assembly to improve the use and provision of probation services by courts for misdemeanor and ordinance violations by enacting this part."

        Requirement for payment of probation supervision fees by probationers to private probation services company did not violate the separation of powers since the imposition of the fees pursuant to contract constituted a civil fee for services, not a criminal punishment. Furthermore, the mere act of privatizing probation services did not violate the Georgia Constitution since a probation services company was not authorized to deprive probationers of property or liberty without due process, the private probation services were not fundamentally unfair, and the sentencing court continued to oversee the probation process.

       The 2012 amendment,
      </b>
      effective January 1, 2013, substituted the present provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the former provisions, which read: "(a) In any case where the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation on a resident of this state whose driving privilege is not suspended or revoked, the court shall require the person to surrender his or her driver's license to the court immediately and provide proof of compliance with such order to the court or the probation officer and obtain an ignition interlock device restricted driving license within 30 days. Upon expiration of the period of time for which such person is required to use an ignition interlock device, the person may apply for and receive a regular driver's license upon payment of the fee provided for in Code Section 40-5-25. If such person fails to provide proof of installation to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 and receipt of the restricted driving license within such period, absent a finding by the court of good cause for that failure, which finding is entered in the court's record, the court shall revoke or terminate the probation.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b)(1) In any case where the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation on a resident of this state whose driving privilege is suspended or revoked, the court shall require the person to provide proof of compliance with such order to the court or the probation officer and the Department of Driver Services not later than ten days after the date on which such person first becomes eligible to apply for an ignition interlock device limited driving permit in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or a habitual violator's probationary license in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection, whichever is applicable. If such person fails to provide proof of installation to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 within the period required by this subsection, absent a finding by the court of good cause for that failure, which finding is entered on the court's record, the court shall revoke or terminate the probation if such is still applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) If the person subject to court ordered use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation is authorized under Code Section 40-5-63 or 40-5-67.2 to apply for reinstatement of his or her driver's license during the period of suspension, such person shall, prior to applying for reinstatement of the license, have an ignition interlock device installed and shall maintain such ignition interlock device in a motor vehicle or vehicles to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 for a period of six months running concurrently with that of an ignition interlock device limited driving permit, which permit shall not be issued until such person submits to the department proof of completion of a DUI Alcohol or Drug Use Risk Reduction Program, proof of having undergone any clinical evaluation and of having enrolled in any substance abuse treatment program required by Code Section 40-5-63.1, and proof of installation of an ignition interlock device on a vehicle or vehicles to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111. Such a person may apply for and be issued an ignition interlock device limited driving permit at the end of 12 months after the suspension of the driver's license. At the expiration of such six-month ignition interlock device limited driving permit, the driver may, if otherwise qualified, apply for reinstatement of a regular driver's license upon payment of the fee provided in Code Section 40-5-25.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) If the person subject to court ordered use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation is authorized under Code Section 40-5-58 or under Code Section 40-5-67.2 to obtain a habitual violator's probationary license, such person shall, if such person is a habitual violator as a result of two or more convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, have an ignition interlock device installed and maintained in a motor vehicle or vehicles to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 for a period of six months following issuance of the probationary license, and such person shall not during such six-month period drive any motor vehicle that is not so equipped, all as conditions of such probationary license. Following expiration of such six-month period with no violation of the conditions of the probationary license, the person may apply for a habitual violator probationary license without such ignition interlock device condition.

       - There is nothing in the statutory provisions, defining powers and duties of members of State Board of Pardons and Paroles, which provides that doing certain acts by a member would operate as a forfeiture of the member's office. Turner v. Wilburn, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 149</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E.2d 285</cite> (1949). (But see O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       There being no statutory provision that a member of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles should forfeit the member's office if the member engaged in any other business or profession, or held any public office, during the member's service upon the board, quo warranto is not the proper remedy to determine whether or not there has been an act of forfeiture.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - Management and control is vested in State Board of Pardons and Paroles and not in individual members, or in any one individual officer. In the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, when official authority is conferred upon the board or commission composed of three or more persons, such authority may be exercised by a majority of the members of the board, but it may not be exercised by a single member of such a board, or by a minority. 1945-47 Op.

       <p>
        - Chair of the board is the proper parliamentary officer to preside at meetings of the board for the purpose of directing or regulating proceedings and seeing that meetings or hearings are conducted in an orderly manner. The chair of the board, however, by virtue of such office or of the chair's title, does not acquire authority to perform the powers and duties vested by the General Assembly in the State Board of Pardons and Paroles. 1945-47 Op.

        - Except for supervision of parolees and assignment to the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) for administrative purposes only, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles retains the board's quasi-judicial functions and powers as a result of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1972 (Ga.

       challenging procedures used by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles when the Board revoked the inmate's parole because the recommendation submitted by the Board member who heard the allegations was not a part of the record and there was no evidence in the record which allowed the court to determine the basis of absent Board members' decisions to accept that recommendation and what procedures were followed in revoking the inmate's parole.

       Trial court did not err in denying parolee's petition for writ of mandamus to lift parole conditions requiring electronic monitoring and that the parolee get sex offender counseling as the electronic monitoring condition had been lifted by the time the trial court held a hearing on that condition and the parole board did not act in an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable manner in imposing the counseling condition as the parolee's offenses, while they were not sexually violent offenses, had sexual overtones; thus, the parole board acted consistent with the board's primary goal of protecting society.

   "The General Assembly declares and finds: (1) That the 'Sentence Reform Act of 1994,' approved April 20, 1994 (Ga.

      , <cite class="ga_app_court">225 Ga. App. 509</cite> (1997), the Georgia Court of Appeals held, notwithstanding the 'Sentence Reform Act of 1994,' that the provisions of the First Offender Act would still be available to the sentencing court, which would mean that a person who committed a serious violent felony could be sentenced to less than the minimum mandatory ten-year sentence; and (3) That, contrary to the decision in
      <i>
       State v. Allmond
      </i>
      , it is the expressed intent of the General Assembly that persons who commit a serious violent felony specified in the 'Sentence Reform Act of 1994' shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of imprisonment of not less than ten years and shall not be eligible for first offender treatment."

       Even though the State Pardons and Paroles Board was required to adopt a parole guideline system on all inmates who would become eligible for parole, except for inmates serving life sentences, the board was not obligated to grant parole to a prisoner at the earliest date parole had to be considered as the issue of whether to grant parole was a discretionary matter entrusted to the board; thus, the prisoner's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel parole at an earlier time should have been denied.

       <p>
        - Parole board was responsible for maintaining a complete record on any person who came under the power of the board and that record included the nature and term of the individual's sentence; furthermore, it was the parole board that has the power to set the terms and conditions of parole. Thus, the acts of the parole officer, or those within the parole board who make such determinations, in setting the expiration dates of plaintiff's parole, served to break the chain of causation with respect to any error that might have flowed from the misstatement in the parole officer's motion; the parole officer had no power to increase plaintiff's sentence and no power to set the terms of plaintiff's parole.

        - Presence of "unfettered discretion" in the clemency process does not render the imposition of the death penalty on the defendant arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The discretion involved at the clemency stage can never cause the imposition of the death sentence; it serves only as an act of grace to relieve that sentence even when the sentence has been legally imposed.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c09s42-9-42" target="_self">42-9-42</a></cite>, does not require the board to grant parole based upon the presence or absence of specified findings and, as a result, does not give rise to a liberty interest. Accordingly, because the plaintiff had no liberty interest in parole, the plaintiff's right to procedural due process could not have been violated and summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim was appropriate.

Although the legislature has required the Board of Pardon and Paroles to adopt a guideline system to be used as a framework for making more consistent parole decisions, it also preserved the Board's authority to use the Board's discretion in making final parole decisions. The statute and regulations, therefore, do not mandate that release be granted if the guidelines criteria is met. Sultenfuss v.

   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its causative agent, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), pose a grave threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. In the absence of any effective vaccination or treatment for this disease, it threatens almost certain death to all who contract it. The disease is largely transmitted through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use, not through casual contact, and, while deadly, is therefore preventable. The key component of the fight against AIDS is education. Through public education and counseling our citizens can learn how the disease is transmitted and, thus, how to protect themselves and prevent its spread. The Department of Human Resources is encouraged to continue its efforts to educate all Georgians about the disease, its causative agent, and its means of transmission. In addition, voluntary testing should be encouraged for anyone who feels at risk of infection. While education, counseling, and voluntary testing are vital to the elimination of this epidemic, other measures are needed to protect the health of our citizens, and it is the intention of the General Assembly to enact such measures in the exercise of its police powers in order to deal with AIDS and HIV infection."

       - Because a prior district court order only required that the inmate be considered for parole annually under the rules in effect at the time of the inmate's offense, and neither the order nor the rule in effect at the time of the inmate's offense required interviews, the members of Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles complied with the order; and, while the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit included interviews in the list of actions encompassed by "parole reconsideration hearing," the Eleventh Circuit did not hold that an in-person interview was mandated, and O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        - Parole board was responsible for maintaining a complete record on any person who came under the power of the board and that record included the nature and term of the individual's sentence; furthermore, it was the parole board that has the power to set the terms and conditions of parole. Thus, the acts of the parole officer, or those within the parole board who make such determinations, in setting the expiration dates of plaintiff's parole, served to break the chain of causation with respect to any error that might have flowed from the misstatement in the parole officer's motion; the parole officer had no power to increase the plaintiff's sentence and no power to set the terms of the plaintiff's parole.

      After proper documentation is received from the county, the board shall reimburse the county, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the board and in the amount appropriated for this purpose by the General Assembly, for the cost of incarceration of any person who is arrested pursuant to any warrant issued in accordance with Code Section 42-9-48. To the extent that funds are appropriated by the General Assembly for the purpose of reimbursement of medical expenses, the board may reimburse counties for the cost of medical services provided to persons so arrested. The liability of the board for such costs of incarceration shall begin when the person is incarcerated and shall end upon revocation of parole or conditional release of the person. This Code section shall apply only to cases in which the board's warrant is the sole basis for incarceration.

       Whenever a parolee or conditional releasee is arrested on a warrant issued by a member of the board for an alleged violation of parole or conditional release, an informal preliminary hearing in the nature of a court of inquiry shall be held at or near the place of the alleged violation. However, a preliminary hearing is not required if the parolee or conditional releasee is not under arrest on a warrant issued by the board, has absconded from supervision, has signed a waiver of a preliminary hearing, has admitted any alleged violation to any representative of the board in the presence of a third party who is not a representative of the board, or has been convicted of any crime in a federal court or in a court of this state or of another state.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1b">
       The proceeding shall commence within a reasonable time after the arrest of the parolee or conditional releasee. Its purpose shall be to determine whether there is probable cause or reasonable grounds to believe that the arrested parolee or conditional releasee has committed acts which would constitute a violation of his parole or conditional release.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1c">
       The preliminary hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by the board, who shall be some officer who is not directly involved in the case. It shall be the duty of the officer conducting the hearing to make a summary or digest, which may be in the form of a tape recording, of what transpires at the hearing in terms of the testimony and other evidence given in support of or against revocation. In addition, the officer shall state the reasons for his decision that probable cause for revocation does or does not exist and shall indicate the evidence relied upon.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1d">
       It shall be the responsibility of the officer selected to conduct the preliminary hearing to provide the alleged violator with written notice of the time and place of the proceeding, its purpose, and the violations which have been alleged. This notice shall allow a reasonable time for the alleged violator to prepare his case.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1e">
       The officer selected to conduct the preliminary hearing shall have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses resident within the county of the alleged violation after notice of 24 hours. The subpoenas shall be issued without discrimination between public and private parties. When a subpoena is disobeyed, any party may apply to the superior court of the county in which the hearing provided for by this Code section is held for an order requiring obedience. Failure to comply with the order shall be cause for punishment as for contempt of court. The manner of service of subpoenas and costs of securing the attendance of witnesses, including fees and mileage, shall be determined, computed, and assessed in the same manner as is prescribed by law for cases in the superior court.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1f">
       The officer selected to conduct the preliminary hearing shall also have power to issue subpoenas for the production of documents or other written evidence at the hearing provided for by this Code section; but upon written request made promptly and before the hearing, the officer may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive or may condition denial of the request upon the advancement by the person in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost of producing the documents or other written evidence. Enforcement of the subpoenas may be sought in the same manner as is provided in subsection (e) of this Code section for subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1g">
       At the hearing, the alleged violator may appear and speak in his own behalf, may present witnesses to testify in his behalf, and may bring letters, documents, or any other relevant information to the hearing officer. He shall also have the right to cross-examine those who have given adverse information at the preliminary hearing relating to the alleged violation, provided that the hearing officer may refuse to allow such questioning if he determines that the informant would be subjected to risk of harm if his identity were disclosed.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1h">
       Should the hearing officer determine that probable cause for revocation exists, he shall then determine whether the alleged violator should be incarcerated pending his final revocation hearing or whether he should be set free on his personal recognizance pending that hearing. If an alleged violator who is set free on his personal recognizance subsequently fails to appear at his final hearing, the board may summarily revoke his parole or conditional release.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1i">
       The decision of the hearing officer as to probable cause for revocation shall not be binding on the board but may be either ratified or overruled by majority vote of the board. In the event that the board overrules a determination of the hearing officer that probable cause did not exist, the board shall then determine whether the alleged violator should be incarcerated pending his final hearing or whether he should be set free on his personal recognizance pending that hearing. If an alleged violator who is set free on personal recognizance subsequently fails to appear at his final hearing, the board may summarily revoke his parole or conditional release. Where a hearing officer has determined, after finding probable cause, that the alleged violator should be set free on his personal recognizance, the board may overrule that decision and order the alleged violator to be incarcerated pending his final hearing.

         Applicability of double jeopardy clause.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Because parole and probation revocation proceedings are not designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law, and because the purpose of parole and probation revocation proceedings is to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of the parolee's parole or probation, such proceedings are fundamentally distinguishable from juvenile proceedings, the latter being indistinguishable from a criminal prosecution, and, thus, the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const., amend. 5 does not apply to parole and probation revocation proceedings. United States v. Whitney, 649 F.2d 296 (5th Cir. 1981).

       - When a prisoner serving sentence on parole under order of the board is convicted and sentenced to serve time for another criminal offense, the time the prisoner serves on a latter sentence will be computed as time served on the sentence for which the prisoner was paroled, until such time as the board by order revokes the prisoner's parole. Even though warrant is issued for arrest of parolee as parole violator and the parolee arrested, service of the parolee's sentence continues until the board issues an order of revocation and for the parolee's return to prison.

        - Parole, if properly granted in accordance with law and rules and regulations of the board, may be revoked only after a hearing before the board on a specific charge of violating the terms and conditions of parole except in the event the parolee becomes convicted of a crime or enters a plea of guilty to a crime in which case this section provides for revocation by the board without a hearing. However, there need not always be a parole violation before a parole may be revoked. For instance, the authority of a parole board to revoke a parole on the ground that the prisoner had not earned it and was mistakenly granted has been upheld. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-51.

       - Section 1 of Ga. L. 1982, p. 1356 (
   §
   6 of which enacted this Code section) did not amend the Official Code of Georgia Annotated or any prior law. Sections 1 through 5 of the 1982 Act became effective April 14, 1982, but, unlike
   §§
   2 through 5,
   §
   1 did not stand repealed on November 1, 1982; see
   §
   7 of the 1982 Act. Section 1 reads as follows: "The General Assembly recognizes that the number of persons convicted of crimes in the State of Georgia and sentenced to serve terms of imprisonment in the state prison system has increased greatly in recent years; that, under the moral requirements of humane treatment for prisoners, there is a limit to the present capacity of penal institutions comprising the prison system of the State of Georgia; that, because of the limited present capacity of the state penal system, there is a resulting crisis in overcrowding of local jail and detention facilities due to the backlog of convicted persons awaiting transfer to the state prison system; that the delay in time required to construct new state prison facilities in order to increase the capacity of the state prison system would cause little present relief of the crisis of overcrowding which exists in jail and local detention facilities; that there is an uncertainty as to future needs for additional capacity in the state prison system if alternatives to incarceration are adequately developed and utilized after the present crisis has passed; that there is an uncertainty as to the necessity for local governments to build additional bed space in jails and local detention facilities at their own expense to alleviate the present overcrowding crisis if the present state capacity may be better utilized to relieve that crisis; and, finally, that the release of state prison inmates not otherwise eligible for release on parole is necessary to alleviate the overcrowded prison system during a declared emergency. It is the purpose of this Act to authorize the Governor and the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to remedy an emergency with regard to the overcrowding of the state prison system."

      The Governor of this state is authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the State of Georgia with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

     <div>
      <h5>
       "ARTICLE I.
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       PURPOSE.
      </h5>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the By-laws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112(1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no 'right' of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and By-laws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

However, a State Council shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the member state at a specified meeting. The By-laws may provide for Members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone, or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where members are present in person.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
         Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the Rules or as otherwise provided in the Compact.

All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of offenders as directed through its By-laws and Rules which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Article and the By-laws and Rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.S. Section 551, et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C.S. app. 2, Section 1, et seq., as may be amended (hereinafter 'APA').
        </p>
        <p>
         All Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a majority of the legislatures of the Compacting States rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compacting State.
        </p>
        <p>
         When promulgating a Rule, the Interstate Commission shall:
        </p>
        <p>
         Not later than sixty days after a Rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such Rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, as defined in the APA, in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subjects to be addressed within 12 months after the first meeting must at a minimum include:
        </p>
        <p>
         The existing rules governing the operation of the previous compact superceded by this Act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that an emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall oversee the interstate movement of adult offenders in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in Non-compacting States which may significantly affect Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         The courts and executive agencies in each Compacting State shall enforce this Compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compacting State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section B. Dispute Resolution
        </p>
        <p>
         The Compacting States shall report to the Interstate Commission on issues or activities of concern to them, and cooperate with and support the Interstate Commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues which are subject to the Compact and which may arise among Compacting States and Noncompacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall enact a By-law or promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section C. Enforcement
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XII, Section B, of this compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section D. Extradition
        </p>
        <p>
         In accordance with the laws of the United States, the duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the offender to be retaken. All legal requirements to extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such offenders. The decision of the sending state to retake an offender shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; however, if at the time when a state seeks to retake an offender there should be pending against the offender within the receiving state any criminal charge, or if the offender should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the offender shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states that are parties to this compact without interference.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each Compacting State to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each Compacting State and shall promulgate a Rule binding upon all Compacting States which governs said assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its By-laws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than 35 of the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2002, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other Compacting State, upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of Non-member states or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a non-voting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact ('Withdrawing State') by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.
        </p>
        <p>
         The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section B. Default
        </p>
        <p>
         If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted ('Defaulting State') in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the By-laws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
        </p>
        <p>
         The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission By-laws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.
        </p>
        <p>
         Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the state council of such termination.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section C. Judicial Enforcement
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and By-laws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section D. Dissolution of Compact
        </p>
        <p>
         The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the By-laws.
        </p>
        <p>
         The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.
        </p>
        <p>
         The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section A. Other Laws
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         All Compacting States' laws conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section B. Binding Effect of the Compact
        </p>
        <p>
         All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules and By-laws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective."

      </h5>
      <p>
       The party States, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party States to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this Compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.

        Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this Compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending State and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending State, for transfer to another institution in which the sending State may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending State; provided, that the sending State shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under Article III.
       </li>
       <li id="t42c11s42-11-2ol2d">
        Each receiving State shall provide regular reports to each sending State on the inmates of that sending State in institutions pursuant to this Compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending State, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending State and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending State.
       </li>
       <li id="t42c11s42-11-2ol2e">
        All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this Compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with similar inmates of the receiving State as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving State shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending State.
       </li>
       <li id="t42c11s42-11-2ol2f">
        Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this Compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending State may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending State, or of the receiving State if authorized by the sending State. The receiving State shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending State. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving State, the governing law shall be that of the sending State and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending State shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending State. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving State shall act solely as agents of the sending State and no final determination shall be made in any manner except by the appropriate officials of the sending State.

       <li id="t42c11s42-11-2ol2g">
        Any inmate confined pursuant to this Compact shall be released within the territory of the sending State unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving States, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending State shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.

       <li id="t42c11s42-11-2ol2h">
        Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this Compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending State located within such State.

        The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending State to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect to any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this Compact.
        <p>
         Any State party to this Compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this Compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving State pursuant to this Compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving States have made contractual provisions; provided, that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, express consent of the appropriate official of the sending State shall be required therefor.
        </p>
        <p>
         This Compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the States so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two States. Thereafter, this Compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said States upon similar action by such State.
        </p>
        <p>
         This Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party State until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the Compact to the appropriate officials of all other party States. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing State from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing State shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this Compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party State may have with a non-party State for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party State authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any State participating therein, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining States and in full force and effect as to the State affected as to all severable matters.

       RTICLE IV. PROCEDURES AND RIGHTS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a State party to this Compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party State is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party State, the receiving State to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The appropriate officials of any State party to this Contract shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.

      <p>
       STATE; EXTRADITION.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any decision of the sending State in respect to any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this Compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving State, but if at the time the sending State seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving State there is pending against the inmate within such State any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such State a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving State until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending State shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this Compact through any and all States party to this Compact without interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this Compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending State and from the State in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving State the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending State, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly makes the following findings and determinations:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c12s42-12-2ol11">
       The costs of litigation are rising dramatically. It is the responsibility of this body to seek out and adopt measures to rectify this situation. One source of the rise in litigation costs is frivolous prisoner lawsuits. Meritless lawsuits are being filed at an ever-increasing rate by prisoners who view litigation as a recreational exercise. To address the problems caused by the filing of nonmeritorious lawsuits and to relieve some of the burden placed on Georgia cities, counties, state agencies, the courts, and the Department of Corrections, this chapter is enacted.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c12s42-12-2ol12">
       Before filing any sort of civil action, all citizens must evaluate the strengths of their claim in light of their own personal financial situation. Private individuals are forced to balance the strength of their case against the reality of court costs, filing fees, and the potential consequences of filing a frivolous or meritless lawsuit. Georgia's prisoners currently face no such dilemma. In light of the fact that all prisoners' needs are provided at city, county, or state expense, a prisoner cannot claim that his or her financial status or security would be compromised by a requirement to pay court costs and fees. To address this inequity, the General Assembly enacts this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c12s42-12-2ol13">
       In forma pauperis status will continue to allow the filing of an action by a prisoner, thus providing the prisoner with the constitutional right to access to courts. Freezing of the prisoner's inmate account will hold the prisoner responsible for court costs and fees by seizing any future deposits into the account.
