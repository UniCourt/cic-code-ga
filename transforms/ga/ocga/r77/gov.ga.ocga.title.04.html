       - Livestock running at large on a public road are trespassers, and a motorist is liable only for willful and wanton negligence in injuring the animal. Green v. Heard Milling Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 116</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E.2d 408</cite> (1969).

       Since the abolition of the open range by adoption of this section, loose livestock going upon the lands of others, including a railroad right-of-way, are trespassers, and the duty owed them by the landowner or the railroad company is not willfully or wantonly to injure them.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t04c03s4-3-3" target="_self">4-3-3</a></cite>, and summary judgment for owners was proper in a driver's claim arising out of an accident in which the driver struck a cow because, inter alia, the evidence showed that the fencing surrounding the pasture where the cows were kept was in good repair and the gates were closed at the time of the driver's accident; evidence was presented that the fencing was sufficient to confine the cattle, that the owners monitored the fences regularly, and that, after leaving the scene of the accident, one of the owners confirmed that all of the gates were closed and that the fences remained in good condition. The driver did not present any admissible evidence to challenge these claims and accordingly there was no evidence of negligence committed by the owners, but only impermissible speculation. West v.

       - Trial court did not err in finding that a sheriff's deputy was entitled to official immunity after killing an owner's bull while attempting to impound the bull because the deputy's actions were discretionary. To control a potentially dangerous animal pursuant to O.C.G.A.

In the event there is a dispute as to the amount of such costs and expenses, the owner may provide bond, with sufficient sureties to be approved by the sheriff, in an amount to be determined by the sheriff, but not exceeding the fair cash value of such livestock, conditioned to pay such costs and damages. Within ten days thereafter the owner shall institute an action to have the dispute adjudicated by the court or referred to a jury if requested by either party to the action.

      No person shall feed garbage to swine without first applying for and obtaining a license from the Commissioner. There shall be no fee for such license, and it shall be valid until and unless revoked or canceled. The requirement of obtaining a license shall not apply to an individual feeding his own animals garbage from his own household. No license which will permit the feeding of any garbage, as that term is defined in subsection (a) of Code Section 4-4-22, to swine shall be issued to any person who does not meet the qualifications of subsection (c) of Code Section 4-4-22.

      Whenever it is determined by the Commissioner, in cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture, that a contagious or infectious disease should be eradicated, the Commissioner is authorized to take whatever steps are necessary to eradicate the disease.

However, when budget conditions permit or when federal matching funds are available, the Commissioner may participate in the cost of eradication and is authorized to expend such funds as are available.

       - If the Commissioner of Agriculture has authority to issue an order making payment for herds of swine destroyed by cholera but is allowed by statute to destroy swine infected with cholera, without making payment therefor, then an order notifying all owners of garbage-fed swine that hereafter no further payments would be made because of the continued outbreak of cholera, was perfectly legal and one of the rights conferred upon the Commissioner by statute.

      Swine mycobacteriosis poses a serious potential health threat to the people of this state. The swine farmers of this state have experienced and are experiencing serious economic losses due to the condemnation of swine infected with mycobacteriosis under the laws of this state. It is in the best interest of this state to seek the speedy eradication of swine mycobacteriosis in this state, while ensuring a supply of swine meat products in this state, and to provide for indemnification to those persons having swine condemned because such swine are infected with swine mycobacteriosis.

      Methods which can be used for disposal of dead animals are burning, incineration, burial, rendering, or any method using appropriate disposal technology which has been approved by the Commissioner of Agriculture. Disposal of dead animals by any of the approved methods must be completed within 24 hours after death or discovery. Dead animals that are buried must be buried at least three feet below the ground level, have not less than three feet of earth over the carcass, and must not contaminate ground water or surface water.

     <p>
      For the purpose of putting a speedy end to the suffering of hopelessly diseased and disabled animals, any person finding any abandoned domestic animal which is diseased or injured past recovery may apply to any magistrate of the county, who may summarily decide whether such animal should be destroyed, after giving notice to the owner, if known, whenever such notice can be given without defeating the object of this Code section. The order authorizing the destruction of such animal shall not defeat the owner's claim for damages against the person destroying or procuring the destruction of such animal.

The Commissioner is required to consider every such objection and afford the aggrieved party opportunity to submit evidence and argument in support of his protest; and if, in his judgment, the protest is in whole or in part well founded, the Commissioner shall take such corrective measures as are necessary to give the aggrieved party relief in every respect from any illegal or unconstitutional requirement. This Code section is expressly made an administrative remedy and every person affected by any rule, regulation, or act of the Commissioner is required to exhaust this remedy before pursuing any other remedy, provided that nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to deny any applicant for a license any existing right to a review by the court of the Commissioner's action as now provided by law.

        <p>
       - Under the terms of the bond required by Ga. L. 1956, p. 501, which named the Commissioner as trustee, the law obligated the Commissioner when there was a default in its provisions to collect the bond or any necessary part thereof to pay the claim of any person from whom the principal had purchased livestock and failed to pay for the same; or where the aggregate claims of several similarly situated exceeded the amount of the bond to collect it in full and disburse the proceeds pro rata among several claimants.

        <p>
       - Bond dealt with in Ga. L. 1956, p. 501 is purely and strictly a statutory one - a bond which a livestock dealer or broker is required by law to execute and deposit with Georgia's Commissioner of Agriculture before the dealer or broker can obtain a license or permit to deal in livestock. The validity of a bond given in compliance with a statute, and which meets the requirements of the statute is not affected or its nature changed by the inclusion in the bond of a condition that is either unauthorized or is repugnant to the statute.

       If a dog is wrongfully in the place where the dog does the mischief, the owner is liable, irrespective of prior knowledge by the owner of the dog's dangerous proclivities. Kiser v.

        Dog is a domestic animal
       
       and the owner of a domestic animal is liable if such animals are wrongfully in the place where the animal does mischief even if the owner does not have notice. Kiser v. Morris, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 224</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).

       - In an action to recover damages for injuries inflicted upon plaintiff's dog when the dog was attacked by defendant's dog, it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the owner of the dog knew of the dog's propensity to do the particular act which caused injury to the complaining party, since the fight was initiated in the public road and upon an easement adjoining defendant's house and culminated in defendant's front yard, which areas were not considered the "land of another."

      The General Assembly finds that the sale of exotic and pet birds presents a serious potential hazard to the health of livestock and humans due to the potential of transmission of disease by birds. The General Assembly further finds that regulation of bird dealers is a necessary means of minimizing this hazard.

The emergency order shall contain findings to this effect and reasons for the determination. The order shall contain or be accompanied by a notice of opportunity for hearing, which notice may provide that a hearing will be held if and only if a person subject to the order requests a hearing within ten days of the receipt of the order and notice.

Upon such a request for hearing, the Commissioner shall schedule and hold the hearing, unless postponed by mutual consent, within 30 days after receipt by the Commissioner of the request therefor.

      The General Assembly recognizes that persons who participate in equine activities, livestock activities, or llama activities may incur injuries as a result of the risks involved in such activities. The General Assembly also finds that the state and its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from such activities. The General Assembly finds, determines, and declares that this chapter is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly to encourage equine activities, livestock activities, and llama activities by limiting the civil liability of those involved in such activities.

      The General Assembly finds that the breeding of dogs and cats acquired from public or private animal shelters, animal control agencies operated by political subdivisions of this state, humane societies, or public or private animal refuges in the State of Georgia results in the birth of thousands of animals who become strays, suffer privation and death, constitute a public nuisance and health hazard, and, ultimately, are impounded and destroyed at great public expense.It is therefore declared to be the public policy of this state that preventing the breeding of dogs and cats acquired from such shelters, animal control agencies, humane societies, or public or private animal refuges be encouraged.
