       County, which had accepted dedication of a subdivision road in 1962 but had not completed the road or maintained it for 50 years, due to the county's mistaken belief that the road was private, was ordered to complete and maintain the road; the county's failure to complete the road was arbitrary and capricious, given the county's acceptance of subdivision plats requiring the road. As to unopened roads in the subdivision, the roads were not public under O.C.G.A.

        Georgia DOT is an arm of the state
       
       and thus may have immunity under the Eleventh Amendment because any recovery would have been paid out of state funds and the fact that Georgia DOT can allocate the DOT's funds in DOT's own discretion and without intervention by the state legislature does not change the fact that these funds are state funds.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the charge in question does in fact state that the Department of Transportation has "general responsibility to design, manage and improve the state highway system," it seems to capture the essence of the sections the defendant relies upon, which are in fact very broad, general descriptions of the duties of the DOT. The additional material used by the court is drawn from the more specific statutory description of the respective duties of the DOT and municipalities. Thus, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c02s32-2-2" target="_self">32-2-2</a></cite> does indeed mention the general duty of the DOT to "designate, improve, manage, control, construct, and maintain." Banks v. City of Brunswick, 529 F. Supp. 695 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 97 (11th Cir. 1982).

       - Court of equity will not interfere with the discretionary action of the State Highway Department (now Department of Transportation) in locating, grading, or improving a state-aid highway, within the area of their legally designated powers, unless such action is arbitrary and amounts to an abuse of the court's discretion.

        <p>
       - While the word "bridge," as used in former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   748 did not include the public road leading thereto, or a drain or opening thereunder, the statute did include "all the appurtenances necessary to its proper use, and embraces its abutments and approaches and that which is necessary as an approach, to connect the bridge with the highway, is an essential part of the bridge itself." Warren County v. Battle, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 240</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 673</cite> (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>
       In an action against a county for damages from the falling of truck through an opening where a public bridge had been into a ravine below, the petition was not subject to demurrer (now motion to dismiss), and the verdict for the plaintiff was not contrary to law or without evidence to support the verdict, under the defendant's contention that the injury was not caused by reason of a "defective bridge" within the meaning of the statute, but from the entire removal of the bridge, for which the county was not liable, since the petition and the evidence showed that at the time of the injury at least a part of the bridge, i.e., the sills constituting a portion of its "approaches," still remained, and the rest of the bridge was then being repaired.

       - Owner of a bridge franchise is bound to exercise only such care and diligence in the construction of a bridge and keeping the bridge in proper order which every prudent man would exert in relation to the same property in view of the object and purpose for which the bridge was erected and used by the prudent man.

       - While the owner of a private ferry may lawfully charge and collect a toll from persons incidentally crossing thereat, should the owner maintain the ferry for use by the public at large or seek public patronage, or pursue the business of keeping up the ferry for the public, the ferry loses the ferry's character as a private ferry.

I, Sec. III, Para. I); but no support exists for the argument that a waiver of sovereign immunity exists for an ex contractu action against the Department of Transportation which is not predicated upon Ga. Const. 1976, Art. I, Sec. III, Para. I (see Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. III, Para. I). National Distrib. Co. v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga.

       - Department of Transportation is prohibited from maintaining a road after the road is transferred from the state highway system and the department owed no duty to plaintiff who was injured in an accident on the road.

       <p>
        <p>
       When an injured party sued the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) for injuries received in a single-car accident on a county road, the party could not maintain a negligent maintenance claim against DOT because the road on which the accident occurred was not part of the state highway system, nor did the road lead to a state park; thus, under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c04s32-4-41ol11" target="_self">32-4-41(1)</a></cite>, the county was obligated to maintain the road and, under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c02s32-2-61ol1e" target="_self">32-2-61(e)</a></cite>, DOT's contract with the county to improve the road did not relieve the county of this responsibility. Ogles v.

         The department shall evaluate a project to determine, in the judgment of the department, appropriate or desirable levels of state, local, and private participation in financing such project. In making such determination, the department shall be authorized and encouraged to seek the advice and input of the affected local governing authorities, applicable metropolitan planning organizations, and the private financial and construction sectors.

          (1.1) No constitutional officer or member of the State Transportation Board shall serve as an agent, lobbyist, or board member for any entity directly or indirectly under contract with or negotiating a contract with the department under this Code section for one year after leaving his or her position as a constitutional officer or member of the State Transportation Board.

Public notice of such request for proposal shall be made at least 90 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals by posting the legal notice on a single website that shall be procured and maintained for such purposes by the Department of Administrative Services or in substantially the same manner utilized by the department to solicit requests for proposals.

         Upon receipt of a proposal or proposals responsive to the request for proposals, the department shall accept written public comment, solicited in the same manner as provided for notice of proposals, for a period of 30 days beginning at least ten days after the date set for receipt of proposals. In addition, the department shall hold at least one public hearing on such proposals not later than the conclusion of the period for public comment.

         The department shall engage in individual discussions with two or more respondents deemed fully qualified, responsible, and suitable on the basis of initial responses and with emphasis on professional competence and ability to meet the level of private financial participation called for by the department. Repetitive informal interviews shall be permissible. In the event that any local governing authority has agreed to consider financial participation in the project, a representative of such local governing authority, appointed by such local governing authority, may participate in such discussions and interviews. At the discussion stage, the department may discuss estimates of total project costs, including, but not limited to, life cycle costing and nonbinding estimates of price for services. Proprietary information from competing respondents shall not be disclosed to the public or to competitors. At the conclusion of such discussions, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request for proposal and all information developed in the selection process, the department, with the input of any participating local governing authority, shall select in the order of preference two or more respondents whose qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. Negotiations shall then be conducted with two or more respondents and with the participation of the designated representative of any participating local governing authority. Upon approval by the department, the commissioner shall select the respondent for project implementation based upon contract terms that are the most satisfactory and advantageous to the state and to the department based upon a thorough assessment of value and the ability of the final project's characteristics to meet state strategic goals and investment policies as provided for by paragraphs (1) through (10) of subsection (a) of Code Section 32-2-41.1. Before making such selection, the commissioner shall consult with any participating local governing authority or authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms and conditions for multiple awards are included in the request for proposal, the department may award contracts to more than one respondent. Should the department determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one respondent is fully qualified, or that one respondent is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that respondent.

       As used in this Code section, the term "design-build procedure" means a method of contracting under which the department contracts with another party for the party to both design and build the structures, facilities, systems, and other items specified in the contract.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c02s32-2-81ol1b">
       The department may use the design-build procedure for buildings, bridges and approaches, rail corridors, technology deployments, and limited or controlled access projects or projects that may be constructed within existing rights of way where the scope of work can be clearly defined or when a significant savings in project delivery time can be attained.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c02s32-2-81ol1c">
       When the department determines that it is in the best interests of the public, the department may combine any or all of the environmental services, utility relocation services, right of way services, design services, and construction phases of a public road or other transportation purpose project into a single contract using a design-build procedure. Design-build contracts may be advertised and awarded notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Code Section 32-2-61. However, construction activities shall not begin on any portion of such projects until title to the necessary rights of way and easements for the construction of that portion of the project has vested in the state or a local governmental entity and all railroad crossing and utility agreements have been executed.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c02s32-2-81ol1d">

          </li>
          <li id="t32c02s32-2-81ol1d6B">
           From the list of qualified firms as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a technical proposal and a price proposal from each firm from which the department shall select the lowest qualified bidder or, in the event the department uses the best value procurement process, the request for proposal shall specify the requirements necessary for the selection of the best value proposer which shall include, at a minimum, a weighted cost component and a technical component. A proposal shall only be considered nonresponsive if it does not contain all the information and level of detail requested in the request for proposal. A proposal shall not be deemed to be nonresponsive solely on the basis of minor irregularities in the proposal that do not directly affect the ability to fairly evaluate the merits of the proposal. Notwithstanding the requirements of Code Section 36-91-21, under no circumstances shall the department use a "best and final offer" standard in awarding a contract in order to induce one proposer to bid against an offer of another proposer. The department may provide for a stipulated fee to be awarded to the short list of qualified proposers who provide a responsive, successful proposal. In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the department may use any ideas or information contained in the proposals in connection with the contract awarded for the project, or in connection with a subsequent procurement, without obligation to pay any additional compensation to the unsuccessful proposers;

Regardless of the status or disposition of the issue or dispute, the design-builder and the department shall continue to perform their contractual responsibilities. The department shall have the authority to suspend or provide for the suspension of Section 108 of the department's standard specifications pending final resolution of such contract issues and disputes. This paragraph shall not prevent an aggrieved party from seeking judicial review.

       - Where the owners of a tract of land subdivide the tract into lots, record a map or plat showing such lots, with designated streets and a public park, and sell lots with reference to such map or plat, the owners are presumed to have irrevocably dedicated such streets and park for the use of all of the lot owners in the subdivision.

       Governing authority can acquire fee-simple title to a county road only through condemnation or an express grant in a deed or other instrument. When a road is established by dedication and there is no express grant of fee-simple title, an easement results. Northpark Assocs. No. 2 v. Homard Dev.

        <p>
       - In order to recover from a county for a taking, the plaintiff must show that the taking was done for a public purpose of the county; however, nothing appearing to the contrary, the allegation that the county took the property as part of a right of way for a road and street within the municipality and while acting in the conduct of the county's business sufficiently alleged the right of the county to condemn the land in question.

       - It was not error to exclude from evidence a deed offered by the condemnee to show the price the condemnor paid for land located in alleged close proximity to that of the condemnee.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the condemnee introduced evidence to show that, because of the condemnation, the condemnee would be required to expend certain amounts on fences, screening hedges, and grading, and thus would be consequentially damaged, and there was no evidence as to any consequential benefits resulting from the improvement, the evidence did not authorize a charge on consequential benefits.

       - When the state has specifically condemned access rights to a proposed highway, and when the highway will result in a loss of access to part of the condemnee's land, a charge which designates the condemnation of access rights as an element of compensation for the taking and the loss of access as an element of consequential damages, does not authorize a double award for the same thing.

       - In condemnation proceedings, the only issue before the assessors or a jury on appeal is the amount of compensation to be paid, and neither the assessors nor a jury can determine whether the condemnor is proceeding legally; the remedy of the landowners is to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the illegal proceedings. Garden Parks v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 31</cite> (1953) (decided under former Ga. L. 1961, p. 517).

        <p>
       - Affirmative action seeking to set aside judgment in favor of condemnor, and payment of all expenses and damages accrued to the condemnee, are essential to the vacating and setting aside of a judgment for the value of property condemned.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since previous donation by condemnee had no relevance to the determination of the amount of just and adequate compensation for the property taken, references by condemnee's president to that previous donation as having been "forced" and "coerced" implied that condemnor had acted in bad faith; thus, the testimony by condemnee's president was both irrelevant and prejudicial.

       - Jury was authorized to determine that evidence of comparable sales in the area of a landowner's land, even though higher than the landowner's expert's opinion of the market value of the acreage, reasonably established the value of the land, and it could fix the market value of the land higher or lower than that amount asserted by an expert, provided that the jury's verdict was not so disparate as to justify an inference of gross mistake or undue bias; thus, when the evidence supported the jury's award, there was no inference that it was the result of gross mistake or undue bias.

       - Under the common law, a public road may come into existence by prescription. Southern Ry. v. Combs, <cite class="ga_court">124 Ga. 1004</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E. 508</cite> (1906) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

       Since a private road had been blocked and impassable for more than 10 years, there could not have been continuous use of the road for 7 years and, therefore, there could be no prescriptive rights in the road.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When an established dedication is claimed, the acts relied on to establish the dedication must be such as to clearly and satisfactorily indicate a purpose on the part of the owner to abandon the owner's personal dominion over the property and to devote the property to a definite public use. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In order to constitute a dedication of land to public uses, an intention on the part of the owner to abandon the use of the land to the public must be shown by proof of unequivocal and unambiguous words or acts of such owner; the circumstances must be such as to show a clear assent to such dedication. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - While an intention to dedicate need not be shown by an express declaration to that effect, but may be inferred under certain circumstances from an acquiescence by the owner in the use of the owner's property by the public, such acquiescence is in the nature of an estoppel in pais, and implies a knowledge on the part of the owner of the claim by the public to the right to appropriate the owner's property to the public use.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Occasional road-working of property by public authorities, there being no other evidence of maintenance, is not of itself sufficient to create the presumption of an intention to dedicate; the use and maintenance must be of the character and for the length of time sufficient to create a presumptive right of the public therein. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Mere use of one's property by a small portion of the public,
       
       even for an extended period of time, is not sufficient to authorize an inference that the property has been dedicated to a public use, unless it clearly appears that there was an intention to dedicate, and that this dedication was accepted by the public authorities, either in express terms or by implication resulting from the maintenance of a way public in its nature.

         Prescription requires public use for 20 years.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Before a highway can be established by prescription, it must appear that the general public, under a claim of right, and not by mere permission of the owner, used some defined way without interruption or substantial change, for a period of 20 years or more; the use must not only be adverse, but the use must be continuous and uninterrupted, although it is not every slight or occasional use of the land by the owner that will constitute an interruption of the public use. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When there is no other evidence against the owner to support a dedication but the mere fact of such use, so that the right claimed by the public is purely prescriptive, it is essential, to maintain it, that the use or enjoyment should be adverse, that is with a claim of right, and uninterrupted and exclusive for the requisite length of time. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since there was no intention to dedicate, but the public has taken possession of the property of an individual, and used and maintained the property as a highway for a period of 20 years or more, a highway by prescription becomes complete; when there was an intention to dedicate, the maintenance of a way for a less time will bring into existence a completed highway by dedication.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In a condemnation action wherein a county challenged the valuation placed on the landowner's property, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by allowing the admission of four deeds of sale on other properties as direct evidence of the condemned property's value since a proper foundation was laid for the deeds and dissimilarities in the land went to the weight of the evidence of the deeds, not the admissibility of the deeds.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court erred in dismissing the Georgia Department of Transportation's (DOT's) condemnation petition for the department's failure to submit a properly attested affidavit with the department's petition as the condemnees were estopped from challenging the taking of the condemnees' property because the condemnees withdrew the money deposited by DOT in the court registry.

       - Condemnees were entitled to a new trial in a Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) condemnation proceeding; the trial court erred in refusing to allow impeachment of the DOT expert with the disparity between the expert's pretrial estimate of just compensation (JC) and the higher estimate the expert gave at trial as impeachment might have convinced the jury to award JC closer to the higher JC estimate of the condemnees' expert.

       - Although the trial court properly found that Georgia Department of Transportation acted in bad faith in issuing the department's declaration of taking regarding the condemnees' land, the department erred in setting aside, on the condemnees' motion, only the limited access portion of the declarations of taking as the proper remedy was to set aside the declarations of taking in their entirety.

        Association failed to prove that the proposed road was unsafe;

       - Final order and judgment was improperly set aside based on a finding that the property owner was disabled and that, as a result of the owner's status, service of process was improper because the owner's notice of appeal was untimely as the notice was filed approximately four months after the petition for condemnation and declaration; in the notice of appeal, the owner failed to plead defective service; the owner's motion raising the issue of improper service was filed approximately five months after the notice of appeal; the owner's motion should have been made pursuant to a motion to set aside under the condemnation act; and the Civil Practice Act, O.C.G.A.

       - In a condemnation action where the issue was just and adequate compensation, and the condemnees' expert appraiser testified to having previously been employed by another condemning authority to appraise the same property, but the Department of Transportation did not object to the witness at trial, the issue may not be raised on appeal.

       Because a condemnee did not claim lost profits or business losses, the trial court properly limited the condemnee's evidence to the value of the property taken and consequential damages to the remainder; because the jury's valuation was within the range of the evidence, the trial court properly denied the condemnee's motion for a new trial.

       - Because there was no legislative requirement that, in a condemnation proceeding, a party seeking business loss damages had to specifically and separately plead for such in the notice of appeal, in accordance with the consent judgment that the Georgia Department of Transportation was bound by, a lessee's appeal was to proceed to trial on the lessee's claims for business loss, damages to trade fixtures, and relocation expenses.

       - Whether it is appropriate to consolidate two condemnation proceedings depends upon the use of the property, and when the entire property had a common use so as to entitle the landowners to the consequential damages calculated as resulting to the whole of the property rather than to separate parcels, the trial court's order consolidating the two cases was not in error - especially where to allow two different actions to be brought regarding the one property could have resulted in great harm and injustice to the condemnees' substantive rights.

      For purposes of jurisdiction and administration, the public roads of Georgia shall be divided and classified in accordance with the three types of classifications provided in this Code section:

     <ol>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-1ol11">
       STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. The state highway system shall consist of those public roads which on July 1, 1973, are shown by the records of the department to be "state-aid roads," those public roads thereafter designated by the department as part of the state highway system, and all of The Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways within the state;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-1ol12">
       COUNTY ROAD SYSTEMS. Each county road system shall consist of those public roads within that county, including county roads extending into any municipality within the county, which are shown to be part of that county road system by the department records on July 1, 1973, and any subsequent additions to such county road system made by the county;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-1ol13">
       MUNICIPAL STREET SYSTEMS. Each municipal street system shall consist of those public roads within the limits of that municipality which are not in any other classification under this Code section.

The initial alternative tourism routes shall be U.S. Highway 27 and U.S. Highway 441.

       Subject to the appropriation process, the department may within five years of the designation of an alternative tourism route construct within 20 miles of the state line on each end of such route a welcome center.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-41ol11">
       A county shall plan, designate, improve, manage, control, construct, and maintain an adequate county road system and shall have control of and responsibility for all construction, maintenance, or other work related to the county road system. Such work may be accomplished through the use of county forces, including inmate labor, by contract as authorized in paragraph (5) of Code Section 32-4-42, or otherwise as permitted by law. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a county from entering into a contract providing for a municipality to maintain an extension of the county road system within the municipal limits;

      <li id="t32c04s32-4-41ol12">
       A county shall control, administer, and account for funds received for the county road system and activities incident thereto from any source whatsoever, whether federal, state, county, municipal, or any other; and it shall expend such funds for and on behalf of the county in connection with the county road system and for any purpose in connection therewith which may be authorized in this title or by any other law;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-41ol13">
       A county shall inspect and determine the maximum load, weight, and other vehicular dimensions which can be safely transported over each bridge on the county road system and shall post on each bridge and on each approach thereto on the county road a sign containing a legible notice showing such maximum safe limits, each such sign to conform to the department regulations promulgated under authority of Code Section 32-6-50. However, the department is authorized to give technical assistance to counties, when so requested, in carrying out this paragraph. It shall be unlawful for any person to haul, drive, or bring on any bridge any vehicle, load, or weight which in any manner exceeds the maximum limits so ascertained and posted on such bridge; and any person hauling, driving, or otherwise bringing on such bridge any load or weight exceeding the maximum limits so ascertained and posted shall do so at his own risk; and the county shall not be liable for any damages to persons or property that may result therefrom;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-41ol14">
       A county shall keep on file in the office of the county clerk, available for public inspection, the map of the county road system prepared by the department as provided for in subsection (a) of Code Section 32-4-2. In addition to keeping on file a map of the county road system, the county shall notify the department within three months after a county road is added to the local road or street system and shall further notify the department within three months after a local road or street has been abandoned. This notification shall be accompanied by an appropriate digital file, map, or plat depicting the location of the new or abandoned road;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-41ol15">
       A county shall procure the necessary rights of way for public roads of the state highway system within the county in compliance with subsection (e) of Code Section 32-3-3 and Code Section 32-5-25; and

       - In a personal injury action, contractor had no duty to protect the plaintiff from dangerous or defective conditions caused by others; the county, not the contractor, had the obligation to install the signs which the plaintiff claimed were necessary.

        <p>
       When an injured party sued the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) for injuries received in a single-car accident on a county road, the party could not maintain a negligent maintenance claim against DOT because the road on which the accident occurred was not part of the state highway system, nor did the road lead to a state park; thus, under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c04s32-4-41ol11" target="_self">32-4-41(1)</a></cite>, the county was obligated to maintain the road and, under O.C.G.A.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.09.html#t09c06s9-6-20" target="_blank">9-6-20</a></cite> with regard to a property owner seeking to compel a county to maintain roads in a subdivision because while the county had accepted dedication of the streets, the county still was vested with the discretion to decide whether to open
   all of the roads or close any of the roads, and the trial court was required to determine whether the county's decisions were arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable or a gross abuse of discretion as nowhere in the judgment was that standard articulated.

       County, which had accepted dedication of a subdivision road in 1962 but had not completed the road or maintained the road for 50 years, due to the county's mistaken belief that the road was private, was ordered to complete and maintain the road; the county's failure to complete the road was arbitrary and capricious, given the county's acceptance of subdivision plats requiring the road. As to unopened roads in the subdivision, the roads were not public under O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        - Board of education may not use the board's funds for laying out, altering, maintaining, and improving a public, county-maintained road even though school transportation would be facilitated thereby; it is the sole duty and responsibility of the local officials in charge of county matters to lay out, alter, maintain, and improve the road in the manner the officials deem best suited to the needs of the county. 1962 Op.

        - Because the county must maintain roads on the county road system and because public roads are not removed from the system by mere annexation into a municipality where the road lies, the county must continue to maintain roads on the county road system which are in areas annexed into a municipality until the governing authority of the county removes the roads from the county road system by appropriate action. 1976 Op.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The powers of a county with respect to its county road system, unless otherwise expressly limited by law, shall include but not be limited to the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol11">
       A county shall have the authority to negotiate, let, and enter into contracts with any person or any agency, county, or municipality of the state for the construction, maintenance, administration, or operation of any public road or activities incident thereto in such manner and subject to such express limitations as may be provided by Part 2 of this article or any other provision of law. A county shall also have the authority to perform such road work with its own forces or with a combination of its own forces and the work of a contractor, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Chapter 91 of Title 36;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol12">
       A county shall have the authority to accept and use federal and state funds and to do all things necessary, proper, or expedient to achieve compliance with the provisions and requirements of all applicable federal-aid or state-aid acts and programs in connection with the county's public roads. Nothing in this title is intended to conflict with any federal law and, in case of such conflict, such portion as may be in conflict with such federal law is declared of no effect to the extent of the conflict;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol13">
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol13A">
         A county shall have the authority to acquire and dispose of real property or any interest therein for public road purposes, as provided in Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title and in Chapter 7 of this title. In any action to condemn property or interests therein for such purposes, notice thereof shall be signed by the condemning county; and such notice shall be deemed to be the official action of the county in regard to the commencement of such condemnation proceedings. For good cause shown a county, at any time after commencement of condemnation proceedings and prior to final judgment therein, may dismiss its condemnation action, provided that (i) the condemnation proceedings have not been instituted under Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title, and (ii) the condemnor has first paid to the condemnee all expenses and damages accrued to the condemnee up to the date of the filing of the motion for dismissal of the condemnation action.
        </li>
        <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol13B">
         Pursuant to the requirements of Part 2 of this article, a county shall have the power to purchase, borrow, rent, lease, control, manage, receive, and make payment for all personal property, such as equipment, machinery, vehicles, supplies, material, and furniture, which may be needed in the operation of its county road system; to lease, rent, lend, or otherwise transfer temporarily county property used for road purposes, as authorized by law; to sell or otherwise dispose of all personal property owned by the county and used in the operation of the county road system which is unserviceable; and to execute such instruments as may be necessary in connection with the exercise of the powers described in this subparagraph;
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol14">
       A county and its authorized agents and employees may enter upon any lands in the county for the purpose of making such surveys, soundings, drillings, and examinations as the county may deem necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this title; and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass nor shall it be deemed an entry which would constitute a taking in a condemnation proceeding, provided that reasonable notice of such entry shall be given the owner or occupant of such property, such entry shall be done in a reasonable manner with as little inconvenience as possible to the owner or occupant of the property, and the county shall make reimbursement for any actual damages resulting from such entry;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol15">
       A county shall have the authority to employ, discharge, promote, set and pay the salaries and compensation of its personnel, and determine the duties, qualifications, and working conditions for all persons whose services are needed in the construction, maintenance, administration, operation, and development of its county road system; to work inmates maintained in the county correctional institution or inmates hired from the Department of Corrections and maintained by the latter; and to employ or contract with such engineers, surveyors, attorneys, consultants, and all other employees as independent contractors whose services may be required, subject to the limitations of existing law;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol16">
       A county may grant permits and establish reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, renewal, removal, and relocation of pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, poles, towers, traffic and other signals, and other equipment, facilities, or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over, or under the public roads of the county which are a part of the county road system lying outside the corporate limits of a municipality. However, such regulations shall not be more restrictive with respect to utilities affected thereby than are equivalent regulations promulgated by the department with respect to utilities on the state highway system under authority of Code Section 32-6-174. As a condition precedent to the granting of such permits, the county may require application in writing specifically describing the nature, extent, and location of the portion of the utility affected and may also require the applicant to furnish an indemnity bond or other acceptable security conditioned to pay any damages to any part of the county road system or to any member of the public caused by work of the utility performed under authority of such permit. At all times it shall be the duty of the county to ensure that the normal operation of the utility does not interfere with the use of the county road system. The county may also order the removal or discontinuance of the utility, equipment, facility, or appliances where such removal and relocation are made necessary by the construction or maintenance of any part of the county road system lying outside the corporate limits of a municipality. In so ordering the removal and relocation of a utility or in performing such work itself, the county shall conform to the procedure set forth for the department in Code Sections 32-6-171 and 32-6-173, except that when the removal and relocation have been performed by the county, it shall certify the expenses thereof for collection to its county attorney;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol17">
       A county shall have the power to purchase supplies for county road system purposes through the state as authorized by Code Sections 50-5-100 through 50-5-102;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol18">
       In addition to any taxes authorized by Article 4 of Chapter 5 of Title 48 to be levied and collected for the construction and maintenance of its county road system and activities incident thereto, a county is authorized to levy and collect any millage as may be necessary for such purposes;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol19">
       A county may provide for surveys, maps, specifications, and other things necessary in designating, supervising, locating, abandoning, relocating, improving, constructing, or maintaining the county road system, or any part thereof, or any activities incident thereto or necessary in doing such other work on public roads as the county may be given responsibility for or control of by law;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol110">
       In addition to the powers specifically delegated to it in this title and except as otherwise provided by Code Section 12-6-24, a county shall have the authority to adopt and enforce rules, regulations, or ordinances; to require permits; and to perform all other acts which are necessary, proper, or incidental to the efficient operation and development of the county road system; and this title shall be liberally construed to that end. Any power vested in or duty placed on a county but not implemented by specific provisions for the exercise thereof may be executed and carried out by a county in a reasonable manner subject to such limitations as may be provided by law;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol111">
       In all counties of this state having a population of 550,000 or more according to the United States decennial census of 1970 or any future such census, the county governing authority shall be empowered by ordinance or resolution to assess against any property the cost of reopening, repairing, or cleaning up from any public way, street, road, right of way, or highway any debris, dirt, sediment, soil, trash, building materials, and other physical materials originating on such property as a result of any private construction activity carried on by any developer, contractor, subcontractor, or owner of such property. Any assessment authorized under this paragraph, the interest thereon, and the expense of collection shall be a lien against the property so assessed coequal with the lien of other taxes and shall be enforced in the same manner as are state and county ad valorem property taxes by issuance of a fi. fa. and levy and sale as set forth in Title 48, known as the "Georgia Public Revenue Code"; and
      </li>

       Municipalities whose incorporating Acts became of full force and effect on or after May 1, 2017, but prior to January 1, 2019, shall not establish or maintain restrictions on access by commercial motor vehicles as defined in paragraph (8.1) of Code Section 40-1-1 to portions of the road system providing access to commercial driveways as defined in Code Section 32-6-130, except as to the applicable road system, exceeding any county restrictions in effect on such portions on the date of incorporation unless such county by ordinance or resolution concurs on such restriction.

       County had authority to grant permits and establish reasonable regulations for the installation of pipes, conduits, cables, and wires on the county's public roads; thus, the county had the "necessarily implied authority" to charge companies, such as the telecommunication company, a permit fee for the company's application to use the county's public rights-of-way. Accordingly, the county had the authority to enforce the county's ordinance imposing that fee and furthermore the telecommunication company did not show that the ordinance was unconstitutional.

       - Word "bridge" in this section, which gives a right of action against a county for defective construction, means a bridge used as an instrumentality for travel along a highway and for crossing streams or ravines.

       - Term "bridge" includes all the appurtenances necessary to the bridge's proper use, and embraces the bridge's abutments and approaches; that which is necessary as an approach, to connect the bridge with the highway, is an essential part of the bridge itself. Howington v. Madison County, <cite class="ga_court">126 Ga. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E. 941</cite> (1906); Berrien County v. Vickers, <cite class="ga_app_court">73 Ga.

       - Contiguous embankment necessary to make access to a bridge, so as to pass teams and wagons over the bridge, is a part of the bridge, and title to the bridge covers such an embankment; but if the embankment is not a necessary part of the bridge, but a part of the streets of the municipality, the town, and not the county, would be bound to keep the bridge in repair.

       - Defect in a bridge, which serves as the basis for liability by a county for injuries received by reason thereof, includes any condition of the bridge which renders the bridge unsafe for travelers passing over the bridge. Havird v. Richmond County, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 580</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 220</cite> (1933).

       - When in action against a county for damages from the falling of a truck through an opening where a public bridge had been, into a ravine below, the petition was not demurrable (now motion to dismiss), and the verdict for the plaintiff was not contrary to law or without evidence to support the verdict since the petition and the evidence showed that at the time of the injury at least a part of the bridge, i.e., the sills constituting a portion of its "approaches," still remained, and the rest of the bridge was being repaired. Warren County v. Battle, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 240</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 673</cite> (1934).

       - When the county, or State Highway Department (now Department of Transportation) negligently leaves road machinery on the abutment or approach to a bridge which causes injuries to a person undertaking to cross the bridge in an automobile, such dangerous condition in the bridge is a defect in the bridge, which makes a county liable for injuries caused by a defective bridge.

        County authorities are bound to exercise ordinary care;

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - For a county to be liable for injuries resulting from defective bridge repairs there must have been a failure to take a bond from a contractor when such a bond was required, and the injury complained of must have occurred within the time which would have been covered by the contractor's bond, if such a bond had been given.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since a public bridge was constructed under contract with the authorities of one county across a stream dividing that county from another (the authorities of the latter refusing to participate therein), it was the duty of the county authorities causing the construction of such bridge to take bond in accordance with this section. Cook v. County of DeKalb, <cite class="ga_court">95 Ga. 218</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E. 151</cite> (1894). See also Laurens County v. McLendon, <cite class="ga_app_court">19 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Liability of the contractor is to keep the bridge in good repair for seven years, whether a bond is given for that purpose or not and the liability of the county does not extend beyond that. Monroe County v. Flint, <cite class="ga_court">80 Ga. 489</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E. 173</cite> (1888).

       <p>
        <p>
       - After a county let out the contract for building a bridge to the lowest bidder, but took no bond from the contractor, and the injury complained of occurred ten years after the time of building the bridge, there was no legal liability on the part of the county because of such injury. Monroe County v. Flint, <cite class="ga_court">80 Ga. 489</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E. 173</cite> (1888).

        <p>
       - Liability for defects in a county-line bridge attaches only for failure of the county to take a sufficient bond from the contractor. Thus, since the petition showed that such a bridge was rebuilt by the county without a contract, and without taking a bond, no liability for injuries caused by defects in such a bridge attached against the county.

For good cause shown, a municipality, at any time after commencement of condemnation proceedings and prior to final judgment therein, may dismiss its condemnation action, provided that (A) the condemnation proceedings have not been instituted under Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title and (B) the condemnor has first paid to the condemnee all expenses and damages accrued to the condemnee up to the date of the filing of the motion for dismissal of the condemnation action;

However, reasonable notice shall be given the owner or occupant of the property to be entered; such entry shall be done in a reasonable manner with as little inconvenience as possible to the owner or occupant of the property; and the municipality shall make reimbursement for any actual damages resulting from such entry;

Any municipality may regulate the parking of vehicles on any such roads in order to facilitate the flow of traffic and to this end may require and place parking meters on or immediately adjacent to any or all of such roads for the purpose of authorizing timed parking in designated spaces upon the payment of a charge for such privilege.

However, such regulations shall not be more restrictive with respect to utilities affected thereby than are equivalent regulations promulgated by the department with respect to utilities on the state highway system under authority of Code Section 32-6-174. As a condition precedent to the granting of such permits, the municipality may require application in writing specifically describing the nature, extent, and location of the portion of the utility affected. The municipality may also require the applicant to furnish an indemnity bond or other acceptable security conditioned to pay for any damage to any part of a public road or to any member of the public caused by the work of the utility performed under authority of such permit. However, it shall be the duty of the municipality to ensure that the normal operation of the utility does not interfere with the use of any portion of the municipal street system or of a municipal extension of a county public road. The municipality may also order the removal and relocation of the utility, equipment, facilities, or appliances where such removal and relocation is made necessary by the construction and maintenance of any part of the municipal street system or municipal extension of a county public road. In so ordering the removal and relocation of a utility or in performing such work itself, the municipality shall conform to the procedure set forth for the department in Code Sections 32-6-171 and 32-6-173, except that when the removal and relocation have been performed by the municipality, it shall certify the expenses thereof for collection to its city attorney; and

       - Insofar as charter provisions relieve a city from liability for negligence in the maintenance of the city's streets, such provision is inconsistent with general law in this state, and the inhibition contained in Ga. Const. 1945, Art. I, Sec. IV, Para. I (see Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec. VI, Para. IV) against the passage of special laws conflicting with existing general law precluded raising such charter provisions as a defense to a personal injury action against the city. City of Macon v.

City of East Point v. Christian, <cite class="ga_app_court">40 Ga. App. 633</cite>, <cite class="app_court">151 S.E. 42</cite> (1929); City of Silvertown v.

       Municipalities generally have a ministerial duty to keep their streets in repair, and municipalities are liable for injuries resulting from defects after actual notice, or after the defect has existed for a sufficient time to infer notice.

       - Trial court erred by granting a city summary judgment in a pedestrian's negligence suit seeking damages for a slip and fall on uneven sidewalk pavers because the evidence showed that the uneven and defective condition existed at least seven months prior to the fall; thus, a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether the city had constructive notice.

City of Vidalia v. Brown, <cite class="ga_app_court">237 Ga. App. 831</cite>, <cite class="app_court">516 S.E.2d 851</cite> (1999).

       City was relieved of liability for the injuries sustained by the injured parties when the parties were hit by a motor vehicle at an intersection that was dark due to a loose hinge on a streetlight, under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c04s32-4-93ol1a" target="_self">32-4-93(a)</a></cite>, as the city did not have actual notice of the problem, and the problem had not existed for any appreciable length of time so as to give the city constructive notice of the problem.

       <p>
        <p>
       In a case in which the plaintiff fell over an 18-foot retaining wall, which had no barrier on top, the trial court erred in denying the city's motion for directed verdict because there was no evidence showing the retaining wall was part of the physical road on which the general public traveled; the testimony showed that the retaining wall itself was not a sidewalk, and the expert admitted that there was no path along the side of the retaining wall for public use; and there was no evidence that the city intended for the area near the retaining wall to be used by the public.

       - Trial court did not err by dismissing a pedestrian's slip and fall claims against a city because there was no evidence that the city owned any part of the sidewalk and no evidence that the city performed any maintenance, repairs, or renovations to the sidewalk; thus, the pedestrian presented no evidence to support the contention that the city had or breached a duty to maintain the sidewalk.

       - Municipal corporation is liable for defects which are gradually brought about by the forces of nature, and for defects or obstructions created in or placed on a public street by strangers which render such street unsafe for normal travel, where the municipality had notice of such defect or obstruction and failed to exercise ordinary care in remedying or removing the defect or obstruction, or where the defect or obstruction had existed for a sufficient length of time, and when taken in connection with the nature of the defect or obstruction, it could be reasonably said that the city should have known, and had reasonable time to repair or remove the defect or obstruction.

       - If the question is whether a city has performed the city's duty in regard to keeping a street in a reasonably safe condition, or whether the city has been negligent in that regard, and in respect to failing to erect proper safeguards or to placing proper lights at a dangerous place where an injury occurs, the character of the light at that point, or the light's absence, may be shown as a circumstance bearing on the question of negligence.

       Whether a defect or hole in a city street gave a right of action to a person injured thereby is ordinarily a question for the jury, because it is a complicated question of fact, involving the depth of the hole or defect, the defect's appearance to travelers on the street, and the danger which might have been anticipated and guarded against by the city in the exercise of reasonable forethought. Mayor of Buford v. Medley, <cite class="ga_app_court">58 Ga. App. 48</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 494</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When it appears that a city has permitted an excavation in a street, it becomes a question for the jury to determine as to the extent and character of the warnings or signals placed which are necessary and sufficient to give notice to members of the public using such street of the presence of such excavation or obstruction. City of Rome v. Alexander, <cite class="ga_app_court">63 Ga. App. 301</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 52</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While it is true that a city would not be liable for the existence of a latent defect not discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care, whether the defect was such as the municipality should have discovered the defect in the exercise of ordinary care in keeping the streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition is a question for the jury. City of Bainbridge v. Cox, <cite class="ga_app_court">83 Ga. App. 453</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 192</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a wrongful death case, the trial court properly denied a city summary judgment on the plaintiffs' negligence and nuisance claims based on the obstruction in the line of sight caused by a tree as a jury had to determine whether the tree located on the city's right of way obstructed the view of oncoming traffic such that the tree was a defect within the meaning of O.C.G.A.

Costs incurred for traffic management may include, but not be limited to, costs incurred for flagging, signing, or provision of detours, provided that these activities are directly caused by the obstruction, encroachment, or injury to the public road system.

        <p>
       It is constitutionally permissible for the state to enact a statute providing that any person who operates an overweight motor vehicle on the public roads shall be conclusively presumed to have damaged the roads, and requiring such person to recompense the state for such damage in accordance with a schedule pegging the amount of the damages to the poundage of excess weight.

       <p>
        <p>

        No opportunity to prove damages.
       
       There is certainly no constitutional requirement that the person accused of operating an overweight vehicle be given an opportunity to avoid the penalty or fine by proving that no perceptible damage to the roads in fact occurred in the driver's case.

       - When the charge in question does in fact state that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has "general responsibility to design, manage and improve the state highway system," it seems to capture the essence of the sections the defendant relies upon, which are in fact very broad, general descriptions of the duties of the DOT. The additional material used by the court is drawn from the more specific statutory description of the respective duties of the DOT and municipalities. Thus, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c02s32-2-2" target="_self">32-2-2</a></cite> does indeed mention the general duty of the DOT to "designate, improve, manage, control, construct, and maintain." Banks v. City of Brunswick, 529 F. Supp. 695 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 97 (11th Cir. 1982).

       Trial court erred by denying the railroad's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claims based on inadequate signage at the railroad crossing and the decision to reopen the roadway because it was the Georgia Department of Transportation's responsibility to designate the location for, and the manner of placement of, the traffic control devices and signage.

       - Once a general contractor completes the work on a public road called for under a contract with the Department of Transportation (DOT), the DOT is responsible for traffic-control devices on the road. Baker v. Reynolds Trucking Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">181 Ga. App. 242</cite>, <cite class="app_court">351 S.E.2d 657</cite> (1986).

        <p>
       When the trial court correctly interpreted contract provisions as only requiring the defendant to install traffic control devices, or to take preventative or corrective action when traffic related problems were caused from preexisting hazards or by the defendant's construction activities, the defendant did not undertake to perform the duties under O.C.G.A.

       Contractors were not liable for negligently controlling traffic as the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) was required to place and maintain, or cause to be placed and maintained, traffic control devices and the DOT was responsible for approving all traffic control plans before implementation by a contractor; the injured party failed to show that the contractor failed to implement the traffic control devices pursuant to the DOT's directives, even though the injured party's accident reconstruction expert and drivers involved in the accident found the traffic control measures inadequate or improper.

       - When the charge in question does in fact state that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has "general responsibility to design, manage and improve the state highway system," it seems to capture the essence of the sections the defendant relies upon, which are in fact very broad, general descriptions of the duties of the DOT. The additional material used by the court is drawn from the more specific statutory description of the respective duties of the DOT and municipalities. Thus, O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Town was entitled to summary judgment in a survivor's action claiming damages from the survivor's decedent's fatal collision with a train because the allegedly vision-obstructing vegetation was located on the railroad's property, and, further, it was undisputed that the survivor failed to show that the vegetation was planted or maintained in violation of any statute, code, or local ordinance. Furthermore, although railroads could be liable under common law negligence principles, the failure to maintain a railroad right of way was addressed by the Georgia Code of Public Transportation, specifically by O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Genuine issue of material fact existed about whether there was an absence of governmental authorization for vegetation that allegedly obscured the decedent's view as the decedent drove a tractor-trailer across the town's railroad crossing and was struck by the railway's train and that issue precluded the appellate court's ruling that reversed the trial court's summary judgment to the town and the railway. Fortner v. Town of Register, <cite class="ga_court">278 Ga. 625</cite>, <cite class="app_court">604 S.E.2d 175</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Town was not entitled to summary judgment on a decedent's nuisance claim as correspondence between the town and the railway indicated that in the months preceding a train-truck accident, the defendants were aware that the overgrown shrubbery needed to be cut back to prevent interference with the line of sight at a railroad crossing; further, photographs were also submitted from which a jury might conclude that the shrubs obscured visibility.

       The General Assembly declares it to be the policy of this state that the erection or maintenance of outdoor advertising in areas adjacent to the rights of way of roads of the state highway system, which roads are also a part of the interstate and primary systems of highways within the state, shall be regulated in accordance with the terms of this part and the regulations promulgated by the commissioner pursuant thereto and that all outdoor advertising which does not conform to the requirements of this part is a public nuisance. The General Assembly recognizes that the outdoor advertising industry is a bona fide commercial function. However, in no manner shall any outdoor advertising sign be defined as a commercial or industrial activity or be used for the purposes of administering this part. It is the intention of the General Assembly to provide a statutory basis for the regulation of outdoor advertising, such basis to be consistent with the public policy relating to areas adjacent to roads of the state highway system which also form a part of the interstate and primary systems of highways declared by the Congress in Title 23, Section 103, United States Code.

       Applications for permits authorized by subsections (a) through (d) of Code Section 32-6-79 shall be made to the department upon forms prescribed by the department. The applications shall contain the signature of the applicant and such other information as may be required by the department and shall be verified under oath by the person, firm, or corporation making the application. Permits and renewals thereof shall be issued for and shall be valid only if the sign is erected and maintained in accordance with this part during the 12 month period next following the date of issuance. As to permits for the initial erection of an outdoor advertising sign, one 12 month extension may be granted so long as a written request is submitted to the department at least 30 days prior to expiration along with a fee of $35.00. Any denial of an extension request shall be sent to the applicant before the expiration date and shall state the basis for denial. Multiple extensions shall not be granted as to the same permit, and the applicant shall not be allowed to reapply for the same site until the extension has expired; however, modifications to the application which do not extend the term of the permit shall be allowed. There shall be an initial outdoor advertising permit fee and an annual renewal fee. On and after July 1, 2011, the outdoor advertising application fee shall be $300.00, and the renewal fee for each sign shall be $85.00. The department may adjust future application and renewal fees through the formal rule making process so long as notice of any proposed increase is sent to the House and Senate Transportation Committees at least 30 days prior to final adoption by the department. Such fees shall be limited to amounts sufficient to offset the administrative costs to the department. An annual report on the expenditures and revenues of the department related to the outdoor advertising program shall be sent to the House and Senate Transportation Committees no later than October 31 of each year. Upon receipt of a properly executed application and the appropriate fee for the erection or maintenance of a sign which may be lawfully erected or maintained pursuant to this part, the department shall, within 60 days, issue a permit authorizing the erection or maintenance, or both, of the sign for which application was made except when a person, firm, or corporation is maintaining or allowing the maintenance of an illegal sign as provided for in subsection (f) of Code Section 32-6-79. All outdoor advertising permits and renewals shall expire on the first day of April in the year following issuance. Renewal of such permits shall be made to the department between January 1 and April 1 of each calendar year. Notice of such renewal period shall be mailed to each outdoor advertising permit holder along with an itemized list of all permits maintained by such person or entity in the month of December. In response, each permit holder should clearly indicate any permits not being renewed and return a copy to the department along with payment for all permits being renewed. If a permit holder believes the itemized list is incomplete or inaccurate, such permit holder shall clearly note such discrepancies on the list and return a copy to the department with supporting documentation. The permit holder shall submit the renewal and any suggested corrections within 60 days of the date of the department notice or by April 1, whichever occurs last. If the department fails to receive the renewal before the expiration date, the department shall notify the permit holder by certified mail that the renewal is overdue and shall give the permit holder 45 days from the date of the postmark on such notice to send the department the renewal. If the applicant does not send the permit renewal and fee within 45 days after the postmark date on such notice, the permit shall expire and the sign shall then become an illegal sign. Signs shall become illegal by operation of law after the expiration of the permit followed by notice to the permit holder and a failure to submit for the renewal within 45 days. Any illegal sign may be removed without any administrative proceeding before the department. Vegetation permits or renewals issued pursuant to Code Section 32-6-75.3 shall expire on the first day of September in the year following issuance. If a vegetation permit renewal application and fee is not timely submitted and such deficiency is not cured within 45 days of the postmark date of notice via certified mail from the department, the vegetation permit shall be canceled, but the sign shall not be deemed illegal. No permit shall be renewed if the renewal thereof has not been made in accordance with this Code section.

      <li id="t32c06s32-6-74ol1b">
       Permits shall be transferable. An application to have the permit specified in subsection (a) of this Code section transferred shall be made within 30 days of the change in ownership of the sign; shall be made to the department upon forms prescribed by the department; shall contain the signature of the applicant and such other information as may be required by the department; and shall be verified under oath by the person, firm, or corporation making application for transfer. Failure to comply in a timely and proper manner with this subsection shall be grounds for revocation of the permit.

       - Judgment reversing a decision of the Georgia Department of Transportation overruling an administrative law judge's finding that one owner had a valid multiple message permit for its sign and that a second owner's application for a permit was properly denied was remanded because the superior court ignored the basis for the GDOT's conclusion and reviewed the ALJ's decision instead, and the findings and conclusions of the Deputy Commissioner of the GDOT pertaining to governmental restrictions on commercial speech did not properly address and resolve the issues; in its final agency decision, the Deputy Commissioner essentially sidestepped the issues the ALJ addressed and resolved and did not directly address the issue of whether, applying the applicable provisions and regulations, the first owner failed to make the necessary revisions to its sign, and the GDOT's conclusion that allowing the first owner to keep its permit would be unduly restrictive was arbitrary and capricious.

     <p>
      There is established a special fund to be known as the "Roadside Enhancement and Beautification Fund." This fund shall consist of all moneys collected under Code Section 32-6-75.3, any appropriations by the General Assembly to the fund, revenues derived from the sale of any special and distinctive wildflower motor vehicle license plates issued pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection (l) of Code Section 40-2-86, any contributions to the fund from any other source, and all interest thereon. All moneys collected under Code Section 32-6-75.3 and fees for any special and distinctive wildflower motor vehicle license plates shall be paid into the fund. All balances in the fund shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account identifying the fund and shall be carried forward each year so that no part thereof may be deposited in the general treasury. The department shall administer the fund and expend moneys held in the fund in furtherance of roadside enhancement and beautification projects along public roads in this state and administration of the tree and vegetation trimming permit program under Code Section 32-6-75.3. In addition to the foregoing, the department may, without limitation, promote and solicit voluntary contributions, promote the sale of motor vehicle license tags authorized under paragraph (5) of subsection (l) of Code Section 40-2-86, and develop any fund raising or other promotional techniques deemed appropriate by the department. Contributions to the fund shall be deemed supplemental to and shall in no way supplant funding that would otherwise be appropriated for these purposes. The department shall prepare, by February 1 of each year, an accounting of the funds received and expended from the fund. The report shall be made available to the members of the State Transportation Board, the Senate Transportation Committee, the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, and to members of the public on request.

The department shall also prepare a form to be submitted by any person or entity seeking a credit under this subsection.

       - While the law authorizes the cooperation of counties and municipal corporations with the Department of Transportation for the purpose of establishing limited access highways, there is nothing in the statute or in the law generally which expressly or by implication makes one of the cooperating governmental entities liable for the unilateral tortious acts of another cooperating governmental entity in a project of this type.

       Courts may, and the Court of Appeals does, take judicial cognizance that municipalities and counties are separately created and possess divergent powers; accordingly, the unilateral action of one may not be construed as imposing liability upon the other even though the action taken by the one may be under a statute authorizing a cooperative effort.

     <p>
      The department, a county, or a municipality may acquire private property and property rights for limited-access facilities and service roads, including rights of access, of view, of air, and of light through gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation in the same manner as such governmental units are authorized by law to acquire such property or property rights in connection with public roads within their respective jurisdictions. Public property or an interest therein may be acquired for such purposes by the department or by a county or municipality by any method authorized by law for such acquisition other than condemnation. The acquisition of public property or an interest therein for such purposes by condemnation may be accomplished by the department pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of Code Section 32-3-4 when such acquisition is approved by the State Commission on the Condemnation of Public Property as provided in Code Section 50-16-183. As used in this Code section, the term "public property" has the meaning provided for in Code Section 50-16-180. In the process of acquiring property or property rights for any limited-access facility, the department or the county or municipality, in its discretion, may acquire an entire lot, block, or tract of land if, by so doing, the interest of the public will best be served.

     <p>
      Limited-access roads may be so designed as to regulate, restrict, or prohibit access thereto so as to best serve the traffic for which such facility is intended. The authority designating and establishing any limited-access road is authorized to divide and separate such highway into separate roadways by the construction of raised curbings, central dividing sections, or other physical separations or by designating such separate roadways by signs, markers, or stripes; to designate the proper lanes for traffic moving in opposite directions; and to prohibit the making of turns at specified points. The designating authority may recommend to the commissioner of public safety or, if the roads in question are in a municipality, to the municipality that there be fixed on such roads and on the separate lanes thereof such rates of speed as are deemed in the public interest. No person shall have any right of ingress to or egress from or passage across any limited-access road to or from abutting lands except at the designated points to which access may be permitted and under such arrangements and conditions as may be specified from time to time.

In undertaking such removal, relocation, or adjustment, if the department has notified the utility in writing that the facility constitutes an obstruction or interference with the construction, use, or safe operation of the roadway, then the utility shall be exempt from the requirements of Code Sections 22-1-10 and 22-1-10.1. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed so as to deprive any utility relocated from a location in which it owned a property interest of compensation for such interest.

       Whenever the department reasonably determines it necessary to have a utility facility removed, relocated, or adjusted, the department shall give to the utility at least 60 days' written notice directing it to begin the physical removal, or relocation, or adjustment of such utility obstruction or interference. If such notice is part of a highway improvement project, it is normally provided at the date of advertisement or award. However, prior to the notice directing the physical removal, relocation, or adjustment of a utility facility, the utility and the department shall adhere to the department's utility relocation procedures for public road improvements which shall include but not be limited to the following:

If the utility fails to submit to the department the plans within the allotted 120 days, the department may no longer be required to pay the costs of removal, relocation, or adjustment as prescribed in subsection (b) of Code Section 32-6-170 even if those costs had previously been included in the contract between the department and the department's contractor; instead, such costs shall be borne by the utility; and

          If the utility does not thereafter begin removal, relocation, or adjustment within the time specified in the work plan, the department may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall commence not later than ten days from the receipt of such final notice. If such utility does not, within ten days from receipt of such final notice, begin to remove, relocate, or adjust the facility or, having so begun removal, relocation, or adjustment, thereafter fails to complete the removal, relocation, or adjustment within the time specified in the work plan, the department may exercise its right to obtain injunctive relief as provided in Code Section 32-6-175. If utility removal, relocation, or adjustment work is found necessary after the letting date of the highway improvement project, the utility shall provide a revised work plan within 30 calendar days after becoming aware of such additional work or upon receipt of the department's written notification advising of such additional work. The utility's revised work plan shall be reviewed by the department to ensure compliance with additional work.

       When track of a railroad company crosses track of another railroad company in a city street, the duty of keeping the crossing in repair rests upon both companies, and either may and should make all necessary repairs, but the company making the repairs may recover the expense of such repairs from other company, if, as between the companies, the duty of making repairs was upon the latter.

       Whenever the department, a county, or a municipality shall decide to eliminate any grade crossing on its respective public road system by means of an underpass or overpass, prompt notice of such decision shall be given to the railroad or railroads involved; and within 30 days thereafter the representatives of the department, the county, or the municipality and of the railroads involved shall meet and, within 90 days, agree to a plan and specifications for the construction of a grade separation structure. Any such agreement between a county or municipality and a railroad shall be submitted to the department for its approval; and work leading to the elimination of the grade crossing pursuant to the agreement shall not commence until and unless the department approves the same. The department, county, or municipality, by agreement with the railroad or railroads involved, may apportion the work to be done in the construction of such grade separation structure between the railroad or railroads and the department or the county or the municipality.

It shall be the duty of said railroad to begin work on any such grade separation structure within four months after receipt of an order to that effect and to complete that structure within a reasonable time, provided that the railroad shall not be required to do the actual physical work of providing approaches by fill to an overpass or the excavating beneath an underpass or the approaches thereto, although the cost of such work shall be considered as part of the costs of the grade crossing elimination, whether actually performed by the railroad, the department, the county, or the municipality; and such costs shall be apportioned as provided in Code Section 32-6-195. If the railroad does not begin work within four months after receipt of an order to that effect, the department, county, or municipality may proceed with the construction of the proposed grade separation structure. If the railroad begins work within four months after receipt of an order to that effect but thereafter fails to complete such work within a reasonable time, the department, county, or municipality may proceed to complete the unfinished work.

In the event that the railroad does not make payment or arrange to make payment to the department, county, or municipality within 60 days of receipt of the statement, the department shall certify the amount for collection to the Attorney General; or, in the case of a project on a county or municipal public road system, the county or municipality shall take appropriate action for the collection of the amount thereof.

      Any junkyard which comes into existence after April 6, 1967, the establishment, operation, or maintenance of which is made unlawful by Code Section 32-6-241, is declared to be a public and private nuisance and may be forthwith removed, obliterated, or abated at the order of the commissioner. The department may then submit by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery a statement of the expenses of such removal, obliteration, or abatement to the person owning or operating such junkyard; and, if payment is not made to the department within 60 days of receipt thereof, the department shall certify the amount for collection to the Attorney General.

       - If public interest is not the motive which prompts vacating of a street, whether partial or entire, the act of vacating is an abuse of power, and a gross abuse of power if it is authorized without reference to the rights of the public and merely for the convenience of a private individual.

       - Power and authority conferred upon State Highway Board (now State Transportation Board) to change or relocate state-aid roads, and thus to abandon portions of those roads, does not specifically or by necessary implication include power to foreclose rights of counties or general public to establish easements over abandoned portions of such roads.

Whenever the department abandons a road and a county or a municipality takes over the road, the department shall convey, by quitclaim deed executed by the commissioner, such road to the county or municipality. If the appropriate county or municipality is unwilling to take over the road and maintain it, the property may be disposed of by the department as provided in Code Section 32-7-4, provided that, if the county or municipality has not indicated its desire to take over the road within 30 days after receiving notice, it shall be conclusively presumed that the county or municipality is unwilling to take over the road; and provided, further, that before the department disposes of the abandoned road it shall give 15 days' notice to the county or municipality, during which time such county or municipality may reconsider its decision and take over the road.

The 1994 amendment added a provision requiring a county to publish notice of the determination to abandon a road in the legal organ of the county, but also retained the language requiring "notice to property owners located thereon." By adding a notice by publication requirement, the legislature must have intended to add a requirement different from the requirement of notice to adjoining property owners.

       - When the public has ceased to use a road for reasons other than the road's state of disrepair, a county is not required to undertake to repair and maintain the road as a prerequisite to abandoning the road in accordance with O.C.G.A.

       Group of landowners were properly granted a writ of mandamus requiring a county to maintain an adjacent road, as the county acquired title to the road by prescriptive acquisition, abandonment was not an issue, and compliance with O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c03s32-3-3ol1c" target="_self">32-3-3(c)</a></cite> did not need to be shown when a roadway was otherwise acquired by prescription; moreover, urging that a county's failure to meet the county's obligation to maintain public roads was an acceptable method of abandoning a roadway would encourage counties to disregard their public duty.

       When the county sought to abandon two roads, notice by publication was insufficient to meet the requirement of notice to adjoining property owners; thus, the showing of such notice by the owners who claimed title to the roads did not entitle them to summary judgment.

       - Authority conferred upon the State Highway Board (now State Transportation Board) to change or relocate state-aid roads, and thus to abandon portions of those roads, does not specifically or by necessary implication include the power to foreclose rights of counties or general public to establish easements over abandoned portions of such roads.

      Whenever any property has been acquired in any manner by the department, a county, or a municipality for public road purposes and thereafter the department, county, or municipality determines that all or any part of the property or any interest therein is no longer needed for such purposes because of changed conditions, the department or the county or municipality is authorized to dispose of such property or such interest therein in accordance with Code Section 32-7-4.

       In order that any interest in real property acquired for public road or other transportation purposes may be used most economically, the department, counties, or municipalities, in addition to the authority granted in Code Section 32-7-3 to dispose of property no longer needed and in subsection (b) of Code Section 32-3-3 to exchange property, may, notwithstanding Article 2 of Chapter 16 of Title 50, the "State Properties Code," improve, use, maintain, or lease any interest in property acquired for public road or other transportation purposes that is not presently needed for such purposes.

       If the department, a county, or municipality decides to lease any such property or interest therein, the owner of such property at the time of its acquisition or his successor in interest shall have the right to lease such property at an appraised fair market value to be determined by the department, county, or municipality for such period of time until the property is needed for public road or other transportation purposes. However, if at the time of acquisition such property was leased to a tenant, the tenant, instead of the owner or his successor in interest, shall have the first right to lease such property at the appraised fair market value. If the owner, his successor in interest, or the tenant of the property does not lease such property, the department, county, or municipality shall have the right to lease such property at a price equal to the highest sealed public bid, if the bid is acceptable to the department, county, or municipality, for such period of time until the property is needed for public road or other transportation purposes. If no bids or bids which are insufficient are received, the department, county, or municipality may readvertise for new public bids. The department, county, or municipality may negotiate a lease with any state or federal agency, county, or municipality without the aforesaid requirement of sealed bids or leasing to the former owner. The department, county, or municipality shall have the right to impose reasonable restrictions, terms, or conditions on the use of such leased property.

       Separate and distinct from the department's authority to lease property in subsection (b) of this Code section, the department has the authority to negotiate a lease of any property contained within the rights of way of any nonlimited-access public road and not presently needed for public road purposes or rights of way under bridges or viaducts on limited-access public roads and not presently needed for public road purposes. If the department decides to lease any such property, the property shall be leased, at an appraised fair market value to be determined by the department, to the owner or the lessee of the property adjacent to the department's rights of way for the purposes of parking. Such property shall only be used for the purposes of providing parking and shall not be subleased without the department's prior approval. Plans for the use of said property must be submitted to and approved by the department prior to any construction. Regardless of any financial expenditures by the lessee, no lease granted under this subsection shall merge into and become a property interest of the lessee or a sublessee. The department shall reserve the right to terminate any lease without cause upon 30 days' written notice to the lessee. Notwithstanding any provisions of Code Section 48-2-17, all net revenues derived from the lease of any of the department's property used for the purposes of providing parking shall be utilized by the department to offset the cost of maintaining the public roads of the state.

      The department shall have the authority, as a last resort, to provide replacement housing when a state-aid project on the state highway system cannot proceed to actual construction because no comparable replacement sale or rental housing is available. In carrying out the relocation assistance activities, the department, with prior concurrence of the board, shall be authorized to make payments, construct or reconstruct with its own forces, cause to be constructed or reconstructed, and purchase by deed or condemnation any real property for the purposes of relocating or constructing replacement housing. The department may exchange, lease, or sell to the displaced person such replacement housing. Whenever any real property has been acquired under this Code section and thereafter the department determines that all or any part of said property or any interest therein is no longer needed for such purposes because of changed conditions, the department is authorized to dispose of such property or interest therein in accordance with subsection (b) of Code Section 32-7-4.

     <p>
      In and as an integral but independent part of the bond validation proceedings under this article, or separately, the authority is given the right to and privilege of a simultaneous or separate right of action or equitable bill against the state, the board, and the department for a declaratory adjudication of the validity and binding effect of all lease contracts whose rental income may be pledged or partially pledged to the benefit of any bonds being validated. In each instance of the exercise of this right the actual controversy shall be whether or not the purported contracts contested are in all respects good and sufficient, valid, and binding obligations of the board and department. Any citizens of the state may intervene in such actions and assert any ground of objection. It shall be incumbent upon the board and department to defend against an adjudication of such validity or be forever bound unto the authority and all succeeding to the rights of the authority thereafter. Such adjudications may be rendered as an integral but independent part of the judgment upon the validation issue with which they are contested or may be rendered separately.

It is found, determined, and declared that the necessities of revenue bond financing are such that the authority's toll earnings on each project or projects, in conjunction with other funds available to the authority, must exceed the actual maintenance, repair, and normal reserve requirements of such projects, together with monthly or yearly sums needed for the sinking fund payments upon the principal and interest obligations of financing such project or projects; however, within the framework of these legitimate necessities of the authority and subject to all bond resolutions, trust indentures, and all other contractual obligations of the authority, the authority is charged with the duty of the operation of all projects in the aggregate at the most reasonable possible level of toll charges; and, furthermore, the authority is charged with the responsibility of a reasonable and equitable adjustment of such toll charges as between the various classes of users of any given project in which the repayment of financing is the primary or exclusive purpose for the exercise of the toll power of the authority.

         No motor vehicle shall be driven or towed through a toll collection facility, where appropriate signs have been erected to notify traffic that it is subject to the payment of tolls beyond such sign, without payment of the proper toll. In the event of nonpayment of the proper toll, as evidenced by video or electronic recording, the registered owner of such vehicle shall be liable to make prompt payment to the authority of the proper toll and an administrative fee of up to $25.00 per violation to recover the cost of collecting the toll. The authority or its authorized agent shall provide notice to the registered owner of a vehicle, and a reasonable time to respond to such notice, of the authority's finding of a violation of this subsection. The authority or its authorized agent may provide subsequent notices to the registered owner of a vehicle if such owner fails to respond to the initial notice. The administrative fee may increase with each notice, provided that such fee shall not exceed a cumulative total of $25.00 per violation. Upon failure of the registered owner of a vehicle to pay the proper toll and administrative fee to the authority after notice thereof and within the time designated in such notice, the authority may proceed to seek collection of the proper toll and the administrative fee as debts owing to the authority, in such manner as the authority deems appropriate and as permitted under law. If the authority finds multiple failures by a registered owner of a vehicle to pay the proper toll and administrative fee after notice thereof and within the time designated in such notices, the authority may refer the matter to the Office of State Administrative Hearings. The scope of any hearing held by the Office of State Administrative Hearings shall be limited to consideration of evidence relevant to a determination of whether the registered owner has failed to pay, after notice thereof and within the time designated in such notice, the proper toll and administrative fee. The only affirmative defense that may be presented by the registered owner of a vehicle at such a hearing is theft of the vehicle, as evidenced by presentation at the hearing of a copy of a police report showing that the vehicle has been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation. A determination by the Office of State Administrative Hearings of multiple failures to pay by a registered owner of a vehicle shall subject such registered owner to imposition of, in addition to any unpaid tolls and administrative fees, a civil monetary penalty payable to the authority of not more than $70.00 per violation. Upon failure by a registered owner to pay to the authority, within 30 days of the date of notice thereof, the amount determined by the Office of State Administrative Hearings as due and payable for multiple violations of this subsection, the motor vehicle registration of such registered owner shall be immediately suspended by operation of law. The authority shall give notice to the Department of Revenue of such suspension. Such suspension shall continue until the proper toll, administrative fee, and civil monetary penalty as have been determined by the Office of State Administrative Hearings are paid to the authority. The authority may seek to collect the debt owed through setoff by the Department of Revenue under procedures set forth in Article 7 of Chapter 7 of Title 48. Actions taken by the authority under this subsection shall be made in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the members of the authority.

         The registered owner of a vehicle which is observed being driven or towed through a toll collection facility without payment of the proper toll may avoid liability under this subsection by presenting to the authority a copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation.

         For purposes of this subsection, for any vehicle which is registered to an entity other than a natural person, the term "registered owner" shall be deemed to refer to the natural person who is the operator of such motor vehicle at the time of the violation of this subsection, but only if the entity to which the vehicle is registered has supplied to the authority, within 60 days following notice from the authority or its authorized agent, information in the possession of such entity which is sufficient to identify and give notice to the natural person who was the operator of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation of this subsection.
