       - Subsequently-enacted legislation which stated that if an administrator was not appointed within five years after the death of an intestate, then the estate property would be vested in decedent's heirs, and which did not mention anything about divestment of the estate property, did not apply to prevent the probate court from granting the estate administrator's petition to distribute decedent's property even though the estate administrator was not appointed for nearly four decades after the death of the decedent, as the law in effect at the time the estate administrator was appointed had no time limit for the appointment and the subsequently-enacted legislation did not apply to prohibit the estate administrator from being appointed and distributing the property.

        COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Former OCGA Title 53 contained no general definitions section.
   This section combines definitions that appeared in various sections of former Title 53 as well as adding new definitions.
   Subsection (a) includes as an "administrator" an "administrator de bonis non" of an intestate estate and subsection (b) includes as an "administrator with the will annexed" an "administrator de bonis non" of a testate estate.
   The concept of "administrator de bonis non" appeared in former OCGA Secs. 53-6-30 and 53-6-31.
   The term "beneficiary" in subsection (c) is used to replace the words "legatee" and "devisee" that appeared in former Title 53. The term is defined somewhat differently in OCGA Sec. 53-12-2 for use throughout Chapter 12 (Trusts).
   The definition of "codicil" that appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-2-5 is modified and placed in subsection (d).
   Subsection (e) carries forward the definition of "County Administrator" that appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-6-90.
   Former OCGA Title 53 contained no definition of the term "descendants".
   This term, which is now defined in subsection (f), is used to replace the term "lineal descendants" in former Title 53. Subsection (g) includes as an "executor" any person who is nominated in the will, whether that person is the executor or a successor executor.
   Subsection (i) distinguishes a "nominated executor" as one who has been nominated in the will but has not yet qualified. Former OCGA Title 53 contained no definition of the terms "guardian" or "heirs".
   The term "heirs," as defined in subsection (i), is used to replace the term "heirs at law" from former Title 53. Subsection (k) contains the same definition of "person" that appears in the Georgia Trust Code at Sec. 53-12-2(5), with the addition of limited liability companies.
   Subsection (l) introduces the term "Personal Representative," which includes administrators, administrators with the will annexed, county administrators and executors, but does not include temporary administrators.
   In order to meet the definitions of subsections (a), (b), (e), (g), and (o), a person must have "qualified" to serve as a personal representative, as defined in subsection (m).
   Subsection (m) provides that a personal representative has "qualified" upon the taking of the oath, the issuance of appropriate letters and the posting of any required bond.
   The term "sui juris" in subsection (n) describes an individual who is of legal age and suffering under no other legal disability.
   Subsection (o) carries forward portions of the definition of "Temporary Administrator" that appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-6-34. The term "testamentary gift" in subsection (p) is used to replace the terms "legacy" and "devise".
   The definition of the term "will" in subsection (q) appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-2-1.
   The definition is modified to add that the will may speak of matters other than the disposition of property (for example, the appointment of a guardian for minor children of the decedent) and that, unless the context otherwise requires, the "will" includes the will and all codicils to it.

       - Temporary administrator's right to attorney fees may not extend beyond fees for such services as may have been necessary to assist the administrator in the securing of temporary letters of administration and the collection and preservation of the assets of the estate. Hudson v. Abercrombie, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 729</cite>, <cite class="app_court">374 S.E.2d 83</cite> (1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>

        Definition of a will makes disposition of property an indispensable requisite
       
       under Georgia law and to do this a legatee is essential. Lawson v. Hurt, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">125 S.E.2d 480</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-101).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When the sole legatee died prior to the death of the testator, there was no legatee
       
       and consequently no disposition of property by the instrument offered for probate. Lawson v. Hurt, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">125 S.E.2d 480</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,

        COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section modifies former OCGA Sec. 53-4-6.
   This section expands the forfeiture provisions to apply not only to the killer's right to take a property interest from the decedent but also to serve as a fiduciary of the decedent's estate or any trust created by the decedent.
   The rule applies only to prevent a killer from receiving benefits from the slain person or serving as a fiduciary and does not affect the distribution of the killer's estate.
   (See OCGA Sec. 33-25-13, which contains a similar rule relating to the receipt of benefits from a life insurance policy.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to situations in which the "killing" is such as would constitute murder, felony murder, or voluntary manslaughter, as described in OCGA Secs. 16-5-1 and 16-5-2. The section does not apply to homicide by vehicle, as defined in OCGA Sec. 40-6-393.
   The nature of the killing may be established either by a criminal conviction or a guilty plea or, in a civil proceeding, by clear and convincing evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) carries forward the rule of former OCGA Sec. 53-4-6 that the share of the individual who engages in the felonious and intentional killing is distributed as if the killer predeceased the decedent.
   Additionally, the appointment of personal representatives or trustees will proceed as if the killer had predeceased the decedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) clarifies that the descendants of the killer are not precluded from taking from the slain person's estate or serving as personal representative or trustee. However, if the descendants are taking by intestacy in place of the killer, the descendants may not take a greater share of the decedent's estate than the share to which the killer would have been entitled. This subsection prevents unfairness in those circumstances in which the treatment of an individual as having predeceased the decedent would result in a diminution of the shares that other individuals would have received had that individual not been treated as having predeceased the decedent.
   The following example illustrates the application of this rule:
   Assume that a decedent who dies intestate is survived by a brother who has three children and by the one child of a predeceased sister. Under Code Sec. 53-2-1, the sister's child takes one-half of the estate and the brother takes one-half of the estate. But if the brother (as well as the sister) had predeceased the decedent, the same statute directs that the four nieces and nephews of the decedent would share the estate equally. Consequently, the sister's child's share would be diminished to one-fourth. The last sentence of subsection (b) avoids that result by providing that, if the brother is treated as having predeceased the decedent because he killed the decedent, the brother's children (who are taking in place of the brother) will only take the one-half interest that the brother would have taken. Subsection (c) also reflects the rule that Code Sec. 53-4-64 (the anti-lapse statute) does not apply in cases in which a beneficiary is treated as having predeceased the testator due to the fact that the beneficiary killed the testator unless the individuals who would take as substitute beneficiaries for their "predeceased" parent are also descendants of the testator.

       - In an estate administrator's conversion suit against a law firm, the trial court properly granted the law firm summary judgment with regard to the administrator attempting to recover $125,000 in legal fees the decedent's spouse had paid to the law firm as the law firm accepted the fees from the decedent's spouse in good faith since it was not determined until the spouse pled guilty to the homicide that the spouse had killed the decedent. Further, there was no evidence that the spouse did not have title to the money when the money was paid. Levenson v. Word, <cite class="ga_app_court">294 Ga.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c01s53-1-5" target="_self">53-1-5</a></cite> did not place possession or an immediate right to possession of the estate property in the administrator at the time the widow dispersed and appellees received the funds in issue; when the widow dispersed the finds, the widow had qualified as executor of the decedent's estate and letters testamentary had been issued to the widow, the widow had not yet pled guilty to the murder charges, no final judgment of conviction had been entered in regard to the criminal indictment, and the widow's felonious and intentional killing of the decedent had not been established by clear and convincing evidence in any judicial proceeding.

       - Ga. L. 1959, p. 299,
   §
   1 suggests that it refers to heritable property owned by the decedent and properly a part of the decedent's estate. While an insured is the owner of a contract of insurance on the insured's own life, this is a different sort of ownership because the insured cannot, unless the insured elects to turn the policy in for the policy's cash surrender value, make the policy's proceeds available to the insured during the insured's lifetime. National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Thornton, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 589</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E.2d 435</cite> (1972) (decided under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299,

       <p>
        <p>
       The legislative scheme under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299,
   §
   1 is clear that unless the insured affirmatively indicates that the estate is intended as beneficiary, the policy proceeds go to the beneficiary as against the claims of creditors or personal representatives of the deceased. This is generally true even when no beneficiary is named in the policy, but a statute indicates for whose benefit the proceeds are to be used in such event. National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Thornton, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 589</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E.2d 435</cite> (1972) (decided under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299,

        <p>
       When insured could have changed beneficiary at any time, Ga. L. 1959, p. 299,
   §
   1 does not prohibit the payment of proceeds from life insurance policies to insured's estate where insured killed the policies' beneficiary and then himself. Willis v.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-4-50 and 53-4-53 and portions of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-105.
   The section combines the treatment of lifetime transfers in both intestate and testate estates.
   This section clarifies that a lifetime transfer may be a satisfaction if the property transferred was the subject of a specific testamentary gift or that such a transfer may be an advancement if it represents some or all of the recipient's prospective intestate share or of a demonstrative, general, or residuary testamentary gift.
   (See Code Sec. 53-4-59 for a description of specific, demonstrative, general, and residuary testamentary gifts.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This section modifies the former laws of satisfaction and advancements by requiring written evidence that an inter-vivos transfer was intended to operate as a satisfaction or an advancement against the testamentary gift or intestate share the recipient would eventually receive.
   The section requires either that the will specifically contemplate the treatment of the lifetime transfer as a satisfaction or advancement or a separate written expression or acknowledgement of intent.
   The writing may either be one signed by the transferor within 30 days of the transfer or one signed by the recipient at any time.

        Ademption is confined to specific legacies.
       
       Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">231 U.S. 753</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 322</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L. Ed. 467</cite> (1913); Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E.2d 261</cite> (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Legacy is not a specific legacy, which will be adeemed when it does not bequeath a bond so labeled and sequestered as to be distinguished from another bond of a similar kind; it is a demonstrative legacy and does not fail if the subject matter is not in existence on the death of the testator. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a will may reasonably be construed as showing an intention of the testator to bequeath to the six legatees something of the value of $1,000.00 each, and only three bonds remain, the will stating the $1,000.00 payments to be made from bonds, a fair and just execution of the will, as found by the trial court, would be to sell the three bonds and place the proceeds in the general assets and from that fund pay the six legatees $1,000.00 each. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Failure by the testator to particularize the $1,000.00 bonds bequeathed to stated children, forbid their being classified as specific legacies, and, consequently they do not fail but are payable as general legacies, $1,000.00 to each legatee, out of the general assets of the estate, including the proceeds from the sale of the three bonds on hand after the payment of debts, if any, and the expenses of administration. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947).

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.09.html#t09c11s9-11-56" target="_blank">9-11-56</a></cite>, was reversed since a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether a transfer of money to the decedent's child before the decedent died was an advancement on the child's inheritance, and whether the child breached the fiduciary duty as a result.

        In cases of intestacy, law favors equal distribution among intestate's heirs.
       
       There are only two ways by which the scheme of equality among the heirs may be upset. The first, of course, is by the making of a will on the part of the ancestor providing for a distribution of the ancestor's estate in a manner other than that set forth by law; and, the second is by a valid and binding contract executed between the ancestor and the heir, which clearly shows a meeting of the minds between them acknowledging on the part of the heir receipt in full for the heir's prospective share of the ancestor's estate. Such a contract when entered into is binding and enforceable. Cassedy v. Bland, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 34</cite>, <cite class="app_court">107 S.E.2d 697</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - Ademption of a specific legacy is the extinction or withdrawal of it, in consequence of some act of the testator equivalent to its revocation, or clearly indicative of an intention to revoke. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">231 U.S. 753</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 322</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L. Ed. 467</cite> (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3908).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ademption is effected by the extinction of the thing or fund bequeathed, or by disposition of it subsequent to the will from which an intention that the legacy should fail is presumed. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">231 U.S. 753</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 322</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Term "ademption" is sometimes used as synonymous with satisfaction, but such use is inaccurate, as ademption operates independently of intention in case the specific thing given is, at the testator's death, no longer owned by testator. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">231 U.S. 753</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 322</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L.

        <p>
       - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterward become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Thompson v. Long, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 718</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 651</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-817).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Standard for defining a "conveyance"
       
       is whether there has occurred a change in the testator's ownership sufficiently radical to manifest, as a matter of law, the testator's intention to revoke the specific devise. The term "conveyance" includes a single transaction by which a testator sells the testator's fee simple title to real estate in return for a security title to the real estate sold. Peacock v. Owens, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 458</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-817).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Ademption arises upon the conveyance of the specific property covered by the legacy,
       
       and rests upon a rule of law independent of any supposed actual intent of the testator; and in the absence of any facts which would bring the case within the exceptions set forth in statute, and in the absence of any provision in the will in contemplation of such a contingency, a trial court properly held that a devise had been wholly adeemed by reason of the conveyance of the realty involved, and since the testator died intestate as to this devise, that the proceeds thereof passed into the residuum of the estate. Thompson v. Long, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 718</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 651</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterwards become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Moncrief v. Shuman, <cite class="ga_court">169 Ga. 217</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E. 98</cite> (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       <p>
        <p>
       When a testator conveys to a third party specific property devised and the will contains no provision for such a contingency, there can be no inquiry into a testator's intention in adeeming specifically bequeathed property. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E.2d 261</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When wife devised one-half interest in real estate to husband by specific devise, but did not devise the proceeds of its sale to husband, the specific devise was adeemed by alienation when testator sold the fee simple title in return for a down payment, note, and security title.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - There are four exceptions to the rule that ademption occurs when a testator conveys to another the specific property bequeathed, those exceptions are: (1) where the testator afterwards becomes possessed of the same property; (2) where the attempt to convey fails; (3) where the testator exchanges the property for other of like character; and (4) where the testator merely changes the investment of a fund bequeathed. Lang v. Vaughn, <cite class="ga_court">137 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E. 270</cite>, 40 L.R.A. (n.s.) 542, 1913B Ann. Cas. 52 (1912) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A specific devise is adeemed when, after the execution of the will, the testator "conveys" to another the specific property devised unless one of the following four exceptions applies: reacquisition by the testator; failure of the conveyance; receipt of like property in exchange for the devised property and mere change in the investment of a fund.

      <p>
       This section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-4-51.
   Under subsection (a), in the event of the satisfaction of a specific testamentary gift, the beneficiary receives no property in replacement of that gift. (This subsection reflects the rule of ademption by satisfaction that appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-2-105.)
   Under subsection (b), if the advancement is of a demonstrative or general testamentary gift, the amount of the advancement is charged against any amount the beneficiary is slated to receive under the will.
   Subsection (c) outlines the traditional "hotchpot" method of taking advancements into account.
   This method is applied in the case of a beneficiary of a residuary share of the transferor's estate or an heir. The "hotchpot" is calculated by adding to the value of the transferor's residuary or intestate estate the value of all advancements made by the transferor except advancements of demonstrative or general testamentary gifts and satisfactions.
   Then each recipient's "distributable share" is determined. If an advancement is less than the recipient's distributable share of the estate, the value of the advancement must be charged against any share the recipient is due to receive. For example, suppose the recipient (R) received an advancement valued at $50,000.
   The transferor dies intestate, survived only by three children (A, B, and R) and with an intestate estate of $250,000. The value of R's advancement will be added back to the value of the estate, bringing the value of the "hotchpot" estate to $300,000.
   Under the laws of intestacy, each of the children is due to receive 1/3 of the estate ("distributable shares" of $100,000 each).
   However, since R has already received $50,000 as an advancement, R's distributable share of $100,000 is charged with the advancement so that R receives only an additional $50,000 from the probate estate.
   A and B each receive $100,000.
   If the recipient's advancement equals or exceeds the value of the recipient's distributable share, then the advancement is ignored and the recipient receives nothing further from the estate.
   For example, suppose R received an advancement of $150,000 and the transferor died intestate with an estate of $180,000.
   The hotchpot estate would equal $330,000 ($180,000 + $150,000), thus entitling each heir to a "distributable share" of $110,000.
   However, since R has already received $150,000, the value of the advancement is not brought into the hotchpot estate.
   R receives nothing further from the estate, and A and B split the $180,000 estate evenly between themselves.

         In cases of intestacy, law favors equal distribution among intestate's heirs.

       - In an accounting under this statute when the main object of the litigation is to ascertain and settle authoritatively the amount which each distributee has been advanced by the intestate, the verdict should find the several amounts specifically. The law, and not the jury, determines whether advancements shall be accounted for. Andrews v. Halliday, <cite class="ga_court">63 Ga. 263</cite> (1879) (decided under former Code 1873,
   §
   2582).

       <p>
        <p>
       There are only two ways by which the scheme of equality among the heirs may be upset. The first, of course, is by the making of a will on the part of the ancestor providing for a distribution of the ancestor's estate in a manner other than that set forth by law; and, the second is by a valid and binding contract executed between the ancestor and the heir which clearly shows a meeting of the minds between them acknowledging on the part of the heir receipt in full for the heir's prospective share of the ancestor's estate. Such a contract when entered into is binding and enforceable. Cassedy v. Bland, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 34</cite>, <cite class="app_court">107 S.E.2d 697</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

      <p>
       This subsection replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-2-115.
   The section mirrors the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 2518 and related United States Treasury Regulations. The section is not intended to preempt other common law or statutory forms of renunciation but rather to provide a mechanism whereby persons may make renunciations that constitute "qualified disclaimers" under that Internal Revenue Code section.

        COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) carries forward the second sentences of former OCGA Sec. 53-4-2(4) and Sec. 53-4-2(5).
   Paragraph (a)(1) adds the requirement that a child of the decedent be conceived prior to the decedent's death, be born within ten months of the decedent's death, and survive birth by at least 120 hours or more to be considered an heir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-4-1 through 53-4-3 and differs from those Code sections in the treatment of the surviving spouse, parents of the decedent, and descendants of the siblings of the decedent. A surviving spouse is guaranteed at least one-third of the decedent's intestate estate, as opposed to one-fourth of the estate under former Sec. 53-4-2(2). While former OCGA Sec. 53-4-2(6) included a decedent's parents in the same degree as the decedent's siblings, the new Code section puts parents in a degree superior to that of siblings.
   Former Sec. 53-4-2(5) included in the second degree only children or grandchildren of the decedent's siblings; the new Section includes all descendants of the decedent's siblings.

       - Despite evidence of a parent's cruel treatment of the parent's decedent child, the trial court erred in finding that the parent forfeited parental rights, and thus lost the status as a parent and, in so doing, lost the right to recover as an heir of the decedent's estate, as the loss of parental power did not necessarily result in a parent's loss of a right to inherit as an heir from the estate of that parent's child, short of having the parent's rights terminated prior to the child's death; hence, summary judgment against the parent on the issue was reversed.

       This Code section carries over the concepts of former OCGA Sec. 53-4-4.
   Subsection (a) of the former Code section is eliminated as unnecessary.
   Subsection 2(A)(v) of the current law modifies the former law by requiring clear and convincing evidence of the paternity and the existence of a de facto parent-child relationship, or proof that such relationship would have existed if the father had not died before the child was born.
   This replaces the requirement of former law that it be shown that the father intended the child to share in the father's estate in the same manner as if the child were legitimate.

        <p>
       - Doctrine of virtual or equitable legitimation will allow an illegitimate child to inherit from the child's intestate father's estate when the evidence is clear and convincing. Prince v. Black, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 79</cite>, <cite class="app_court">344 S.E.2d 411</cite> (1986), rev'g, <cite class="ga_app_court">176 Ga.

       </p>

        <p>
       Child born out of wedlock is not required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child's natural father intended the child to share in his estate as prescribed by the rules of descent and distribution, just that he intended that the child take from his estate. Varner v. Sharp, <cite class="ga_app_court">219 Ga. App. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">464 S.E.2d 388</cite> (1995) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If a child born out of wedlock does prove that decedent was the child's father and that he intended for the child to take from the estate, the court must determine, based upon the rules of intestate succession, the amount to which the child is entitled; the burden of proving such amount does not rest with the child.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When decedent's actions indicated that decedent was in the process of taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the child whom he and his cohabitant had conceived would be born into a legitimate family environment, and everything necessary for his divorce from his estranged wife was complete except for the final decree, there was clear and convincing evidence that decedent intended for his unborn child to be born into a legitimate family environment, and his unexpected death would not defeat the claim of the child, who could inherit under the doctrine of virtual legitimation. Simpson v. King, <cite class="ga_court">259 Ga. 420</cite>, <cite class="app_court">383 S.E.2d 120</cite> (1989) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - When the owner of a tract of land died in 1926 and the owner's sole surviving heirs were a nephew and niece who died in 1942 and 1947, respectively, each of whom was survived by an illegitimate son, the son of the niece inherited sole title to the property through the maternal line of descent, although he and the son of the nephew have since operated under the assumption that they were co-owners.

       Upon the death of an intestate decedent who is the owner of any interest in real property, the title to any such interest which survives the intestate decedent shall vest immediately in the decedent's heirs at law, subject to divestment by the appointment of an administrator of the estate.

       The title to all other property owned by an intestate decedent shall vest in the administrator of the estate for the benefit of the decedent's heirs and creditors.

       Upon the appointment of an administrator, the title to any interest in real property which survives the intestate decedent shall vest in the administrator for the benefit of the heirs and creditors of the decedent, and title to such property shall not revest in the heirs until the administrator assents to such revesting. For purposes of this Code section, the assent of the administrator shall be proved in the manner set out in Code Section 53-8-15.
      </li>
      <li id="t53c02s53-2-7ol1d">
       Upon the appointment of an administrator, the right to the possession of the whole estate is in the administrator, and, as long as administration continues, the right to recover possession of the estate from all other persons is solely in the administrator. The administrator may recover possession of any part of the estate from the heirs at law or purchasers from them; but, in order to recover real property, it is necessary for the administrator to show, upon the trial, either that the property which is the subject of the action has been in the administrator's possession and without the administrator's consent is held by the defendant at the time of bringing the action or that it is necessary for the administrator to have possession for the purpose of paying the debts, making a proper distribution, or for other purposes provided for by law. An order for sale or distribution, granted by the judge of the probate court after notice to the defendant, shall be conclusive evidence of either fact.

       If an order has been entered under Code Section 53-2-41 that no administration is necessary, or if the administrator has assented to the vesting of title in the heirs, the heirs may take possession of the property or may sue for possession of the property in their own right.

       - Order granting an estate administrator of a deceased shareholder the right to inspect the defendant's corporate books and denying the defendant's motions to compel and stay pending arbitration was affirmed because the statutes governing the transfer of stock to the estate vested ownership of the shares in the administrator of the estate and the probate court's order granted the adminstrator trustee's powers over those shares.

       - Subsequently-enacted legislation which stated that if an administrator was not appointed within five years after the death of an intestate, then the estate property would be vested in decedent's heirs and did not mention anything about divestment of the estate property did not apply to prevent the probate court from granting the estate administrator's petition to distribute decedent's property even though the estate administrator was not appointed for nearly four decades after the death of the decedent as the law in effect at the time the estate administrator was appointed had no time limit for the appointment and the subsequently-enacted legislation did not apply to prohibit the estate administrator from being appointed and distributing the property.

        Title to realty is immediately vested in the heirs of an intestate
       
       upon his or her death. However, if there be a legal representative, the right to recover for the benefit of the heirs is in such representative. If there be no representative, the heirs may sue in their own names to clear title to land. City of Griffin v. McKneely, <cite class="ga_app_court">101 Ga.

        Realty descends directly to the heirs,

        <p>
       On the death of the owner, the title to land vests immediately in the owner's heirs at law, and, on the appointment of an administrator, the right to the possession of the whole estate is in the administrator; but, insofar as real estate is concerned, this is a qualified right solely for the purpose of paying debts and for distribution, when necessary. Smith v. Fischer, <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 406</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       After the grantor in a security deed had died intestate before the date of the sale, the equity of redemption descended by inheritance to the sole heir at law, with the same right to affirm or disaffirm an unlawful sale thereafter made which the grantor personally would have had if the grantor had not died. Delray, Inc. v. Reddick, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 676</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 599</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       When an administrator is granted leave to sell the land of the estate for the purpose of paying debts and distribution, the administrator may collect rents accruing afterwards, and the administrator and the administrator's sureties may be held liable therefor on the administrator's bond. Whether the same would be true as to rents accruing after the intestate's death, but before the order granting leave to sell, it does not appear that rents for any such period would be involved. Jones v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 310</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 34</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Petition, filed by the widow and sole heir at law of a landowner, stating that he died intestate and that there was no administration on his estate, presented a case wherein whatever right or title he might have had descended to her, with the right to sue therefor in her own name.

       Upon the death of the owner of any estate in realty, the title vests immediately in the owner's heirs at law and hence the plaintiffs were entitled to the immediate possession of the deceased's property upon the owner's death intestate. Chalker v. Beasley, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 658</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Upon the death of the owner of any estate in realty, which estate survives the descendent, title vests immediately in the descendent's heirs at law, subject to administration by the legal representative, if there be one, and the right of recovery is in the legal representative, if one; if none, the heirs may sue in the heirs' own name. Slade v. Barber, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 405</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       When the father of the plaintiff died intestate, holding possession of lands under a bond for title with a part of the purchase price paid, the owner had a beneficial interest or equitable estate therein which descended to the owner's heirs at law, and the plaintiff as the sole heir at law could bring an equitable action on the bond for title. Gay v. Radford, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 38</cite>, <cite class="app_court">59 S.E.2d 915</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       When one owning real estate dies, the title to the real estate passes to the heirs, and it is not the duty of the administrator, as such, to collect rents accruing after the death of the intestate; and if the administrator does so, it is not in the administrator's capacity as administrator, and the administrator is not liable to the heirs for the amount of the rents, as administrator, nor is the surety on the administrator's bond as administrator liable. Ray v. Dooley, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 811</cite>, <cite class="app_court">69 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1952) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Upon the death of a husband intestate, leaving children and descendants of deceased children, title to realty owned by the husband vests in such children. Kenner v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since upon the death of the owner of realty, which estate survives the owner, the title vests immediately in the owner's heirs at law, subject to the payment of debts, where the heirs make a settlement of the estate without an administrator, they should make conveyances pursuant to the settlement in order to divest themselves of the legal title of the intestate's estate. Clark v. Perrin, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E.2d 874</cite> (1968) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When an examination of the contested will discloses no manifest intention of the testator which would be contrary to a vesting of the testator's great-great niece's interest at the time of the testator's death; and since her interest was vested in both the corpus and income of the trust estate, this interest was vested immediately in her husband upon her death; and upon his death, his interest passed by will to his three children who consequently have a vested interest in the corpus and income of the trust.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When there was an administration of the estate of the defendant's grantor, the administrator could have sued to recover land for the benefit of the heir at law, on alleged reversion by the terms of the grantor's conveyance; and the right of action was not limited to their heir at law. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Sweat, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 698</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 123</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Before heirs at law of an intestate can recover land, the heirs must allege and prove that there is no administration upon the heirs' estate, or, if there is an administrator, that the administrator has consented to their bringing the suit. Bowman v. Bowman, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 262</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E.2d 497</cite> (1949), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 226</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 242</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the administrator makes a collusive conveyance for the purpose of defrauding those interested in the estate and obtaining a benefit to the administrator, and refuses to give consent for the heirs to sue, they may bring an equitable action against the administrator and the persons charged with being in collusion with the administrator, for the purpose of protecting their rights. Bowman v. Bowman, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 262</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E.2d 497</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While an heir may bring an action to recover property of heir's intestate where there is no administrator, or where the administrator consents to the action, the law plainly gives the administrator the right to recover property held adversely to the estate of the intestate. Andrews v. Walden, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 340</cite>, <cite class="app_court">66 S.E.2d 801</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An heir at law seeking to recover in one's own name all or a part of the estate of a decedent must allege and prove that there was no administration of the estate in this state, or that the administrator was discharged before suit, or that the administrator had consented to the suit. Crawley v. Selby, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 530</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 775</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Effect of bankruptcy automatic stay.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Under Georgia law, when the debtor's mother died intestate, title to the mother's real property automatically vested in the heirs at law which included the debtor and, thus, at the time the debtor filed the debtor's bankruptcy case, the debtor held an interest in the property and the debtor's interest as heir became property of the estate. Because under Georgia law, the appointment of an administrator divested the heirs of their ownership interests directly in the property, a petition for appointment of an administrator was an act to obtain possession of property of the estate in violation of the automatic stay and, further, because it was commenced against the debtor as an heir of the estate, it violated the stay as the commencement of a judicial proceeding against the debtor.

       - Literal application of former Code 1933,
   §§
   113-907 and 113-1512 would lead to the inevitable conclusion that the heirs would under no circumstances be allowed to sue in their own name when there was an administrator unless the administrator consented thereto. But the Supreme Court has broadened the meaning of former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1521 to include a situation where the administrator refuses, and especially where this refusal is fraudulent or collusive, and in such a situation this right of action in the heir exists in the same manner and to the same extent only as it does in the administrator, thus if it exists in the same manner and to the same extent, then it should be given the same effect.

       While an heir may bring an action to recover property of an intestate when there is no administrator, or when the administrator consents to the action, the law plainly gives the administrator the right to recover property held adversely to the estate of an intestate.

       When an administrator sues for land, the administrator makes out a prima facie case for the land's recovery upon proof that the administrator's intestate died seized thereof, and that the estate owes debts, which makes it necessary for the personal representative to administer the land for the payment thereof, the administrator having obtained leave to sell the land, and such prima facie case, the suit being against the heirs at law of a deceased son of the intestate, is not overcome by evidence that the deceased son had made declarations that in his lifetime there had been between the heirs a division in kind of the lands formerly owned by the intestate and that the portion sued for had by such division been set apart to him.

The order is, however, in any event prima facie evidence against the heir.

      <p>
       This section is a modification of former OCGA Sec. 44-5-199. The purpose of this section is to provide an alternative intestacy rule to prevent the escheat of certain property of a decedent if the decedent's spouse dies intestate within six months without ascertainable heirs.
   Under this section, any property of the first decedent to which the spouse is entitled but which has not yet been distributed to the spouse will instead be distributed to the heirs of the first decedent as if the spouse had predeceased the decedent.
   The law relating to escheat is codified at Code Sec. 53-2-50.

      The identity or interest of any heir may be resolved judicially upon application to the probate court that has jurisdiction by virtue of a pending administration or that would have jurisdiction in the event of an administration of the estate of the decedent. Alternatively, the petition may be filed in the superior court of the county where the probate court having jurisdiction, as defined in this Code section, is located.

       This section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-4-11.
   Subsection (c) carries forward the provisions of former OCGA Sec. 53-4-11(b).
   Two options for distributions in kind are available under this section.
   The administrator may make the distribution in kind without the consent of the heirs or a court order if the distribution is made pro rata as to each asset.
   If the distribution in kind is to be made in a manner that is not pro rata as to each asset, the administrator may do so only if all the heirs consent or pursuant to an order from the probate court.
   The procedure for filing a petition for such order is described in the subsequent Code sections.

       - Former Code 1933,
   §§
   1019 and 1020 provided the machinery for carrying into effect the provisions of former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1018. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 688</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1018).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Two features of former Code 1933,
       
       §
       
        113-1018 were especially to be noted:
       
       (1) the application may be made by the "representative" of the estate - it is clearly intended to embrace executors as well as administrators; and (2) the statute contemplates a proceeding for the distribution of the estate. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 688</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1018).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        This statutory proceeding is really a legal substitute for the final division
       
       and final settlement of accounts by an administrator or an executor. It constitutes the last step in winding up an estate with the stamp of judicial approval on the distribution of the estate as made by the representative. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 688</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1018).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Proceedings under this statute were not in the nature of a partition of specific property,
       
       but contemplated a final and complete distribution of the assets of the estate. The devisees and legatees are to receive their share, and all of their share of the estate not previously delivered to them. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 688</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §

       <p>
        <p>
       - A proceeding under this statute differs from a final approval and settlement of an administrator's account after the division of an estate only in that the statute permits the delivery of the assets in kind and relieves the administrator from the necessity of reducing the assets to the form of cash. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 688</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

   113-1018).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If it was practicable, the ordinary (now probate judge) can order a distribution in kind on the application of the administrator or any distributee of the estate provided all the distributees should agree to such a division; for any one of them would have the right to insist upon a sale of the estate and a distribution of the proceeds. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 61</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 776</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Probate court by express statute being clothed with jurisdiction generally to divide the property of decedents in kind, and being a court of original and competent jurisdiction for that purpose, it must be conclusively presumed that the court had before it all necessary and competent evidence to authorize the judgment. In these circumstances, the courts are always extremely loath to enter upon an investigation de novo. Kaiser v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Though it is the rule that a direct proceeding to construe a will must be brought in a court of equity, when the construction of a will is incidentally involved in a proceeding over which the probate court has jurisdiction, this court has jurisdiction under such conditions to interpret the will so far as may be necessary in the proceeding before it. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 688</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Where devisee brings equitable petition against coexecutors of an estate seeking a partition of the property of the estate through a sale by the receiver, and alleging that more than 20 years had elapsed since the executors had qualified, that all the debts of the estate had been paid, and that executors were in possession of all real and personal property belonging to the estate, the allegations are insufficient to authorize the grant of the prayers for equitable petition between the devisees because plaintiff devisee has a full and adequate remedy under the law in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to require executors to distribute the estate by division or partition. Salter v. Salter, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 511</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 241</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Exercise by the superior court of the court's equity jurisdiction in order to fully and adequately resolve all issues between tenants in common would not be an interference with the orderly administration of an estate.

        <p>
       - An order of the probate court, setting apart a given portion to a beneficiary necessarily constitutes a double-barreled adjudication that such beneficiary is entitled to the amount of property awarded, and that the beneficiary is not entitled to more than that awarded the beneficiary.

       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-4-12 and 53-4-13. The section eliminates the use of three appraisers and instead has the probate court order the administrator to distribute assets in kind in accordance with the petition unless an objection to the petition is made.
   If an objection is made, the court is to hear the petition and then, in the court's discretion, order a distribution in kind that is or is not pro rata as to each asset.

        <p>
       - Probate court by express statute being clothed with jurisdiction generally to divide the property of decedents in kind, and being a court of original and competent jurisdiction for that purpose, it must be conclusively presumed that the court had before it all necessary and competent evidence to authorize the judgment. In these circumstances, the courts are always extremely loath to enter upon an investigation de novo. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 688</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1020).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When parties holding as heirs an undivided interest in lands have abandoned, without formally dismissing, a proceeding instituted in the superior court for partition, and agreed among themselves to institute such a proceeding in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to bring about a partition of the same lands, and this is done by appropriate proceeding in that court, resulting in a judgment confining the assignment of the various parcels by the appraisers, no objection being filed or appeal taken, they are bound by such judgment. They will not subsequently be permitted to disregard such judgment, and seek, by amendment to the original petition in superior court, another partitioning of such lands. Zeagler v. Zeagler, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 453</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E.2d 478</cite> (1941) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1020).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When devisee brings equitable petition against coexecutors of an estate seeking a partition of the property of the estate through a sale by the receiver, and alleging that more than 20 years had elapsed since the executors had qualified, that all the debts of the estate had been paid, and that executors were in possession of all real and personal property belonging to the estate, the allegations are insufficient to authorize the grant of the prayers for equitable petition between the devisees because plaintiff devisee has a full and adequate remedy under the law in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to require executors to distribute the estate by division or partition. Salter v. Salter, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 511</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 241</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

      </li>

       The petition shall show: the name and domicile of the decedent; the names, ages or majority status, and domicile of the heirs of the decedent; a description of the property in this state owned by the decedent; that the estate owes no debts or that there are known debts and all creditors have consented or will be served as provided in Chapter 11 of this title; and that the heirs have agreed upon a division of the estate among themselves. The agreement containing original signatures of all the heirs, attested to by a clerk of the probate court or a notary public, shall be attached to the petition. Property subject to an outstanding security deed or agreement may be subject to this proceeding only if the holder of the security deed consents or is served and makes no objection.

       This section carries over former OCGA Sec. 53-10-1 with the modifications that the petition must include a copy of the agreement for division of property and must state either that the estate owes no debts or that there are known debts and all the creditors have consented or will be served.
   The petition must be filed in the county of the decedent's domicile rather than the county of residence as required under former OCGA Sec. 53-10-1.
   Subsection (c) allows the personal representative of a deceased heir to agree to the division on behalf of that heir.
   (See Code section 53-11-2, which authorizes the guardian of an heir to consent on behalf of the heir.)

       - Bringing of a petition under this statute by those who allege themselves to be all of the heirs at law of a deceased gives rise to a presumption that they have reached an agreement for an amicable division of the estate among themselves, whether it be alleged in the petition or not.

      <p>
       This section carries over the paragraphs (b) through (e) of former OCGA Sec. 53-10-2 and Sec. 53-10-3.
   Paragraph (a) of OCGA Sec. 53-10-2 is now encompassed in Chapter 11 of this Title.
   The remaining paragraphs of former OCGA Sec. 53-10-2 have been modified to reflect that the heirs for whom a guardian or a personal representative has been appointed may consent to an order dispensing with administration and to clarify that the order dispensing with administration has the effect of vesting title in the heirs in accordance with the state's laws of intestate distribution or, if different, the agreement set forth by the heirs as a part of their petition.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The sections in this Chapter replace former OCGA Secs. 44-5-190 through 44-5-198.
   The sections provide that an escheat may occur after four years from the date letters of administration are granted, rather than five years, as provided under former OCGA Sec. 44-5-191.
   These sections also provide that, once it has been determined in the appropriate manner that an escheat has occurred, the determination shall be binding on all heirs.
   Under former OCGA Sec. 44-5-194, an heir could file a claim up to three years following the escheat of property to the County Board of Education.
   OCGA Sec. 44-5-199, which deals with the distribution of property if spouses die intestate within six months of each other, has been modified and appears at Code Sec. 53-2-8.

      <p>
       Subsection (a) carries forward subsection (a) of former OCGA Sec. 53-5-2.
   Subsection (b) carries forward former OCGA Sec. 53-5-1 and omits the 1979 effective date of the application of the year's support statute to widowers.
   This subsection also clarifies that both the spouse and the surviving minor children are entitled to year's support and uses the definition of year's support that appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-5-2.
   The word "money" from that definition is omitted because the word is subsumed in the word "property".
   The omission is not intended to signal that money cannot be awarded.
   Subsection (c) carries forward former OCGA Sec. 53-5-1.1.

         Purpose.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Prime purpose of this statute is to provide a suitable support and maintenance for the widow and minor children, if any, of a father who has died. The state gives the year's support a priority over all debts, even though reduced to judgment, and a priority over the taxes due the sovereign state. Beddingfield v. Old Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 172</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 61</cite> (1932) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Statute has for its purpose the joint support and maintenance of the widow and the minor children. It is based on considerations of public policy; and as the provisions of the statutes in reference thereto are to be construed in favor of the beneficiaries entitled to support, proceedings thereunder are to be construed in favor of the intended beneficiaries of the law. Farmers Bank v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 789</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 195</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002); Ennis v. Ennis, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 665</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 887</cite> (1951);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Beneficent purpose of the provision for a year's support is to see that the widow and minor children, upon the death of the husband and father, shall not be cut adrift, but shall have immediate relief by having set apart funds or property to carry them through the period of a year, taking into consideration the circumstances and standing of the family previous to the death of the husband, and also keeping in view the solvency of the estate. Tilley v. King, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 602</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 281</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Purpose of this statute is to provide a support for a limited period for those members of the family whom the deceased was, while in life, legally bound to support. Woodes v. Morris, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 771</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 704</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An award entered after the 1979 amendment
       
       of year's support statute, but from an estate of a decedent who died before the amendment, is valid. Lawrence v. Lawrence, <cite class="ga_court">254 Ga. 692</cite>, <cite class="app_court">333 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c05s53-5-1" target="_self">53-5-1</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When property is set apart to a widow and the widow's minor children
       
       the property is intended to be used for their joint support and maintenance. Tribble v. Knight, <cite class="ga_court">238 Ga. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">231 S.E.2d 68</cite> (1976) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Entitlement to a year's support award is a matter of status,
       
       and is established by demonstrating that the applicant belongs within one of the classes of intended beneficiaries codified in subsection (b) of former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c05s53-5-2" target="_self">53-5-2</a></cite>. Gentry v. Black, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 569</cite>, <cite class="app_court">351 S.E.2d 188</cite> (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c05s53-5-2" target="_self">53-5-2</a></cite>); Driskell v. Crisler, <cite class="ga_app_court">237 Ga. App. 408</cite>, <cite class="app_court">515 S.E.2d 416</cite> (1999);(decided under former O.C.G.A.
   §
   53-5-2).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When one establishes that he or she is the spouse of the deceased, eligibility for year's support is also established. Gentry v. Black, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 569</cite>, <cite class="app_court">351 S.E.2d 188</cite> (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c05s53-5-2" target="_self">53-5-2</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Entitlement to the right to a year's support is a matter of status.
   It vests upon the death of the spouse. Wigley v. Hambrick, <cite class="ga_app_court">193 Ga. App. 903</cite>, <cite class="app_court">389 S.E.2d 763</cite> (1989), cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">193 Ga. App. 911</cite>, <cite class="app_court">389 S.E.2d 763</cite> (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <b>
         Year's support is designed to care for widow during the first year
        </b>
        following her husband's death. Davis v. Birdsong, 275 F.2d 113 (5th Cir. 1960) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Award of property continues after the expiration of the year,
       
       so long as the property lasts, to be used for the support of the widow during her life and the children until the children are married or reach majority. Tribble v. Knight, <cite class="ga_court">238 Ga. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">231 S.E.2d 68</cite> (1976) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether certain personal items the executor demanded to be returned from a decedent's widow were taken from the marital residence and were thus included in the year's support awarded to the widow, making summary judgment improper.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Law does not require that a father provide for the support of his children after his death. Public policy, of course, favors the support of minor children by the father's estate after his death. Russell v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 556</cite>, <cite class="app_court">276 S.E.2d 641</cite>, overruled on other grounds, Dolvin v.

        Courts favor year's support.
       
       Rakestraw v. Rakestraw, <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 806</cite> (1883) (decided under former Code 1882,
   §
   2571); Cheney v. Cheney, <cite class="ga_court">73 Ga. 66</cite> (1884);(decided under former Code 1882,
   §
   2571).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A year's support is an anomaly and special favorite of legislation and jurisprudence. Rimes v. Graham, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 406</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 443</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Policy of the law is to protect this favored creature of the law
       
       and preserve the property or money set aside as a year's support for that purpose and none other. Rimes v. Graham, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 406</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 443</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Year's support proceeds on the theory that a widow is entitled to it,
       
       regardless of everything else. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="ga_app_court">62 Ga. App. 738</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 710</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Widow of a deceased person is entitled
       
       to a year's support out of his estate, whether he dies testate or intestate. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="ga_app_court">62 Ga. App. 738</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 710</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §

       <p>
        <p>

        Hinge upon which right of year's support hangs
       
       is legal obligation to support during lifetime of deceased. The granting of a year's support is an extension of that obligation beyond the life of the person so obligated, thereby creating a debt of the estate as a necessary expense of administration. Woodes v. Morris, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 771</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 704</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Whenever a year's support is carved out of property disposed of by will, the intention of the testator is defeated pro tanto, and there seems to be no greater antagonism in setting aside as a year's support a part of property which the executors have been directed to keep together than there is in taking property away from a person to whom it has been devised or bequeathed and devoting it to a year's support. In either case, the right to a year's support overrides the testator's instructions. Burch v. Harrell, <cite class="ga_app_court">57 Ga.

       - Considering both the benevolent purposes of the year's support law as well as the clear intent of other laws to protect the rights and claims of minors, the award of a year's support cannot operate to divest a minor heir of the minor's interest in property unless it appears that appropriate steps were taken to protect the minor's interest.

       - To arbitrarily discriminate against the minor child under the application for 12 months' support, and so set apart to the widow the entire assets of an insolvent estate, is such as to render such action nugatory and void; and a judgment based on such action is void as a matter of law. De Jarnette v. De Jarnette, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 204</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 526</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>
       When the appraisers assumed that it was not compulsory on them to set aside any portion of the estate for the benefit of the minor, who was, so far as the record shows, more dependent upon his father's estate for support and maintenance than the widow who received the entire net amount of the insolvent estate, the appraisers acted under a mistake of law causing the judgment thereby obtained to be set aside. De Jarnette v. De Jarnette, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 204</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 526</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - Right to year's support by a widower is a vested right, superior to any encumbrances or debts or other legal entitlement of or to the estate, including bequests to legatees under a testate deceased; it is intended to protect the widow or widower and minor child and children even if the award overrides a testamentary bequest to another.

       - Because the statute expressly states that the year's support for the family may be set aside on the application of the widow, when it is set aside, the provision so made inures to the benefit of the class named in the statute. Accordingly, a widow and three children, who are unmarried minors and members of the family at the time of their father's death, are vested with an undivided one-fourth interest each in the lands set apart under the year's support; and the interest which minors take under a year's support is not divested upon reaching majority; and after the widow's death such children are entitled to their proportionate interest in the unconsumed property; and the proportionate interest of the widow under the year's support goes to her heirs at law upon her death intestate.

      When appraisers have set aside a year's support to a widow, and a caveat thereto has been filed by the administrator of the estate, irrespective of whether the burden of proof rests on the widow or on the administrator, the return of the appraisers makes a prima facie case for the widow, and, in the absence of any evidence tending to show the circumstances and standing of the family before the death of the husband, or as to the solvency of the estate, a verdict in favor of the claimant sustaining the return of the appraisers is demanded as a matter of law.

      <p>
       <p>
      When the appraisers set aside, as a year's support to the widow, property valued at $300.00, and the only evidence in rebuttal of the presumption of the correctness of the year's support was that various sums of money from the sale of property of the estate had been paid to the widow by the administrator, and there was still unpaid an indebtedness against the estate of $150.00, and there was no evidence tending to show that the value of the property set aside as a year's support was in excess of the amount necessary for the support of the widow, estimated according to the circumstances and standing of the family previous to the death of the husband, although the property set aside may have consisted of all of the estate and no assets were left with which to pay the indebtedness, the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption of the correctness of the return of the appraisers.

      When excessiveness of the award of a year's support is the sole issue involved, the return of the appraisers is prima facie correct, the burden is upon the party disputing the return to show otherwise, and in the absence of evidence tending to show the circumstances and standing of the family before the testator's death or as to the solvency of the estate, a verdict sustaining the return is demanded as a matter of law.

       If, in making their return, the appraisers have acted upon insufficient or misleading information as to the property owned by the decedent at the time of decedent's death, or as to any other relevant fact upon which their return may in part be predicated, the law provides a remedy for any person whose legal rights may be injuriously affected thereby, by giving to such person the right to caveat the return; and, upon a trial of the issue thus raised before the ordinary (now probate judge), all the relevant facts may be developed by competent and legal evidence introduced for this purpose, and the return, if incorrect and improper, under the facts disclosed, may be corrected.

       - Statute, which requires that the whole estate, when the estate's value is $1,600.00 or less, be set aside for a year's support, does not inhibit the setting aside of the whole estate when the estate's value exceeds $1,600.00, and the question of whether or not the amount set aside by the appraisers is excessive is one of fact solely for the determination of the jury.

       - Court did not err in weighing into the balance the standard of living which the surviving wife was able to maintain during her marriage to the testator before the life-altering, terminal disability which deprived them both of their accustomed lifestyle since: (1) the statute does not limit consideration to the year before the death or any particular time other than "prior to the death of the testator or intestate"; (2) the right to year's support is founded on status, and the surviving wife enjoyed the status of spouse from 1972 to 1996; and (3) the court was not required to blind itself to the fact that the greatly reduced standard of living was occasioned by the very circumstance which rendered the surviving wife urgently needy in the 12 months subsequent to her husband's death.

       Among the necessary expenses of administration is the provision for the support of the family
      
      of the deceased, which can be accomplished only by an application for a year's support and for each year thereafter that the estate is kept together. White v.

       Year's support is on the same footing as expenses of administration,

       - While a judgment for alimony, payable in monthly installments of money, creating a special lien on land may not be classed as an ordinary debt, being more than such a debt, it is a debt within the meaning of the law, providing that a year's support to the family of the deceased shall be "preferred over all other debts."

        <p>
       - Year's support set apart to a widow and minor children takes precedence, not only over debts due by the decedent, but even of taxes which are due the state; and this is based upon a sound public policy looking to the protection of widows and children out of the estate of a decedent for the space of 12 months, and until such time as they may provide support for the future.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the decedent husband, under a foreclosure of his security deed, acquired title to the property subsequently set apart to his widow as a year's support, after the lien of a paving assessment had attached thereto, her title was subordinate to such lien of the city, and the court did not err in so holding. Paulk v. City of Ocilla, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 69</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 642</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Year's support is superior to liens created by the decedent,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While it is true that, except as to conveyances of title to secure debt, a year's support is superior to liens created by a decedent, or liens arising by operation of law during decedent's ownership, and the widow thus takes the interest of the decedent stripped of all such inferior claims, the title of the widow to the property set apart as a year's support is not superior to liens which had already adhered against the property before the decedent husband acquired the property. Paulk v. City of Ocilla, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 69</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 642</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Annulment of subsequent remarriage.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When wife died in 1982, husband remarried in 1984, husband petitioned for a year's support from estate of deceased former wife's estate, and then husband obtained decree of annulment of second marriage, the trial court erred in excluding from evidence the marriage certificate and the proffered testimony concerning the nature of the actual relationship between petitioner for a year's support and the second woman, since given the financial benefits which petitioner and the woman stood to achieve after the caveat was filed by having their marriage annulled, a manifest injustice could result if caveators were not permitted to go behind the annulment decree in an attempt to prove that the couple had in fact cohabitated as man and wife both before and after the entry of the annulment decree.

        <p>
       - Minor daughter, married at the time of her father's death, and not a member of his household, but living with and supported by her husband, is not entitled to a year's support out of her deceased parent's estate. Having no right to any benefit obtained by the mother, plaintiff was not represented by her or bound by her acts. Therefore, while the other children of the decedent father were so bound, she was not estopped or precluded from attacking the validity of the proceedings. Jones v.

       - In case of testacy, in order to put the widow to an election between the provisions made in her favor in the will and her right to a year's support, such testamentary provision in her favor must be either expressly made in lieu of a year's support, or the intention of the testator to that effect must be deduced by clear and manifest implication from the will, founded on the fact that the claim of year's support would be inconsistent with the will or so repugnant to its provisions as necessarily to defeat them.

        <p>
       Widow's claim for a year's support is not barred by accepting provisions made for her in her husband's will when the will does not show a plain and manifest intention on the part of the testator that the provisions made for the wife should be in lieu of a year's support, although the will provides that the executors conduct certain farming operations and pay the profits thereof to the wife, and that his property be kept "intact" and none of the lands be sold unless absolutely necessary. Burch v. Harrell, <cite class="ga_app_court">57 Ga. App. 514</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 205</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When husband's will provides that all of the property of the testator is devised to the widow and the daughter for life, with remainder over to other children of the testator, and that the property of the testator be kept intact as long as either the widow or daughter should live, the wife's claim for a year's support is inconsistent with and repugnant to the will and necessarily defeats the provisions of the will, in that the allowance of a year's support to the widow will defeat the testamentary scheme of the testator, which was to provide for his wife and daughter and to keep his estate intact so long as either of them should live. Therefore the widow may elect whether she will take a life estate under the will or a year's support. Rogers v. Woods, <cite class="ga_app_court">63 Ga. App. 195</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 404</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When by the will the widow is devised a life estate in all of the testator's property, in order to put her to an election between the provisions of the will in her favor and her right to a year's support, such provisions in the will must be either expressly made in lieu of a year's support, or the intention of the testator to that effect must be deduced by clear and manifest implication from the will, founded on the fact that the claim of year's support would be inconsistent with the will or so repugnant to the will's provisions as necessarily to defeat the provisions. Rogers v. Woods, <cite class="ga_app_court">63 Ga. App. 195</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 404</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the will does not expressly require an election by the widow and there is no conflict of facts requiring submission to a jury, the trial court has the duty as a matter of law to determine if the will can be read to give the "clear and manifest implication" necessary to require an election of the widow. Studstill v. Studstill, <cite class="ga_app_court">130 Ga. App. 803</cite>, <cite class="app_court">204 S.E.2d 496</cite> (1974) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Will which did not provide that the devise of income from real property to the widow was in lieu of a year's support, as might have been done under the statute, does not preclude the widow's right to claim a year's support.

       When the will devised to the widow a life estate in the marital home, and directed payment by the estate of taxes, insurance, and certain maintenance expenses on the family home, and it contained a further provision relative to income to the widow during her lifetime, inasmuch as the unquestioned desire of the testator was to provide certain basic needs to the wife during her lifetime, there was no manifest implication of the will that would require the widow to elect between a year's support and the benefits of the will.

       When after will was probated, widow was entitled, under the will's terms, to receive, use and consume as her own what she testified she had received, this would not bar her right to a year's support or require her to account therefor in having year's support set apart.

        Withdrawal of funds by a widow
       
       from a joint checking account with her deceased husband, after his death, is not tantamount to an election to take under the will of her deceased husband, particularly when there was evidence of excessive medical expenses of the widow following her husband's death.

       - When a widow claims the legacy in lieu of a year's support made under the will and at the same time makes application to the ordinary (now probate judge) for a year's support, any interested person may file a caveat to the return of the appraisers, and may set up as a bar to the allowance of year's support an inconsistent election on the part of the widow, whereby under the provisions of the will she has estopped herself from such an allowance.

       - Testator can make provisions in the testator's will for the benefit of his widow and in lieu of a year's support, and when this is done the widow must elect as between the provisions of the will for her benefit and her right to a year's support.

       When husband's will provides that all of the property of the testator is devised to the widow and the daughter for life, with remainder over to other children of the testator, and that the property of the testator be kept intact as long as either the widow or daughter should live, the wife's claim for a year's support is inconsistent with and repugnant to the will and necessarily defeats the provisions of the will, in that the allowance of a year's support to the widow will defeat the testamentary scheme of the testator, which was to provide for his wife and daughter and to keep his estate intact so long as either of them should live. Therefore, the widow may elect whether she will take a life estate under the will or a year's support. Rogers v. Woods, <cite class="ga_app_court">63 Ga.

       - When a husband as the head of a family has a homestead set apart for himself and wife, and the widow after his death continues upon the property constituting the homestead for a great number of years, enjoying during that period the rents, issues, and profits of the homestead, she will not be allowed, after the expiration of such a time, to take a year's support out of the homestead property, but will be conclusively presumed to have made an election in favor of the enjoyment of the homestead as such, and against the right to have a year's support set apart to her.

        <p>
       In case of testacy, in order to put the widow to an election between the provisions made in her favor in the will and her right to a year's support under the statute, such testamentary provision in her favor must be either expressly made in lieu of year's support, or the intention of the testator to that effect must be deduced by clear and manifest implication from the will, founded on the fact that the claim of year's support would be inconsistent with the will or so repugnant to its provisions as necessarily to defeat them.

   Additionally, the petitioner may elect to have divested property taxes from either the year the decedent died or the year the petition is filed.
   If the petition is filed the year the decedent died, then the petitioner may elect between that year or the year following the filing of the petition.

       It is immaterial who makes the application required by statute
      
      for the 12 months' support for the family of the deceased, so that the representative of the deceased's estate has notice; therefore, such an application by the temporary administrator and the action of the ordinary (now probate judge) thereon is not void as against creditors.

        <p>
       - Probate court erred by allowing the objections of a bank and a decedent's parents solely on the basis of adverse title and by denying a year's support to the widow when the widow failed to meet the resulting burden of proof because the probate court lacked the jurisdiction under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. III, Para. I and O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.15.html#t15c09s15-9-30" target="_blank">15-9-30</a></cite> to determine that the relevant money-market account and real property were not part of the estate; despite the jurisdictional limitation and the lack of an appropriate objection, the probate court proceeded to conduct a hearing as to the amount necessary for the widow's support, thereby inappropriately placing upon the widow a burden of proof that was contrary to O.C.G.A.

       - In order for minor children to take an interest in property set apart as a year's support, it should in some manner appear in the application that it is made in their behalf; and when it affirmatively appears that the application was made by the widow, and that minor children were not referred to therein by name or otherwise, they take no interest in the property set apart.

       - In order for minor children to take an interest in the property set apart for year's support it is not necessary that their names appear in application therefore, nor does the fact that the number of the children was not set out affect their rights. Farmers Bank v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 789</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 195</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When one who is not mentioned in a year's support, either by name or description, that one can take no beneficial interest thereunder; however,
   it is not necessary that the names or number of the minor children appear in the proceeding for them to take an interest in the property set apart. Thus, the minor children take a beneficial interest in property set apart under a year's support proceeding in which a named "widow, and . . . minor children" are designated in various portions of the proceeding. Ennis v. Ennis, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 665</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 887</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Probate court erred by allowing the objections of a bank and a decedent's parents solely on the basis of adverse title and by denying a year's support to the widow when the widow failed to meet the resulting burden of proof because the probate court lacked the jurisdiction under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. III, Para. I and O.C.G.A.
   §

        <p>
       - When co-executors claimed that the probate court erred by failing to consider the value of the room and board the decedent's spouse received in lieu of wages from the spouse's own employer and that it improperly assumed that the spouse alone would need an amount of money equal to the amount the spouse and the decedent together had spent on living expenses in the last year of decedent's life but the co-executors failed to include in the record on appeal the transcript of the hearing on the decedent's spouse's petition for a year's support, there was no basis in the record for the court to reverse under O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Undisputed evidence demanded that in light of the decedent's spouse's resources, the spouse's application for a year's support had to be denied and a directed verdict had to be granted against the spouse and in favor of the decedent's children; the evidence showed that during the 12 months following decedent's death, the spouse received $126,000 in cash from the decedent's assets outside of probate and received
   $22,019 in income for a total of $148,019. Allgood v. Allgood, <cite class="ga_app_court">263 Ga. App. 177</cite>, <cite class="app_court">587 S.E.2d 377</cite> (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Superior court's order reversing a year's support award in the amount of $30,000, along with title to a vehicle and antique furniture, and instead enforcing an oral agreement for an equal division of the assets of the estate after payment of all expenses was proper as: (1) the wife failed to testify as to the amount of money needed to maintain the standard of living for a period of 12 months after the decedent husband died; (2) the wife presented no evidence of any income earned during the marriage; (3) no evidence documenting the wife's medical expenses incurred during the marriage was presented; and (4) the wife's testimony about the decline in the standard of living was relevant under O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because it appeared from the testimony that a widow's standard of living was improved after receiving an award of year's support after the decedent's death, and that the widow had the resources independent of the year's support to afford those improvements, the award was erroneously entered; thus, the trial court erred in denying a motion for involuntary dismissal filed by the decedent's only child. Anderson v. Westmoreland, <cite class="ga_app_court">286 Ga. App. 561</cite>, <cite class="app_court">649 S.E.2d 820</cite> (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 676 (Ga. 2007).

       - Property duly set apart to the widow, or widow and minor child, of an intestate as a year's support vests in them, and is not subject to be administered as a part of the estate of the deceased husband or father. Holamon v. Jenkins, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga. App. 129</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 262</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When property owned by one at the time of one's death is set apart to one's minor children as a year's support, the title thereto vests in such children share and share alike, and a child's arrival at majority does not divest his or her legal interest. Pardue Medicine Co. v. Pardue, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 516</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1942) ??? (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a year's support was set aside to the widow and three minor children jointly under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1002, the title thereto vested in them for their joint support and maintenance, and the other children had no interest therein. When the minor children married or attained their majority, the right of support and maintenance from the property set aside as a year's support belonged to the widow alone as long as the property lasted or as she lived, and she was entitled to its use and control. She could sell the property for her maintenance and support. The children who have attained their majority have no right to participate in its consumption or its control. King v. King, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 811</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 465</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When uncontradicted evidence showed that the application for a year's support made by widow was not admitted to record, and there was no judgment by the ordinary (now probate judge) making the return of the appraisers the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court), title to the property did not vest in the widow under a valid year's support proceeding. Miles v. Blanton, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 754</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E.2d 273</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Interest of a minor child in the estate awarded is not divested upon the child reaching majority, and upon the death of the child's mother, the child is entitled to the child's proportionate interest in such of the property as remains unconsumed. Barber v. Dunn, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 134</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E.2d 572</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Title to property set apart to a widow and child or children,
       
       as a year's support vests in the family to the exclusion of all debts, "except as otherwise specially provided" by law. Bank of Hampton v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 532</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 508</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>
       - When property is set aside to a widow and minor children in gross, the widow and minor children become owners of the property in common, and share equally in the title. Walden v. Walden, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 182</cite>, <cite class="app_court">12 S.E.2d 345</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When an application for a year's support is made by a widow for herself and her minor child, the law contemplates that an award shall be made to such widow and minor child in gross, and not that awards shall be made to them separately; so that, although the legal title will vest in them share and share alike, the use of the entire property shall be a joint one for the support of both the mother and the child, and of neither to the exclusion of the other, so long as the widow lives and until the child marries or reaches majority. McCommons v. Reid, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 500</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - If necessary, the property awarded to a widow and minor child may be consumed or exhausted, and so long as it lasts, it will be subject to exclusive use by the widow during her life, after the child marries or reaches majority. McCommons v. Reid, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 500</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - When a widow was awarded her deceased husband's real property as a year's support, the property was subject to sheriff's sale for the widow's personal debts. Martin v. Jones, <cite class="ga_court">266 Ga. 156</cite>, <cite class="app_court">465 S.E.2d 274</cite> (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Because the law does not confer upon the appraisers the power to direct that the fund be paid to a widow over a period of time,
       
       husband's estate is not held together during the time that the fund is in the hands of husband's legal representative subject to the use of the widow; estate of the husband is divested of any interest in the money. May v. Braddock, <cite class="ga_app_court">92 Ga. App. 302</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E.2d 539</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When property is set apart as a year's support for the benefit of the widow alone, the fee vests in her, and she can make a testamentary disposition of the unconsumed portion thereof; and, accordingly, the petition of another seeking to recover an interest in the property as an heir at law failed to set forth a cause of action. Hiers v. Striplin, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 293</cite>, <cite class="app_court">79 S.E.2d 539</cite> (1954) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Judgment setting apart a year's support is not void on the ground that the appraisers have not filed with their report a plat of the land set apart. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       When no caveat to widow's application for support was filed, and citation had issued and been published as required by law, a court of equity would not set aside the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) for irregularities. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       Judgment setting apart a year's support to a widow and her minor children has the same binding force and effect as that of any other judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction and cannot be collaterally attacked.

        Widow's application for year's support is not barred by executor's deed of assent
       
       as to the property conveyed therein by operation of this statute. Anderson v. Groover, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">247 S.E.2d 851</cite> (1978) (decided under Ga. L. 1972, p. 731,

        An executor's assent to devise does not come within the meaning of this statute,
       
       which was intended to offer protection to third-party purchasers of property in an estate against claims for year's support, and was not intended to exempt devises and legacies from year's support. Anderson v. Groover, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">247 S.E.2d 851</cite> (1978) (decided under Ga. L. 1972, p. 731,
   §
   1).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Widow of the decedent was entitled to a year's support
       
       since the estate still contained over $45,000.00 and no action had been taken by the executor to obtain the court's permission to distribute those funds to the minor child of the decedent; the executor's attempt to designate the funds for the minor by purchasing a cashier's check after the application was filed by the widow was of no avail. Evans v. Evans, <cite class="ga_app_court">236 Ga. App. 896</cite>, <cite class="app_court">514 S.E.2d 74</cite> (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - When the purchaser of land under a bond for title or other executory contract of sale agrees therein to pay the purchase money thereof and the taxes thereon, and the purchaser is put in possession of the land, and the equitable interest of the purchaser is set apart as a year's support to his widow and minor children, the widow would have to pay off the purchase-money debt, including the taxes which accrued on the property, before she would be entitled to enjoy such equitable interest against the claim of the state and county for taxes due on the land.

       Year's support under former Civil Code 1910,

So, when the vendor conveys the property to another, and takes a mortgage to secure the purchase money, the claim of the vendor is superior to a year's support. Beaton v.

       When an agreement is made for the furnishing of money to pay for personalty added or to be added to real estate as improvements thereto and it is specifically agreed that such described goods whether affixed to the premises or not, are and should remain personal property and that the lender has security title to and a security interest in those goods until the note is fully paid, the language in such agreement is sufficient to meet the requirements of this statute that it was executed and delivered for the purpose of securing the debt for such purchase money.

        Only a mortgage expressly made for the balance of the purchase money

       The approval of the probate court required by subsection (b) of Code Section 53-3-19 shall be obtained in the following manner: The surviving spouse shall petition the probate court, stating the purposes of the proposed conveyance or encumbrance and describing the property the spouse desires to convey or encumber, the nature of the proposed conveyance or encumbrance, and the names, last known addresses, and ages of the children for whose benefit the year's support was set apart.

Not less than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing, personal service shall be made on each child for whose benefit the year's support was set apart who has attained the age of 18 at the time the petition is filed. If the surviving spouse does not know and cannot easily ascertain the addresses of any of the children, service shall be made by publishing notice of the date and purpose of the hearing one time and by posting a copy of the notice at the courthouse not less than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing. In addition to publication, the probate court shall mail a copy of the notice to the last known address of each child whose current address is unknown, not less than ten days prior to the date set for such hearing.

      <p>
       This section carries over portions of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-9.
   The second sentence of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-9(b), which required close scrutiny of a will that excluded the testator's spouse or children, is not carried forward because the laws relating to undue influence, fraud, and testamentary capacity cover such situations and because the Georgia courts have held that that sentence could be evaded by leaving a spouse or child some nominal sum, such as $1.00.
   The exclusion of the second sentence is not meant to signal a change in the law or policy of the state.

         Close scrutiny when wife or child excluded.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Under the general rules of evidence, every presumption is in favor of the probate of a will after it is shown that the testator was of sound mind and disposing memory at the time the will was executed; but under the statutory provisions, if it appears that the testator has excluded his wife, and that he has no child, there is but little, if any, presumption in favor of the propounder; for the will is to be closely scrutinized, and upon the slightest evidence of aberration of intellect, or collusion, or fraud, or any undue influence or unfair dealing, probate should be refused. Rules as to the nature of proof and the quantum of evidence necessary for a caveator to produce and present to the court and jury, in ordinary cases of probate of wills, can have no application in the face of the declaration that probate of a will of the class referred to should be refused upon the slightest evidence of any of the ingredients of operative causes set forth in law. The law does not define the term "slightest evidence," but it is the superlative degree of the adjective "slight," and therefore must mean very slight. Deans v. Deans, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 691</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3832); Bowman v. Bowman, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 796</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 298</cite> (1949);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-106).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When one bequeaths one's entire estate to strangers to the exclusion of one's spouse and children, upon the slightest evidence of the aberration of intellect, or collusion or fraud, or any undue influence or unfair dealing, probate should be refused. Crawford v. Crawford, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 369</cite>, <cite class="app_court">128 S.E.2d 53</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Evidence of aberration of intellect would, when coupled with the fact that the testator bequeathed the testator's entire estate to a stranger to the exclusion of an afflicted child as well as the testator's other children, make a question for the jury to weigh the testimony and determine whether or not the testator had the mental capacity to make a will at the time of the will's execution. English v. Shivers, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 737</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 443</cite> (1965) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - Trial court did not err when the court applied the law in place before the 1998 probate code was adopted to determine whether a husband and wife had a contract not to revoke their joint and mutual will because the issue was not the propriety of the devises in the will but whether the husband and wife had a contract not to revoke the will; the 1998 probate code only applies to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 1998, so it would not apply to any contract allegedly made in 1980. Davis v. Parris, <cite class="ga_court">289 Ga. 201</cite>, <cite class="app_court">710 S.E.2d 757</cite> (2011).

        Statute expressly authorizes a testator to give one's entire estate to strangers,
       
       to the exclusion of one's spouse and children. Marshall v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">231 Ga. 415</cite>, <cite class="app_court">202 S.E.2d 94</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Word "strangers" in legal contemplation
       
       has a meaning distinctly different from the meaning in common usage or parlance. For instance, one who is not a party to a contract is generally referred to as a stranger to the contract. The word is often used in a legal sense to convey the meaning converse to "privy" or "privity." Deans v. Deans, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 664</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 691</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>
       - When a father, who has no wife, by will leaves one's entire estate to persons other than one's child, one is leaving it to "strangers" within the meaning of the law. Deans v.

       Statute expressly authorizes a testator to give one's entire estate to strangers, who might be one's concubines, to the exclusion of one's spouse and children. Hood v.

        Common-law spouse of a testator is not a stranger
       
       within the meaning of the law, and the "slightest evidence of aberration of intellect" test of the law does not apply. Yuzamas v. Yuzamas, <cite class="ga_court">241 Ga. 577</cite>, <cite class="app_court">247 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - Statute which formed a distinct class to protect - the wife and children of a testator - there is no reference or provision for the husband, and therefore no law upon which the husband could caveat his wife's will, except those provided for any other heirs. Deans v. Deans, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 664</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 691</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - When one who has been altogether excluded in a will establishes the fact that one is a child of the testator, the trial judge must give in charge to the jury the rule of this statute.

        <p>

        Provisions of this statute have no application where
       
       testator made a nominal bequest to his daughter, since daughter was not altogether excluded in the will. Lee v. Boyer, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 27</cite>, <cite class="app_court">120 S.E.2d 757</cite> (1961) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Jury must determine whether circumstances require grant or refusal of probate.
       
       Under the provisions of this statute, it is for the jury to determine whether there are any circumstances, even very slight, which make it the duty of the jury to refuse probate of a will. Deans v. Deans, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 664</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 691</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - Probate court erred in finding a genuine issue of material fact regarding a will contestant's beneficiary status because although there could be a genuine issue of fact as to the contestant's status as the testator's daughter, resolution of that issue was unnecessary in determining the daughter's status under the will, which clearly and unambiguously expressed the testator's intent that only the daughters born of the testator's marriage would share as children thereunder; the plain terms of the will clearly reflected the testator's intent to exclude the contestant because the contestant was not mentioned in any portion of the will, as contrasted with the daughters, who were specifically designated as the testator's "two living children," were named co-executors, and were named as trustees of respective trusts created for each of them from the family trust, and by defining the term "children" as "lawful blood descendants," the testator demonstrated the testator's intent that the testator's child born out of wedlock not be included as a beneficiary under the will.

       - Trial court did not err when the court applied the law in place before the 1998 probate code was adopted to determine whether a husband and wife had a contract not to revoke their joint and mutual will because the issue was not the propriety of the devises in the will but whether the husband and wife had a contract not to revoke the will; the 1998 probate code only applies to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 1998, so it would not apply to any contract allegedly made in 1980.

       - Only after a will is probated will rights in property be fixed retrospectively with reference to the law and factual circumstances existing at the time of the testator's death. Woodall v. Pharr, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 692</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 645</cite> (1969), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 1</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E.2d 404</cite> (1970) (decided under former Code 1933,

        It is necessary to probate a will before the will can be recognized
       
       as an instrument affecting rights in property. Woodall v. Pharr, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga.

        Will is to be taken as speaking from the time of the death of the testator.

       <p>
        <p>

        To take effect
       
       a will not only must be a validly executed instrument disposing of the testator's property at the testator's death, but it must remain so right up to its effective date, the testator's death. Lawson v. Hurt, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">125 S.E.2d 480</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,

     <p>
      No particular form is necessary to constitute a will. To determine whether an instrument is a will, the test is the intention of the maker to be gathered from the whole instrument, read in light of the surrounding circumstances. If the intention is to convey a present interest, though the possession is postponed until after death, the instrument is not a will. If the intention is to convey an interest accruing and having effect only at death, the instrument is a will.

       - A paper reciting: "I [the maker], being in good health and of sound and disposing mind and memory, do make and publish this my last will and testament, hereby revoking all former wills by me at any time heretofore made," and containing an attestation clause reciting that the paper is "signed, sealed, published, and delivered by the" maker "as and for her last will and testament," and that the witnesses, four in number, have subscribed their names in the maker's presence and in the presence of each other, and which at the time of the paper's execution is delivered to the party for whose benefit the paper is made as the will of the maker, though the devising or granting clause may contain language appropriate to a deed in some respects, is not a deed, but is an instrument testamentary in character. Page v. Jones, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 485</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 63</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the owner of property transfers the property inter vivos to another person in trust, the disposition is not testamentary merely because the interest of the beneficiary does not take effect in enjoyment or possession before the death of the settler, or because in addition the settler reserves power to revoke or modify the trust; in such a case the trust is created in the lifetime of the settler and the mere fact that the settler can destroy the trust or alter the trust does not make the disposition testamentary, although if the trust were not to arise until the settler's death the intended trust would be testamentary. Wilder v. Howard, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 426</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 199</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If an instrument in the form of a deed conveys an estate in praesenti, although the right of possession be postponed, the instrument is a deed; but, if the instrument conveys no present estate or right, but is an attempt to convey an estate or right in the property upon the death of the grantor, the instrument is testamentary in character and will not be upheld as a deed. Smith v. Thomas, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 396</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 278</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-102).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If deed were testamentary in character, it would be of no effect, since it was not executed in the manner which would entitle it to probate as a will. Childs v. Mitchell, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 542</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 216</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       If the intention by the grantor is to convey a present estate, although possession be postponed until the death of the grantor, the instrument is a deed. Martin v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 600</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E.2d 406</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Deed containing this reservation: "This conveyance is made with the distinct reservation by the grantor that she retains for herself an exclusive control of all of said lands as long as she may live, and to have the right to use them as her own and as she sees fit, including the working and selling of timber during the remainder of her natural life," is a warranty deed, and not a will.

       An instrument containing a reservation by a grantor, who reserved a life estate, of the right to dispose of the land that the grantor owned during the grantor's lifetime is a deed rather than an attempted will.

        <p>
       - In a will contest action between a goddaughter and a first cousin, the trial court properly denied the challenging first cousin's motion for a directed verdict because the testimony of the goddaughter, viewed in her favor, supported the finding both that the testatrix intended the two documents at issue together to express her desired dispository scheme and that the two documents were presented together for attestation; thus, the evidence supported the jury's finding that the two documents together did in fact create a valid will.

        When testamentary capacity is the issue, capacity must be determined by
       
       the condition of the mind at the time of the execution of the will. Hill v. Deal, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 42</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 858</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Though, as tending to illustrate the condition of the mind, evidence may be received as to what was the mental capacity at a prior or a subsequent time, yet if it be certain from all the testimony that at the time of the execution of the instrument there was no want of testamentary capacity, the instrument offered will not be refused probate on the ground of lack of sound and disposing mind and memory. Hill v. Deal, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 42</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 858</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although evidence as to the mental capacity at a time prior or subsequent to the execution of the will may be shown to illustrate the condition of the testator's mind, still the controlling question to be determined, when testamentary capacity is the issue, is whether the testator had sufficient testamentary capacity at the time of executing the will. Spivey v. Spivey, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Neither age and physical impairments, nor declarations made subsequent to the execution of the will and contrary to the will's terms are sufficient alone to raise issues of mental incapacity. Irvin v. Askew, <cite class="ga_court">241 Ga. 565</cite>, <cite class="app_court">246 S.E.2d 682</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - On the trial of an issue of devisavit vel non, whether the alleged testator had mental capacity to make a will at the time of signing the paper is a question for decision by the jury, and a witness cannot testify as to such legal conclusion. Morgan v. Bell, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 897</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>

        Capacity to make a contract is not identical
       
       with the mental capacity necessary to make a valid will; a person with mental capacity less than that required to make a contract may have that degree of mental capacity necessary to make a valid will. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Understanding nature of testament.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Person has testamentary capacity who understands the nature of a testament or will, viz., that it is a disposition of property to take effect after death, and by one who is capable of remembering generally the property subject to disposition and the persons related to that person by the ties of blood and of affection, and also of conceiving and expressing by words, written or spoken, or by signs, or by both, any intelligible scheme of disposition. If the testator has sufficient intellect to enable the testator to have a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of the testator's property, this will suffice. Morgan v. Bell, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 897</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201); Spivey v. Spivey, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1947);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Testimony as to mental status is necessarily opinionative,
       
       and the law requires that before a will can be probated, and subscribing witnesses shall be inquired of as to apparent capacity or noncapacity; the fact that a witness witnesses a will qualifies the witness to give an opinion on that subject. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 679</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the testimony of both expert and nonexpert witnesses was insufficient to overcome the positive testimony of two of the subscribing witnesses, the testimony of the other subscribing witness being inconclusive, that at the time the will was executed the testator apparently had testamentary capacity, the evidence demanded a verdict in favor of the propounder. Spivey v. Spivey, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When there is an issue as to the testamentary capacity of the testator, the opinion as to the sanity of the testator may be given in evidence by a witness who attested the will without first stating the facts upon which one bases such opinion. Brooker v. Brooker, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 117</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When although the pleadings raised an issue as to testamentary capacity of the testator, not a single witness testified that the testator was not of sound and disposing memory at the time of executing or acknowledging the will, there was no evidence to carry this issue to the jury. Brooker v. Brooker, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 117</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Presumption favoring testamentary capacity is necessarily a rebuttable presumption,
       
       and the capacity of the testator is always a proper subject of inquiry. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 679</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Burden is on the propounder to show the factum of the will,
       
       free and voluntary action, and apparent testamentary capacity, and when this is shown, together with the presumption of testamentary capacity which exists in the absence of proof, a prima facie case for the propounder is made out. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 679</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201); Johnson v. Sullivan, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 663</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 640</cite> (1981);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the presumption in favor of testamentary capacity exists, the presumption alone is not sufficient to make out for the propounder a prima facie case. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 679</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201); Johnson v. Sullivan, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 663</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 640</cite> (1981);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Law, in its zealousness always to safeguard the rights of a deceased testator, although presuming testamentary capacity, deems it wise not to rely solely upon that presumption, but to make inquiry into the immediate circumstances of the execution of the will from those who were present at the time. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 679</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Charge that the presumption is always in favor of a mental capacity to make a will, where elsewhere in the charge the jury was instructed that the burden was on the propounder to establish the factum of the will, that it was freely and voluntarily made, and that the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make a will, as a prerequisite to the making out by the propounder of a prima facie case was not error. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 679</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

        COMMENT

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section carries over the concepts of former OCGA Secs. 53-2-21, 53-2-23, and 53-2-25.
   Former Code Sec. 53-2-21 described the capacity necessary to make a will as including a "decided and rational desire" on the part of the testator: "decided, as distinguished from the wavering, vacillating fancies of a distempered intellect, and rational, as distinguished from the ravings of a madman, the silly pratings of an idiot, the childish whims of imbecility, or the excited vagaries of a drunkard."
   The changes from the former Code section are not intended to change the standard for determining testamentary capacity, but rather to eliminate from the Code language that was merely illustrative and, in some cases, outdated.
   The terms "insane" and "monomania," while of uncertain medical meaning, are retained because they have been defined or referred to often in Georgia case law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former OCGA Sec. 53-2-24 is not carried forward so that individuals who are suffering from disabilities such as hearing or speech impairments or visual impairments may make wills in the same way as individuals who do not suffer from such impairments.

        Capacity to make a contract is not identical with the mental capacity necessary to make a valid will;
       
       a person with mental capacity less than that required to make a contract may have that degree of mental capacity necessary to make a valid will. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-204).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Person has testamentary capacity who understands the nature of a testament or will,
       
       viz., that it is a disposition of property to take effect after death, and by one who is capable of remembering generally the property subject to disposition and the persons related to that person by the ties of blood and of affection, and also of conceiving and expressing by words, written or spoken, or by signs, or by both, any intelligible scheme of disposition. If the testator has sufficient intellect to enable the testator to have a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of the testator's property, this will suffice. Griffin v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 152</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E. 828</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-205); Morgan v. Bell, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 897</cite> (1939); Fowler v. Fowler, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 53</cite>, <cite class="app_court">28 S.E.2d 458</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-204); Spivey v. Spivey, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1947);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-205);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-205).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       As tending to illustrate the mental condition at that time, evidence of such condition at other times may be received; but when it is sought to establish testamentary incapacity by such evidence, it does not controvert the positive testimony of the subscribing witnesses unless it would be proof of testamentary incapacity at the time the will was signed. Anderson v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 464</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 807</cite> (1954) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-204).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In order to execute a will it is necessary, as a minimum, that the testator have a rational desire as to the disposition of the testator's property. It takes a greater intellect to execute a deed. Joiner v. Joiner, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-204).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the fact that a person did or did not become insolvent, displease one's family, or become dependent as the result of signing a deed is not evidence of mental capacity, yet if his or her mental capacity was so impaired that he or she did not know at the time whether such would or could be the case, then such person would not have the capacity to make a will much less the capacity to execute a deed. Joiner v. Joiner, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Despite the fact that the testator was old and frail, the testator did not lack testamentary capacity to change the will, disinheriting the testator's son. Harper v. Harper, <cite class="ga_court">274 Ga. 542</cite>, <cite class="app_court">554 S.E.2d 454</cite> (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        To establish incapacity in a grantor,
       
       one must be shown to have been, at the time, non compos mentis, in the legal acceptation of that term; which means not a partial but an entire loss of understanding. Joiner v. Joiner, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Weak have the same rights as the prudent and strong-minded
       
       to dispose of their property by will, and anything less than a total absence of mind does not destroy that capacity. Griffin v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 152</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E. 828</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Weak have the same rights as the strong-minded
       
       to dispose of their property by will, and anything less than a total absence of mind does not destroy that capacity. If the testator has sufficient intellect to enable the testator to have a rational desire as to the disposition of one's property, this is sufficient. The condition of the testator's mind at the time of the execution of the will determines whether the testator can make a valid will. Anderson v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 464</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 807</cite> (1954) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When a testator, who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, executed one will in February 2004 and another shortly before the testator's death in October 2004, there was sufficient evidence to support a jury's finding that the testator lacked testamentary capacity at the time the testator executed the October will; there was evidence that the testator was taking medication that had as possible side effects hallucination, disorientation, impaired mental performance, and confusion; that two days before the will was executed, the testator had difficulty completing sentences, was somewhat forgetful, and denied having siblings; and that on the day the will was executed, a witness, who described the testator as "morphined up," saw a beneficiary of the will repeatedly administer medicine to the testator via an eyedropper used to administer narcotics.

       - In a will contest, it was error to grant propounders' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as there was some evidence that the 95-year-old decedent lacked testamentary capacity, including expert testimony that the decedent suffered from some degree of dementia and testimony that the decedent appeared confused and spoke of deceased relations as if the relatives were alive.

       When to the probate of a will a caveat has been filed on the grounds of testamentary incapacity or undue influence, and there is doubt as to the extent of weakness of intellect, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the disposition of the estate may be considered by the jury. In the trial of such issue the source from which the property disposed of by the will came into the decedent's possession may be shown. Shaw v. Fehn, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 661</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 406</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       On the propounding of a will, where the question is insanity, monomania, or undue influence, the unreasonableness of the disposition of the will is always a question to be considered by the jury. A reasonable disposition of property, without more, strongly indicates mental capacity to make a will. An unreasonable disposition of property may indicate a lack of mental capacity to make a will. It follows that a reasonable or unreasonable disposition of property, regardless of the nature of the insanity or inability alleged, should be given much consideration by the jury, if any doubt exists from the evidence as to the testator's ability to make the alleged will. Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 391</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E.2d 329</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       The reasonableness, or unreasonableness of a will, while a legitimate subject of investigation by a jury in case of doubt as to the testator's capacity to make a will, is not to be considered until such a doubt has been first created by other evidence.

       - Evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the trial court to find, as a matter of fact, that the decedent had the necessary mental capacity to revoke a 1988 will because the record showed that the relevant circumstances had changed significantly in the 16 years since the execution of the 1988 will, giving the decedent good reasons to want to revoke the old will such as several people listed in the 1988 will having died, including both of the co-executors named.

       - An incapacity to contract is not inconsistent with the capacity to make a will. Griffin v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 152</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E. 828</cite> (1936), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 443</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E. 746</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Capacity to make a contract is not identical with the mental capacity necessary to make a valid will; a person with mental capacity less than that required to make a contract may have that degree of mental capacity necessary to make a valid will. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>

       It takes a greater quantum or higher degree of mentality to make a contract than it does to make a will. Anderson v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 464</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 807</cite> (1954) (decided under former Code 1933,

       While the fact that a person did or did not become insolvent, displease one's family, or become dependent as the result of signing a deed is not evidence of mental capacity, yet if his or her mental capacity was so impaired that he or she did not know at the time whether such would or could be the case, then such person would not have the capacity to make a will, much less the capacity to execute a deed. Joiner v. Joiner, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Issue of mental capacity to make a will is confined
       
       to the mental condition of the testator at the time the will was executed. Scott v. Gibson, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 503</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 51</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Not only may an insane person make a will during a lucid interval, but a person may be feeble and suffering from an illness that today might cause sufficient reason to be wanting, and yet tomorrow or at another time even in the same day sufficient reason (mental capacity) would be present. Scott v. Gibson, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 503</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 51</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although evidence as to the mental capacity at a time prior or subsequent to the execution of the will may be shown to illustrate the condition of the testator's mind, still the controlling question to be determined, when testamentary capacity is the issue, is whether the testator had sufficient testamentary capacity at the time of executing the will. Spivey v. Spivey, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        To make one incapable of making a will from insanity
       
       there must be a "total deprivation of reason." However old, feeble, weak-minded, capricious, or notionate one may be, if one "be able to have a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of his property," one is not wanting in testamentary capacity.

       - In a dispute concerning the distribution of the decedent's estate, the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the verdict finding that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity because there was no evidence that the decedent lacked the ability to form a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of the decedent's property; and the caveators expressly disclaimed that the decedent was insane or suffered from monomania, and, instead, they merely argued that the decedent suffered from delusions; however, the caveators' claim nevertheless failed as the case law was clear that not every delusion deprived one of testamentary capacity, rather, it had to be an insane delusion, but none of the decedent's delusions were insane ones.

       Law does not withhold from the aged, the feeble, the weak-minded,
      
      the capricious, or the notionate, the right to make a will, provided such person has a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of one's property. Hill v.

      Weak have the same rights as the strong-minded to dispose of their property by will, and anything less than a total absence of mind does not destroy that capacity. If the testator has sufficient intellect to enable the testator to have a rational desire as to the disposition of the testator's property, this is sufficient. The condition of the testator's mind at the time of the execution of the will determines whether the testator can make a valid will. Anderson v.

       Attention is to be given, not so much to the abstract state of the mind,
      
      as to the mind's capacity for the precise thing in hand. For a man may say and do things which a medical man would take as evidence of insanity, and yet it may be that one is nevertheless able to have a decided rational desire as to the disposition of one's property.

       Petition to probate the will was properly granted as the decedent had testamentary capacity because the evidence did not show a total absence of mind and the attorneys who took part in the preparation and/or execution of the will testified that the decedent appeared to understand what the decedent was doing and to be of sound mind when the decedent signed the document.

       - In a probate case, when the decedent was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1973, the probate court did not err in denying the sister's caveat and in admitting the will to probate as the decedent did not lack testamentary capacity because the decedent had enough knowledge about the nature and extent of the decedent's estate to sustain a finding that the decedent had a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of the decedent's property; the medical records reflected that the decedent's state of mind improved close in time to the execution of the will; and, even if there was some evidence that the decedent was not lucid at times, the record did not demand a finding that the decedent was not lucid when the decedent executed the will.

        <p>
       - Monomania is a mental disease; an insane delusion such as will deprive one of testamentary capacity. Monomania must be distinguished from an expressed desire to exclude a person from a will because of ill will, bad judgment, animosity, prejudice, or other conditions of mind which can be coexistent with sanity. Russell v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 421</cite>, <cite class="app_court">283 S.E.2d 879</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Burden is on the propounder to show the factum of the will,
      
      free and voluntary action, and apparent testamentary capacity, and when this is shown, together with the presumption of testamentary capacity which exists in the absence of proof, a prima facie case for the propounder is made out.

      <p>
       <p>
      When the witnesses, both for the propounder and the caveator, testified to the effect that the deceased had perfectly normal periods up until a very short time before death, almost all the facts relied upon to establish the mental incapacity of the deceased occurred after the will was executed, most of them very shortly before death, the only doctor who testified said that the next year after the will was executed the deceased was perfectly normal, and on the date the will was executed, the deceased went to the office of the deceased's attorney and in a perfectly intelligent manner furnished the information for the preparation of the will, all of the subscribing witnesses testifying that the deceased was perfectly normal the day the will was executed, the evidence was not sufficient to carry the burden placed by law upon the caveator. Orr v. Orr, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 431</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 209</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Upon the trial of an issue arising upon the propounding of a will and a caveat thereto, the burden, in the first instance, is upon the propounder of the alleged will to make out a prima facie case, by showing the factum of the will and that at the time of the will's execution the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make the will, and, in making the will, acted freely and voluntarily. When this is done, the burden of proof shifts to the caveator. Cornelius v. Crosby, <cite class="ga_court">243 Ga. 26</cite>, <cite class="app_court">252 S.E.2d 455</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code 1933,

       While the presumption in favor of testamentary capacity exists,

      </p>
      <p>

      There is no less reason to presume sane action in the execution of a will than in other instances of human relations and conduct. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 679</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - In a will contest, the caveator was properly prevented from cross-examining the executor as to the effect of the will's in terrorem clause as the uncontroverted testimony showed that the testator was of sound mind and was not influenced by the desires of others, and evidence as to the effect of the forfeiture provision would not have been probative of either undue influence or the lack of testamentary capacity.

        Testimony as to mental status is necessarily opinionative,

       When there was no testimony of any expert witnesses showing or tending to show mental incapacity of the testator, and the testimony of every nonexpert witness to that effect was based on acts, conduct, and sayings of the testator which did not within themselves show mental incapacity to make a will, such testimony was therefore insufficient to support a verdict finding for the caveators.

       When the testimony of both expert and nonexpert witnesses was insufficient to overcome the positive testimony of two of the subscribing witnesses, the testimony of the other subscribing witness being inconclusive, that at the time the will was executed the testator apparently had testamentary capacity, the evidence demanded a verdict in favor of the propounder.

       As tending to illustrate the mental condition at that time, evidence of such condition at other times may be received; but when it is sought to establish testamentary incapacity by such evidence, it does not controvert the positive testimony of the subscribing witnesses unless it would be proof of testamentary incapacity at the time the will was signed.

        General rule is that a charge on legal principles must be adjusted
       
       to the pleadings and the evidence; hence when there was no evidence which would have authorized a verdict on the issue of monomania (because of testator's belief that beneficiary was the testator's illegitimate son) the failure to charge on that subject was not error. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When all that the testimony of the witnesses for the caveator amounted to was that the testator was highly eccentric and that the testator had delusional ideas that people were trying to harm the testator, and the uncontroverted evidence showed that the testator not only conducted the testator's brokerage business while a patient in a mental institution, but that the testator continued to conduct the business until the testator's death approximately two years after execution of the will, and that the testator was not suffering from monomania about the testator's money, the caveator did not carry the burden of proving lack of testamentary capacity.

      A will must be freely and voluntarily executed. A will is not valid if anything destroys the testator's freedom of volition, such as fraudulent practices upon the testator's fears, affections, or sympathies; misrepresentation; duress; or undue influence whereby the will of another is substituted for the wishes of the testator.

         What constitutes undue influence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Undue influence, to invalidate a will, must amount to force or fear and must, in effect, make the will the mental offspring of some other person, and be operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will is executed. It must destroy the free agency of the testator and constrain the testator to do what is against the testator's will, but what the testator is unable to refuse. Trust Co. v. Ivey, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 629</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 648</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208); Crews v. Crews, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 459</cite>, <cite class="app_court">134 S.E.2d 27</cite> (1963);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Undue influence in procuring a will to be made must amount to moral coercion; it must destroy the free agency of the testator and constrain the testator to do what is against the testator's will but which the testator is unable to refuse. Griffin v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 152</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E. 828</cite> (1936), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 443</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E. 746</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The undue influence which the law contemplates as a ground to invalidate a properly executed will must be such as amounts to fraud, deceit, force, or coercion, destroying the testator's free agency. It must also be operative at the time the will is executed, and not merely at some other time. Boland v. Aycock, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 327</cite>, <cite class="app_court">12 S.E.2d 319</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Undue influence or fraud, to invalidate the will, must amount to force or fear and must, in effect, make the will the mental offspring of some other person, and must be operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will is executed. Butler v. Lashley, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 508</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Undue influence which operates to invalidate a will is such influence as amounts either to deception, or to force and coercion, destroying free agency. Butler v. Lashley, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 508</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208); Ehlers v. Rheinberger, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 226</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1948); Morgan v. Ivey, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 850</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E.2d 833</cite> (1967), for comment, see 11 Ga. B.J. 348 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208); Sauls v. Estate of Avant, <cite class="ga_app_court">143 Ga. App. 469</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1977) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       To be sufficient to invalidate a will on the ground of undue influence, the evidence must show that such influence amounted to fear, force, overpersuasion, or coercion, to the extent of destroying the free agency and will power of the testator, and in effect made the will the mental offspring of another; and it must be shown that the undue influence was operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will was actually executed and published. Bailey v. Bailey, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 556</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 617</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208); Sweat v. Hughes, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 703</cite>, <cite class="app_court">135 S.E.2d 409</cite> (1964);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Undue influence in procuring a will may exist in many forms, and it may be operated through diverse channels; the existence and effective power of undue influence is not always susceptible of direct proof, but may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Stephens v. Brady, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 428</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1952) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Such influence that is obtained by flattery, importunity, superiority of will, mind, or character, which would give dominion over the will to such an extent as to destroy free agency, or constrain one to do against one's will what one is unable to refuse, such is the kind of influence which the law condemns as undue. Sauls v. Estate of Avant, <cite class="ga_app_court">143 Ga. App. 469</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1977) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-208).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There can be no fatally undue influence without
       
       a person incapable of protecting oneself as well as a wrongdoer to be resisted. Morgan v. Ivey, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 850</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E.2d 833</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Evidence of undue influence over the mind and will of the testator at another time will not invalidate a will. Only such influence which exists at the time of the purported will's execution destroys the testator's freedom of volition so as to invalidate a will. Crews v.

       Trial court properly denied the motions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict filed by the executors of a will and trust because there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the documents were invalid as a product of undue influence based on the executors taking complete control of the elderly testator and isolating the testator from the testator's sons, as well as substituting desires and having the testator sign a new will and trust, which benefitted the executors and excluded the testator's wife and sons.

      <p>
       <p>

       Fraud is a distinct head of objection to the validity of a will,
      
      from importunity and undue influence; usually they are the very opposites of each other. Both are equally destructive of the validity of a will. Stephens v. Brady, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 428</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1952) (decided under former Code 1933,

   113-208, 113-209).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Fraud, to invalidate a will, must amount to force or fear
      
      and must, in effect, make the will the mental offspring of some other person, and must be operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will is executed. Butler v. Lashley, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 508</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - There was no fraud when the basis for such claim was the attorney's failure to inform testator as to the powers and fees of an executor, matters which did not affect the testator's plan in making the testator's will. Yancey v. Hall, <cite class="ga_court">265 Ga. 466</cite>, <cite class="app_court">458 S.E.2d 121</cite> (1995) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court properly granted a will beneficiary summary judgment on the issue of fraud because there was no evidence in the record that would create a genuine issue of material fact as to fraud since the alleged two misrepresentations were not shown to have been relied upon by the testator when the will was created. Johnson v. Burrell, <cite class="ga_court">294 Ga. 301</cite>, <cite class="app_court">751 S.E.2d 301</cite> (2013).

       - For one to represent to a wife that her husband is unfaithful to his marital vows, and giving to another the love and affection due his wife, whether the representation of infidelity be true or false, is likely to strongly influence her in the disposition of the property she may leave; hence, the evidence on behalf of the caveators was sufficient on the issue of fraud to have gone to the jury.

       - There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that a testator's will was procured by fraud because the propounder and the propounder's wife encouraged the caveator and the caveator's spouse to go on vacation, and they embarked on a campaign to convince the testator that the caveator had stolen all the testator's money, left the testator broke, and abandoned the testator; those were misrepresentations, but the misrepresentations worked because the testator changed the testator's will to disinherit the caveator completely, and as a result of those misrepresentations, the testator went into the meeting with the attorney who drafted the will intending to leave the testator's entire estate to the propounder, and the testator would have done so were it not for the attorney's suggestion that the testator leave something to the caveator's children, who were the testator's grandchildren.

        <p>
       - Upon the trial of an issue arising upon the propounding of a will and a caveat thereto, the burden, in the first instance, is upon the propounder of the alleged will to make out a prima facie case, by showing the factum of the will and that at the time of the will's execution the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make the will, and, in making the will, acted freely and voluntarily. When this is done, the burden of proof shifts to the caveator. Cornelius v.

       - In a will contest, the caveator was properly prevented from cross-examining the executor as to the effect of the will's in terrorem clause as the uncontroverted testimony showed that the testator was of sound mind and was not influenced by the desires of others, and evidence as to the effect of the forfeiture provision would not have been probative of either undue influence or the lack of testamentary capacity.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Undue influence in procuring a will may exist in many forms, and it may be operated through diverse channels; the existence and effective power of undue influence is not always susceptible of direct proof and undue influence may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Stephens v. Bonner, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 128</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E. 383</cite> (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Very wide range of testimony is permissible on the issue of undue influence,
       
       due to the fact that it seldom can be shown except by circumstantial evidence. It results from the circumstances and surroundings of the testator and the testator's associations with the person or persons exercising the undue influence. Peretzman v. Simon, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 681</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 471</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>

        It is proper to consider the testator's dealings and associations with the beneficiaries,
       
       the testator's habits, motives, feelings, the testator's strength or weakness of character, the testator's confidential, family, social, and business relations, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the will, the testator's mental and physical condition at the time the will was made; the testator's manner and conduct, and generally every fact which will throw light on the issue raised by the charge of undue influence.

       In determining whether undue influence had been exercised by the wife, so as to substitute her will for that of her husband in his last will and testament, all of the circumstances including the conduct and demeanor of the parties with respect to each other, their comparative ages and mental capacity, and especially any physical and mental infirmity due to advanced age of the husband, may be taken into consideration.

        Allegations of undue influence must be accompanied by the particular facts.
       
       Bare conclusions such as "fraud, scheme, device, and undue influence" are insufficient allegations in a caveat to present an issue. English v. Shivers, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 515</cite>, <cite class="app_court">133 S.E.2d 867</cite> (1963) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Where the caveat is stripped of allegations as to matters which do not appear to have had any bearing or influence upon the testator in the making of the testator's will and nothing remains except bare conclusions of the pleader as to fraud, scheme, device, and undue influence, the caveat does not provide sufficient issues to challenge the validity of the will.

       - When a will is attacked upon the grounds of the mental incapacity of the testator, and of undue influence in the procurement of the will, it is always proper to inquire whether the provisions of the will are just and reasonable, and in accord with the state of the testator's family relations, or the contrary. Knox v. Knox, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 677</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 89</cite> (1957) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Rules of evidence take into account the peculiar circumstances surrounding the issue of undue influence and acts, conduct, and circumstances may constitute undue influence when exercised on a person of failing mind, poor health, and other mental and bodily enfeeblements which would not be such undue influence as to void a will executed by a person of sound mind, good health, and intelligence.

       Quantity of influence varies with the circumstances of each case, according to the relations existing between the parties and the strength or weakness of mind of the testator; thus, the amount of influence necessary to dominate a mind impaired by age or disease may be decidedly less than that required to control a strong mind. Bowman v. Bowman, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 796</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 298</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - Person standing in a confidential relation to another is not prohibited from exercising any influence whatever to obtain a benefit to oneself. The influence must be what the law regards as undue influence; such influence that is obtained by flattery, importunity, superiority of will, mind, or character, which would give dominion over the will to such an extent as to destroy free agency or to constrain one to do against one's will what one is unable to refuse. Daniel v. Etheredge, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 191</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 181</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Trial court properly granted a will beneficiary summary judgment on the issue of undue influence because the caveators failed to come forward with any evidence that the beneficiary attempted to influence the making or the contents of the testator's will despite the existence of a confidential relationship.

       - When a person obtaining a substantial benefit under a will occupies a confidential relationship toward the maker of the will and is not a natural object of the maker's bounty, a presumption of undue influence arises if it is shown that the will was made at the request of such person.

        <p>
       - For one to represent to a wife that her husband is unfaithful to his marital vows, and giving to another the love and affection due his wife, whether the representation of infidelity is true or false, is likely to strongly influence her in the disposition of the property she may leave; hence, the evidence on behalf of the caveators was sufficient on the issues of fraud and undue influence to have gone to the jury. Stephens v. Brady, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 428</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1952) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Trial court correctly denied an executor's motion for directed verdict in an action wherein the child of the testator filed a caveat and objection to the probate of the testator's last will and testament on the grounds that the will was the product of undue influence as sufficient evidence existed to support the conclusion that undue influence was used to have the testator bequeath the only asset, namely a home, to the caregiver who was hired by the executor. The record established that the executor blocked calls from the testator's child, refused to let the child see the testator, and a confidential relationship was established between the caregiver and the testator as the caregiver took an active role in the planning, preparation, and execution of the will.

       Evidence regarding the circumstances and surroundings of the testator and the testator's associations authorized the jury's finding that the testator's will was the product of undue influence because the propounder and the propounder's wife encouraged the caveator and the caveator's wife, who had moved in with the testator and the testator's wife and provided the care they needed, to leave the state for a vacation, and in their absence the propounder poisoned the testator's mind against the caveator, telling the testator falsely that the caveator had stolen all the caveator's money, that the testator was broke, and that the caveator had abandoned the testator and would not return; acting under the influence of the propounder and the propounder's wife, the testator secured a restraining order that prevented the caveator from seeing the testator for six months after the caveator returned, and the testator's will radically changed the distribution of the estate envisioned by the testator in a previous will by changing the will to disinherit the caveator completely.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section carries forward former OCGA Secs. 53-2-40 and 53-2-43, adding the concept from Georgia case law that a testator may sign by mark.
   Former OCGA Sec. 53-2-43(b) is clarified, stating that no other individual may sign a witness's name to the will.
   (For general provisions as to the competency of witnesses, see OCGA Sec. 24-9-1 et seq.)
   This section also carries forward the concept from former OCGA Sec. 53-2-5 that a codicil must be executed with the same formality as a will.

       - Substantive origin of the statute of frauds, as well as that of the former section, was the need to establish rules for the execution of wills which precluded as well as possible the occurrence of fraud in the disposition of estates, often the result of a life's labor. Waldrep v. Goodwin, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 1</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E.2d 432</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-301).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Law provides no special formalities about the witnesses to a will;
       
       it is sufficient if the witnesses attest and subscribe the will in the presence of the testator; the law implies the request in the consummation of the act, and no special request by the testator is necessary. Whitfield v. Pitts, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 259</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 549</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-301).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Attestation of a will by the subscribing witnesses, signed by the witnesses in the presence of the testator and with the testator's knowledge may be treated as the equivalent of a request by the testator that these persons subscribe their names as witnesses to the paper, and especially when such testator is shown to have been seeking witnesses for the purpose of having the witnesses attest the testator's will. Glenn v. Mann, <cite class="ga_court">234 Ga. 194</cite>, <cite class="app_court">214 S.E.2d 911</cite> (1975) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Although the designation-of-beneficiary document for purposes of decedent's teachers' retirement system benefits executed by the decedent in 1965 did contain the signature of a notary public, as well as the signature of the decedent's employer, there was no showing that these persons signed the document in the presence of the decedent as attesting witnesses and therefore the document could not operate as a will.

       Wills must be in writing, and executed according to prescribed formalities,
      
      and a failure to dispose of property cannot be supplied by showing sayings and statements of the testator that the testator desired or intended to dispose of the property in a certain way, or that the testator understood that the will disposed of the property in a way different from that expressed in the will. Lining v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 22</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 410</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-301).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      When the only objection which the caveator makes to the appointment of an administrator is that it was the intention of the testator that the property should go to the caveator, and there is nothing in the will to indicate that such was the testator's intent, the court properly sustained the demurrer (now motion to dismiss) to the caveat. Lining v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 22</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 410</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - If the situation and circumstances of the testator and the attesting witnesses to a will at the time of the will's attestation are such that the testator, in the testator's actual position, might have seen the act of attestation, the requirement of the law that the witnesses shall sign in the testator's presence is sufficiently met.

They will no longer be followed because there can be no fraud when all parties sit at the same table and affix their signatures in the presence of each other regardless of who signs first. Waldrep v.

       In a proceeding to probate a will the burden is upon the propounder to prima facie prove the factum of the will, that is, that the will was executed with requisite formalities; that the testator executed the will freely and voluntarily, and was at the time of sound and disposing mind and memory. This burden carried, the onus of proving the will is not valid for one of the reasons alleged in the caveat shifts to the caveator. Bianchini v.

       This section carries forward the first two sentences of OCGA Sec. 53-2-42.
   Former OCGA Sec. 53-2-42 also stated that greater proof will be necessary to show that the testator knew the will's contents if the scrivener or the scrivener's immediate family receive substantial amounts under the will. The reference is repealed as unnecessary in that suspicious circumstances such as those described will result in closer scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding the will execution under the theories of duress and undue influence.
   Likewise, former OCGA Sec. 53-2-46, dealing with the competency required of an interpreter who is used to convey the wishes of the testator to the scrivener or the witnesses, is repealed as unnecessary.

       - Trial court did not err in granting a propounder's motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether a testator's will was properly executed because pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c04s53-4-21" target="_self">53-4-21</a></cite>, the testator's signature on the will gave rise to a presumption that she knew the contents of the will; the mere fact that only portions of the will were read aloud to the testator was of no consequence. Strong v. Holden, <cite class="ga_court">287 Ga. 482</cite>, <cite class="app_court">697 S.E.2d 189</cite> (2010).

       Because a parent's will was plain and unambiguous and did not contain a residue clause, the lapsed gift of the residue passed to the parent's three daughters by intestacy according to O.C.G.A.

   65(b); although the parent expressed disappointment with two daughters and left them specific bequests of $10.00 each, the parent did not express an intent to disinherit the daughters. Banner v.

       Subsection (a) carries over the concept of competency of witnesses from former OCGA Sec. 53-2-45, adding that the witness to a will must be age 14 or over.
   (Case law indicates that an individual who is age 14 or over is presumed competent to witness a will.)
   The competency of witnesses is defined in OCGA Sec. 24-9-1 and Article 1 of Title 9 of the Code. Subsection (b) carries forward the concept of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-44 that the witness must be competent only at the time of attestation, not necessarily at the time of probate.

        Statute requires that a testator have knowledge of the contents of the will
       
       at the time of execution, not that the testator recall the contents at some subsequent time. If the latter were required no validly executed will would be secure against failure of memory or mental aberration which so often result as time goes by. White v. Irwin, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 836</cite>, <cite class="app_court">142 S.E.2d 255</cite> (1965).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When a will was written as directed by the testator, and the evidence shows that the testator wishes were carefully and thoroughly discussed in the process and expressed in the will, the fact that the will was not read back to the testator after the will was written, in the absence of any other evidence that the testator did not know the contents of the will, is ineffective as showing a lack of knowledge on the part of the testator. Whitfield v. Pitts, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 259</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 549</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

        COMMENT

      </h4>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) of this section defines joint wills.
   (See OCGA Sec. 53-5-5, which requires that a will remain on file in the probate court once it is probated.
   In the case of a joint will, a certified copy of the joint will would be used upon the death of the second testator to die.)
   Subsection (b) changes the definition of mutual wills to refer only to the separate wills of two or more testators that contain reciprocal dispositions of property.
   The term "mutual will" under former OCGA Sec. 53-2-51 referred to one joint will or two or more separate wills that either were based on express contract or contained an express statement that they were "mutual wills".

       - Joint will is one where the same instrument is made the will of two or more persons and is jointly signed by them. Such a will contained in a single instrument is the will of each of the makers, and at the death of one, may be probated as that one's will, and be again probated at the death of the other as the will of the latter. Such wills are usually executed to make testamentary disposition of joint property. Wills may be joint or mutual, or both joint and mutual. Lampkin v.

       - Mutual wills may be defined as the separate wills of two persons, which are reciprocal in their provisions. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

   §
   113-104).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Mutual wills are those which contain reciprocal provisions giving the separate property of each testator to the other and such wills are specifically recognized by the law. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-104).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Mutual wills result from a mutual intention on the part of the makers thereof to make reciprocal testamentary gifts one to the other and are not dependent for their validity upon any consideration therefor. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

   §
   113-104).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Wills are mutual, whether jointly or separately executed, when each testator has full knowledge of the testamentary intentions of the other and when each with such knowledge and while acting in concert makes a reciprocal gift of one's separate estate to the other. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Purpose of subsection (b)
       
       was to eliminate the uncertainty that had crept into the law through the practice of courts, on an ad hoc basis, of finding wills to be "mutual" by implication. Coker v.

        <p>
       - Joint will in which the testators provided for a certain distribution in case of simultaneous death, or if the survivor did not make another will, recognized specifically that the survivor might make a new will to replace the joint will; thus, the will was not mutual. McPherson v. McPherson, <cite class="ga_court">254 Ga. 122</cite>, <cite class="app_court">327 S.E.2d 204</cite> (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        Intention of persons to make mutual wills may be inferred
       
       from the facts and circumstances under which such wills were made, and an express agreement between testators to execute mutual wills is not essential to their validity. Lampkin v.

       Agreements to make wills are not established merely because two persons simultaneously make reciprocal testamentary dispositions in favor of each other, when the language of such wills contain nothing to the effect that the instruments are the result of a contract.

       Fact that separate wills, with reciprocal provisions, have been executed by two persons simultaneously, or about the same time, is not of itself evidence of a contract between the testators, but such a contract may appear from the terms of the will, by direct reference or by inference. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Leaptrot, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 783</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 555</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Ample consideration for a husband's promise to devise property to his wife for life, provision to be made for a third person upon the death of the testator, is found in the promise of the wife to make a similar testamentary distribution on her part, when the proof is ample that the wife had property of her own.

       - Trial court did not err when the court concluded that the will of a husband and wife was joint and mutual and that the husband and wife had an enforceable contract not to revoke that will because the husband and wife each agreed to give the other certain described real and personal property as valuable consideration if one or the other survived, and they also agreed that if they died simultaneously, or at the survivor's death, that the residue of the estate would go to their four children, all of whom were biologically the husband's children and two of whom were biologically the wife's children; when the husband died the wife, as the survivor, benefitted from the joint and mutual will when she probated it as the husband's last will and testament and conveyed the husband's entire estate to herself.

       - General rule is that, if two persons execute wills at the same time, either by one or two instruments, making reciprocal dispositions in favor of each other, the mere execution of such wills does not impose such a legal obligation as will prevent revocation.

       - When the mutual wills are the result of a contract based upon a valid consideration, and when, after the death of one of the parties, the survivor has accepted benefits under the will of the other which was executed pursuant to an agreement, equity will interpose to prevent fraud.

       - Joint will is one where the same instrument is made the will of two or more persons and is jointly signed by them. Such a will contained in a single instrument is the will of each of the makers, and at the death of one, may be probated as that one's will, and be again probated at the death of the other as the will of the latter.

       - Mutual wills may be defined as the separate wills of two persons, which are reciprocal in their provisions. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Mutual wills are those which contain reciprocal provisions giving the separate property of each testator to the other and such wills are specifically recognized by the law. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Mutual wills result from a mutual intention on the part of the makers thereof to make reciprocal testamentary gifts one to the other and are not dependent for their validity upon any consideration therefor. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

   §
   113-104).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Wills are mutual, whether jointly or separately executed, when each testator has full knowledge of the testamentary intentions of the other and when each with such knowledge and while acting in concert makes a reciprocal gift of one's separate estate to the other. Lampkin v. Edwards, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 708</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Joint will in which the testators provided for a certain distribution in case of simultaneous death, or if the survivor did not make another will, recognized specifically that the survivor might make a new will to replace the joint will; thus, the will was not mutual.

       Fact that separate wills, with reciprocal provisions, have been executed by two persons simultaneously, or about the same time, is not of itself evidence of a contract between the testators, but such a contract may appear from the terms of the will, by direct reference or by inference.

       Ample consideration for a husband's promise to devise property to his wife for life, provision to be made for a third person upon the death of the testator, is found in the promise of the wife to make a similar testamentary distribution on her part, when the proof is ample that the wife had property of her own.

       - General rule is that, if two persons execute wills at the same time, either by one or two instruments, making reciprocal dispositions in favor of each other, the mere execution of such wills does not impose such a legal obligation as will prevent revocation.

       - When the mutual wills are the result of a contract based upon a valid consideration, and when, after the death of one of the parties, the survivor has accepted benefits under the will of the other which was executed pursuant to an agreement, equity will interpose to prevent fraud. This can be accomplished only through a court of equity, as the probate court has no jurisdiction to enforce such agreement. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v.

       - Trial court erred in denying a widow's motion for summary judgment affirming an order admitting a decedent's 2001 will to probate as the 2001 will was not expressly revoked since there was no evidence of a subsequent will or other written instrument that was executed, subscribed, and attested with the same formality as a will, which contained a statement expressly revoking earlier wills; there was no implied revocation of the 2001 will since an implied revocation by a subsequent inconsistent will would take effect only when a subsequent will became operative, and then was only effective as to inconsistencies between the later testamentary instrument and an earlier testamentary instrument, so the subsequent inconsistent will had to be a written document, and there was no written subsequent inconsistent will.

        <p>
       - When a paper found among a decedent's papers is offered for probate as a will, and appears to have been canceled or obliterated in a material part, a presumption arises that the cancellations or obliterations were made by the deceased, and that the deceased intended the papers to operate as a revocation.

      <p>
       This section carries forward the provisions of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-72.
   This section changes the former law by deleting the phrase in former OCGA Sec. 53-2-72(b) that would allow an express revocation to become effective "independently of the validity or ultimate fate of the will or other instrument containing the revocation."
   (This change is in accord with the provisions of Code Sec. 53-4-45, which explain the result that occurs when an instrument that contains an express revocation is itself later revoked.)
   As is indicated by Code Sec. 53-1-2, the term "will" includes the term "codicil". See Code Sec. 53-4-47 for the effect of an implied revocation.

       - Trial court erred in denying a widow's motion for summary judgment affirming an order admitting a decedent's 2001 will to probate as the 2001 will was not expressly revoked since there was no evidence of a subsequent will or other written instrument that was executed, subscribed, and attested with the same formality as a will, which contained a statement expressly revoking earlier wills; there was no implied revocation of the 2001 will since an implied revocation by a subsequent inconsistent will would take effect only when a subsequent will became operative, and then was only effective as to inconsistencies between the later testamentary instrument and an earlier testamentary instrument, so the subsequent inconsistent will had to be a written document, and there was no written subsequent inconsistent will.

       - While statements made in the handwriting of the deceased on the margin of will opposite items obliterated or canceled, designating a contrary disposition of the property covered by such items, but unattested, as well as a general unattested statement written on the cover of the will declaring that the will was to be ineffective, and indicating a different testamentary scheme, would not operate as an express revocation in writing of the will, such declarations made in the handwriting of the testator would tend to support presumption of law that the material obliterations or cancellations were made by the testator for the purpose of revoking the will. Singleton v. Shewmake, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 785</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 232</cite> (1917) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        Probate of a former will may be defeated upon proof of the execution of a later writing
       
       by the testator, which contained a clause revoking the prior will, and of the loss or destruction of the later instrument, without proof of the rest of the contents of the lost or destroyed instrument. Driver v. Sheffield, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       While revocation of a will cannot be established by proof of parol declarations by the testator, a clause in a later written instrument, properly executed by the testator, expressly revoking a former will is not rendered ineffective merely by the loss or destruction of the instrument which contains it, and proof of the revocation clause in a later lost or destroyed will may be made by parol. Driver v. Sheffield, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When a will has been expressly revoked by a subsequent will executed with the same formality and attested by the same number of witnesses as are requisite for the execution of a will, the revocation or destruction of the latter does not per se revive the former, but the former will can be revived only by republication.

       - Trial court erred in denying a widow's motion for summary judgment affirming an order admitting a decedent's 2001 will to probate as the 2001 will was not expressly revoked since there was no evidence of a subsequent will or other written instrument that was executed, subscribed, and attested with the same formality as a will, which contained a statement expressly revoking earlier wills; there was no implied revocation of the 2001 will since an implied revocation by a subsequent inconsistent will would take effect only when a subsequent will became operative, and then was only effective as to inconsistencies between the later testamentary instrument and an earlier testamentary instrument, so the subsequent inconsistent will had to be a written document, and there was no written subsequent inconsistent will.

       This section carries forward the provisions of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-74, with the exception of the last sentence (dealing with the presumption when an immaterial portion of the will is revoked), which is repealed as unnecessarily repetitious.
   The new Code section also deletes the reference to duplicates of wills.

         Statute requires intent to revoke and actual destruction of will.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - An intention to revoke a will and actual destruction of the will are both necessary to effect a revocation which provides for express revocation by any destruction or obliteration of the will. Payne v. Payne, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 613</cite>, <cite class="app_court">100 S.E.2d 450</cite> (1957) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-404).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Destroying of a will without intention to revoke the will would not revoke the will, neither would the intention to destroy a will without actually doing so revoke the will; there must be both. Payne v. Payne, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 613</cite>, <cite class="app_court">100 S.E.2d 450</cite> (1957) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-404).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Reason that the intention of the testator in making marks or in writing a new instrument is material is that joint operation of act and intention is necessary to revoke a will. Carter v. First United Methodist Church, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 493</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-404).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Question of whether or not canceled provision is "material" is one of law.
       
       Carter v. First United Methodist Church, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 493</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-404).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Drawing of pencil lines through provisions of a will is a sufficient "canceling."
       
       Carter v. First United Methodist Church, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 493</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-404).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        How far the cancellation or obliteration must extend before presumption of revocation will arise is not settled.
       
       Ellis v. O'Neal, <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 751</cite> (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

         "Material" obliteration.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Obliteration of the names of two of the four beneficiaries, whom the testator designated were to take "equally, share and share alike, per stirpes," was material because the obliteration directly affected the distribution of all property in the estate. This finding of a material obliteration gave rise to a rebuttable presumption under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c04s53-4-44" target="_self">53-4-44</a></cite> that the testator intended to revoke the entire will. Lovell v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">272 Ga. 675</cite>, <cite class="app_court">533 S.E.2d 64</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Markings on a will described as smudges or a water stain,
       
       and that did not obscure names thereon, were not sufficient evidence of actual cancellation or obliteration to prove revocation. Wells v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">265 Ga. 181</cite>, <cite class="app_court">453 S.E.2d 690</cite> (1995) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - Because a vehicle may be particularly personal to the vehicle's owner, it may be a repository for a testator's effects; thus, a caveator satisfied the requisite burden for purposes of summary judgment through the presumption of revocatory intent found in O.C.G.A.

       - When an instrument found among a decedent's papers was offered for probate as decedent's will, and appeared to have been canceled or obliterated by marks drawn diagonally across certain material items thereof, the obliteration of which affected the testamentary scheme, a presumption arose that such cancellations or obliterations were made by the deceased, and that the deceased intended the markings to operate as a total revocation of the will. Singleton v. Shewmake, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 785</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 232</cite> (1917) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>

       When a will has been canceled or obliterated in a material part, a presumption of revocation arises, and the burden is on the propounder to show that no revocation was intended. Langan v.

       - Statements made in the handwriting of the deceased on the margin of a will opposite items obliterated or canceled, designating a contrary disposition of the property covered by such items, would tend to support the presumption of law that the material obliterations or cancellations were made by the testator for the purpose of revoking the will. Singleton v. Shewmake, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 785</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 232</cite> (1917) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       When a testator who has executed a will in duplicate cancels or destroys one of the duplicates, the presumption is that the testator meant thereby to revoke the will. King v. Bennett, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">110 S.E.2d 772</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Statute plainly indicates that, when there has been a multiple execution of a will, the destruction of one of the executed copies by the maker of the will with intention to revoke the will has the effect of revoking all of the copies, and the same presumption of intention to revoke arises from the destruction of one of the duplicates as would arise if the destroyed copy were the only one. King v. Bennett, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">110 S.E.2d 772</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the will when found among the papers of the testator was torn in four pieces, with the signature torn from the will, and missing, this certainly shows the will's cancellation in a material portion, the signature of a will being essential to the will's validity. This evidence of the condition of the original will, which was in the custody of the testator until the testator's death, and found among the testator's papers shortly after the testator's death, raised a presumption that the cancellation was done by the testator and that the testator intended to revoke the will. King v. Bennett, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">110 S.E.2d 772</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

       In a will contest the cross-propounders, in seeking to probate a copy of a material portion of a will, the original of which portion they asserted had been destroyed, had the burden of overcoming the presumption that the destruction had been done by the testator personally with the intention to revoke, and the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the burden rested on the cross-propounders to prove that the copy offered by them was in substance and intent the same as the original.

       When there is no direct or circumstantial evidence that alterations in a will were made after the execution of the will, it must be presumed that the alterations were made by the testator, if the will was in the testator's custody until the time of the testator's death.

       - When there was no dispute as to the cancellation of material parts of the will and as to written declarations by the testator declaring the testator's will ineffective and no evidence to indicate that the testator intended to revoke only the canceled items, the statutory presumption as to a revocation of the entire will was not rebutted.

       Presumption of revocation may be rebutted, among other ways, by proof that a will was lost or destroyed prior to the death of the testator without the testator's consent, and that, when evidence to such effect is submitted, the question whether the presumption has been overcome is for determination by the jury, in view of all of the evidence and circumstances in the case, and the credibility attributed by the jury to the witnesses.

       Judge may instruct the jury to the effect that the presumption in favor of revocation may be rebutted by showing that the will was not destroyed by the testator, or that if the testator did destroy the will, the testator did not thereby intend to revoke the will; provided only that such an instruction, like others, must be supported by sufficient evidence.

       - In a suit asserting undue influence and seeking revocation of a testator's will, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on the issue of revocation during the presentation of the plaintiff's case-in-chief because, under the change set forth in O.C.G.A.

       - When alterations appear on the face of a will, and other alterations on portions of the will which have previously been incorporated in a codicil, the alterations are material as regards the codicil, since the alterations concern the very purpose and subject matter of the codicil, but if the alterations and obliterations not incorporated by, and later to, the codicil were not intended as a revocation of the codicil, the burden was on the propounders to show that fact. Langan v. Cheshire, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 107</cite>, <cite class="app_court">65 S.E.2d 415</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

       As a general rule, the burden is on a person attacking a paper offered for probate as a will to sustain the grounds of the propounder's attack.

       - Doctrine of dependent relative revocation (conditional revocation) is a doctrine of presumed intention, and has grown up as a result of an effort which courts always make to arrive at the real intention of the testator.

       - Evidence that old will, with pencil lines drawn through property disposition provisions, was found among testator's personal papers folded together with later writing making a somewhat different disposition of the testator's property was some evidence tending to establish that the cancellation and the making of a new will were parts of one scheme, and the revocation of the old will was so related to the making of the new as to be dependent upon it; this evidence was sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption of revocation and to give rise to a presumption in favor of the propounder under the doctrine of dependent relative revocation or conditional revocation, thus shifting the burden of proof to the caveator to prove, in essence, that decedent would have preferred intestacy. Carter v. First United Methodist Church, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 493</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

      <p>
       This new Code section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-2-73(b). The section is relevant in cases in which a previous will or part of a previous will has been expressly revoked or amended by a will or other written instrument ("revoking instrument") and subsequently that revoking instrument is itself revoked.
   (This Code section is not necessary in the case of an implied revocation because, as stated in Code Sec. 53-4-42, an implied revocation only becomes effective if the revoking instrument is still in place when the testator dies.)
   The revocation of the revoking instrument may occur by way of a subsequent will or other formal writing (as described in Code Sec. 53-4-43) or by an act of revocation (as described in Code Sec. 53-4-44).
   If the revoking instrument had revoked the previous will in its entirety, the presumption is that the previous will remains revoked (that is, the previous will is not revived) when the revoking instrument is itself revoked. This presumption may be overcome if the terms of the will or other writing that revokes the revoking instrument or the circumstances surrounding the act of revocation of the revoking instrument (including statements made by the testator) indicate that the testator intended to revive the previous will.
   If the previous will had been only partially revoked or amended by the revoking instrument, the previous will is presumed to be revived when the revoking instrument is revoked unless the terms of the formal writing that revokes the revoking instrument or the circumstances surrounding the act of revocation of the revoking instrument (including statements made by the testator) indicate that the testator intended that the revoked or amended provisions would not be revived.
   Subsection (e) provides that, even if the previous will or a portion of the previous will is not revived by virtue of the application of the first four subsections, it is still possible to republish the previous will, using the procedure described in Code Sec. 53-4-50.
   This new Code section is meant to supplement rather than replace the doctrine of dependent relative revocation as it has developed in the Georgia case law.

       - While statements made in the handwriting of the deceased on the margin of will opposite items obliterated or canceled, designating a contrary disposition of the property covered by such items, but unattested, as well as a general unattested statement written on the cover of the will declaring that the will was to be ineffective, and indicating a different testamentary scheme, would not operate as an express revocation in writing of the will, such declarations made in the handwriting of the testator would tend to support presumption of law that the material obliterations or cancellations were made by the testator for the purpose of revoking the will. Singleton v. Shewmake, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 785</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 232</cite> (1917) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>

        Probate of a former will may be defeated upon proof of the execution of a later writing
       
       by the testator, which contained a clause revoking the prior will, and of the loss or destruction of the later instrument, without proof of the rest of the contents of the lost or destroyed instrument. Driver v. Sheffield, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While revocation of a will cannot be established by proof of parol declarations by the testator, a clause in a later written instrument, properly executed by the testator, expressly revoking a former will is not rendered ineffective merely by the loss or destruction of the instrument which contains it, and proof of the revocation clause in a later lost or destroyed will may be made by parol. Driver v. Sheffield, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When a will has been expressly revoked by a subsequent will executed with the same formality and attested by the same number of witnesses as are requisite for the execution of a will, the revocation or destruction of the latter does not per se revive the former, but the former will can be revived only by republication.

       When cross-propounders contended that certain items of the will as originally executed by the testator had been deleted, changed, and destroyed, and sought to set up, establish, and probate what the cross-propounders contended to be a true copy of these items of the will as originally executed by the testator, the burden rested upon the cross-propounders of proving that the copy was in substance and intent the same as the original, and it was error for the court to fail to so instruct the jury.

       In a will contest the cross-propounders, in seeking to probate a copy of a material portion of a will, the original of which portion the cross-propounders asserted had been destroyed, had the burden of overcoming the presumption that the destruction had been done by the testator personally with the intention to revoke, and the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the burden rested on the cross-propounders to prove that the copy offered by the cross-propounders was in substance and intent the same as the original. Sheffield v. Sheffield, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 546</cite>, <cite class="app_court">111 S.E.2d 218</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c04s53-4-46" target="_self">53-4-46</a></cite>(b) clearly requires that the presumption of intent to revoke be rebutted in order for a copy of a will to be probated, and Georgia law does not allow a propounder to probate a will without fulfilling the pertinent evidentiary requirements, even when no caveat has been filed.

       Statute is awkwardly expressed,
      
      but, properly construed, the words "in every such case" refer to every case wherein it is sought to have admitted to probate and record a copy of a lost or destroyed will in lieu of an original; and therefore, when it is sought to prove and establish a will not to be found at the death of the testator, the propounder is confronted with the presumption that the will was revoked by the testator, and that presumption must be rebutted by proof.

       <p>
        <p>
       - On the trial of an application for the probate of a copy of an alleged lost will, the declaration of an heir of the decedent, to the effect that an original will had existed and that the heir had destroyed the will, is not, unless the declarant be a party to the proceeding, admissible in evidence in favor of the propounders. Under such circumstances, the declaration is mere hearsay and is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of revocation. Scott v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">113 Ga. 795</cite>, <cite class="app_court">39 S.E. 500</cite>, <cite class="am_st_r">84 Am. St. R. 263</cite> (1901) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the statute is awkwardly expressed, the rule is that a universal presumption of revocation may be rebutted in a number of ways: first, by proof that the will was lost or destroyed subsequently to the death of the testator; or, second, the presumption of revocation may be overcome by showing that the will was destroyed prior to death, provided however it will be also shown, for example, that the testator did not have possession of the instrument after the instrument's execution, or that while the will was still in existence the testator had lost the testator's testamentary capacity to annul the will, and that such mental incapacity continued up to the time of the testator's death. Saliba v. Saliba, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 577</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 511</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-611).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Presumption of revocation may be rebutted, among other ways, by proof that a will was lost or destroyed prior to the death of the testator without the testator's consent, and that, when evidence to such effect is submitted, the question whether the presumption has been overcome is for determination by the jury, in view of all of the evidence and circumstances in the case, and the credibility attributed by the jury to the witnesses.

       <p>
        <p>

        Declarations of the testator are admissible in evidence
       
       either to support or to rebut the presumption of revocation, although made at any time between the making of the will and the death of the testator, and although the declarations are not shown to have accompanied any particular act of revocation or attempted revocation; their admissibility not depending upon res gestae. Saliba v. Saliba, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 791</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 744</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Presumption of revocation may be rebutted by circumstantial evidence
       
       as well as by direct evidence, and the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a will were relevant for the purpose of showing that the testator had made a will that would inure to the benefit of the propounder, infant child of the testator's deceased brother; and also as showing circumstances tending to illustrate the probability or improbability of later revoking such will. Saliba v. Saliba, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 791</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 744</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Rebuttal of the presumption of revocation of a will when only a copy is found could be made by circumstantial as well as by direct evidence, and when the direct evidence traces a will into the custody of the testator and there stops, it seems that the propounder can only assert that whatever may have happened to the will after the will's delivery to the testator, the testator did not revoke the will, and then submit circumstantial evidence, including declarations of the testator, if any, in support of such assertion.

       Superior court erred in instructing the jury in a suit to probate a copy of a will, that, if the jury believes the alleged testator did not intentionally destroy the testator's will, then the form of their verdict would be, "We, the jury, find in favor of the will;" the error being that the case could not be concluded in favor of the propounder by a mere finding that the testator did not intentionally revoke the testator's will, but, over and beyond that, it would be necessary to find that the propounder had clearly proved the alleged copy "to be such."

Williams v. Swint, <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 66</cite>, <cite class="app_court">235 S.E.2d 489</cite> (1977) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-611).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Question of whether the propounders carried the burden of overcoming the presumption that the original will was revoked was for the jury, and in reviewing the jury verdict, the evidence must be accepted which is most favorable to the party in whose favor the verdict was rendered. Hill v. Cochran, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 473</cite>, <cite class="app_court">371 S.E.2d 94</cite> (1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       Trial court did not err by failing to apply the doctrine of dependent relative revocation to revive the decedent's 1988 will because based on the attorney's trial testimony, the trial court properly found that the markings on the original 1988 will that the decedent brought to a June 2004 meeting with the attorney were so extensive that it could not be determined, even by an experienced lawyer, what the decedent intended to remove and what, if anything, was intended to remain.

        COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section carries forward the portions of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-76 that relate to the marriage of the testator and the birth of a child to the testator.
   This section indicates that the provisions apply in the event of the birth of a posthumous child within ten months of the testator's death.
   This section also clarifies that the adoption of a child by the testator has the same effect as the birth of a child.
   If the will contemplates the marriage or birth or adoption, the event will not result in a revocation of the will.
   Under the presumption that a testator probably would intend to treat after-born or after-adopted children the same as children already born or adopted, the section also states that a will that provides for a class of the testator's children is deemed to be made in contemplation of the birth or adoption of additional members of that class absent an indication of an intent to the contrary.
   Consequently, the subsequent birth or adoption of class members will not result in the revocation of the will. For example, if a testator leaves the entire estate "to my sons" and another son is born, it is presumed that the testator wanted the will to stay in effect and merely to include the new son as a member of the class.
   On the other hand, if a daughter is later born to the testator (an individual, in other words, who is not a member of the class), the will would be revoked rather than stay in effect and leave the entire estate only to the testator's sons.
   Solely for the purposes of this Code section, the mere fact that the testator names already living children will not in and of itself defeat the notion that the gift is a gift to a class of the testator's children.
   See Code Sec. 53-4-58 for the result when a testator fails to provide for a child in the will because the testator believes the child to be dead.

       - It is not required that a provision in the will must be of a beneficial interest in the estate of the testator, but it is sufficient if the will refers to the event and provides for the same either by making a beneficial provision or expressing the intention or desire of the testator that such future husband have no beneficial interest in her estate.

       - No agreement purporting to constitute a common-law marriage, nor cohabitation of the man and woman while holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife, nor birth of children to such parties, will constitute or prove a common-law marriage between them, when the man was legally married to another woman throughout the period of such cohabitation and relationship. Consequently, a will written by the purported wife during the cohabitation was revoked by her subsequent valid marriage to the purported husband after his divorce from his first wife. Williams v.

       When the evidence was in conflict as to whether there had been a previous marriage, the trial court was authorized to find that there had not and, therefore, that the ceremonial marriage between the testator and the caveator was valid so as to cause the revocation of the testator's will.

       - Fact that the testator may have lived some time after the birth of the child, and failed to make any change in the testator's will, can make no difference. The will is void immediately upon the birth of the child, and nothing the testator might do or fail to do could give the will life. The will is dead as completely as if the testator had destroyed the will by burning, or any other means known to the law. Saliba v.

       Son shown to have been born subsequently to the execution of a will is not entitled to recover in ejectment against a purchaser for a valid consideration who relied on the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) probating the will in solemn form, and who purchased prior to any proceeding to set aside such judgment.

       When a proceeding is filed to probate a will which unquestionably has been revoked by the subsequent birth of a child, and no provision has been made in contemplation of that event, and the fact appears on the face of the proceedings, consent by a guardian ad litem that the will be probated is clearly beyond the scope of the guardian's authority, and on a proper application for that purpose the judgment of probate should be set aside. Saliba v. Saliba, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 748</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Revocation is made to turn, not upon any provision made for the child, but upon whether the testator, by the testator's will, has made a provision for such an event.

        <p>
       Probate court did not err in finding the testator's will was not made in contemplation of future children and was thus invalidated by the birth of children after the execution of the will because the reference in the will to "my dependents" in the context of directing the personal representative to check on the availability of survivor benefits was insufficient to show that the testator contemplated future-born children as it did not meet the essential basic requirement of showing that the event of future-born children was in the testator's mind at the time the will was executed.

       - Antecedent will, which makes no provision in contemplation of an adoption, is revoked by implication or inference of law by the testator' legal adoption of a minor child. The act of adopting a child, under the provisions of the adoption statute of 1941 (Ga. L. 1941, p. 305) as amended by the Act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1157), is the equivalent in law of the birth of a child. Thornton v.

      <p>
       This section changes former OCGA Sec. 53-2-76 by providing that a divorce or annulment by the testator does not revoke the testator's will completely but rather results in the former spouse being treated as having predeceased the testator.
   In such a case, the provisions of the anti-lapse statute (Code Sec. 53-4-64) will not be applicable to descendants of the former spouse who are not also descendants of the testator.
   For example, if the testator is divorced but dies with an unrevoked will made during the marriage that named the testator's spouse as a beneficiary under the will, the spouse is treated as having predeceased the testator.
   If descendants of the spouse who are not also descendants of the testator survive the testator, these descendants will not take any portion of the testator's estate if their only claim is as beneficiaries who were substituted for the "predeceased" beneficiary by virtue of the application of Code Sec. 53-4-64.
   The provisions of this Code section apply to all provisions for the former spouse in the will, including provisions naming the former spouse as a fiduciary (executor, trustee of a testamentary trust, etc.).
   This section also provides that the remarriage of the testator to the same spouse will cause the pre-divorce will to become effective again if there has been no intervening change in that will.

       - It clearly expresses the intention of the legislature that in every case subsequent marriage or birth of a child will revoke a will, unless the will contains a provision which is made in contemplation of such an event.

        Under the law, the only questions to be decided are:

       - It is not required that a provision in the will must be of a beneficial interest in the estate of the testator, but it is sufficient if the will refers to the event and provides for the same either by making a beneficial provision or expressing the intention or desire of the testator that such future husband have no beneficial interest in her estate. Williams v. Lane, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 306</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 481</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Testator may refer in his will to a woman to whom he is subsequently married, but in the absence of express reference therein to his future marriage, the will does not show that the reference to the woman was made in contemplation of such an event.

       Provision in the will of a testator giving a beneficial interest in her estate to the man whom she subsequently marries, but containing no mention or reference to the event of her future marriage, does not show that the provision was made in contemplation of her marriage.

       - No agreement purporting to constitute a common-law marriage, nor cohabitation of the man and woman while holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife, nor birth of children to such parties, will constitute or prove a common-law marriage between them, when the man was legally married to another woman throughout the period of such cohabitation and relationship. Consequently, a will written by the purported wife during the cohabitation was revoked by her subsequent valid marriage to the purported husband after his divorce from his first wife. Williams v. Lane, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 306</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 481</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Will is not voided by a marriage ceremony when, at that time, the caveator was incapable of contracting marriage and the ceremony was absolutely void. Graves v.

       <p>
        <p>
       When the evidence was in conflict as to whether there had been a previous marriage, the trial court was authorized to find that there had not and, therefore, that the ceremonial marriage between the testator and the caveator was valid so as to cause the revocation of the testator's will. Faulk v. Faulk, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 522</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 818</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Fact that the testator may have lived some time after the birth of the child, and failed to make any change in the testator's will, can make no difference. The will is void immediately upon the birth of the child, and nothing the testator might do or fail to do could give the will life. The will is dead as completely as if the testator had destroyed the will by burning, or any other means known to the law. Saliba v.

       Son shown to have been born subsequently to the execution of a will is not entitled to recover in ejectment against a purchaser for a valid consideration who relied on the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) probating the will in solemn form, and who purchased prior to any proceeding to set aside such judgment.

       When a proceeding is filed to probate a will which unquestionably has been revoked by the subsequent birth of a child, and no provision has been made in contemplation of that event, and the fact appears on the face of the proceedings, consent by a guardian ad litem that the will be probated is clearly beyond the scope of the guardian's authority, and on a proper application for that purpose the judgment of probate should be set aside. Saliba v. Saliba, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 748</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-408).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Revocation is made to turn, not upon any provision made for the child, but upon whether the testator, by the testator's will, has made a provision for such an event. If, by the testator's will the testator had done so, the will is not revoked; if the testator has not, it is revoked. McParland v. McParland, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 458</cite>, <cite class="app_court">211 S.E.2d 748</cite> (1975) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Antecedent will, which makes no provision in contemplation of an adoption, is revoked by implication or inference of law by the testator' legal adoption of a minor child. The act of adopting a child, under the provisions of the adoption statute of 1941 (Ga. L. 1941, p. 305) as amended by the Act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1157), is the equivalent in law of the birth of a child. Thornton v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 714</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 186</cite> (1951), for comment, see 3 Mercer L. Rev. 233 (1951); 14 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>

        Provision in a will giving an unborn child a beneficial interest in the estate
       
       obviously is made in contemplation of the future birth of a child. Williams v. Lane, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 306</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 481</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       This section revises former OCGA Sec. 53-2-77 by limiting the methods of republishing a will to a republication by a writing that satisfies the formalities for executing a will.
   This Code section also supplements Code Sec. 53-4-45 by providing an alternative means of reinstating a will that was expressly revoked by a written instrument that itself was later revoked.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Rules applicable in the construction of a will are those established by the laws of Georgia and the decisions of the court, viz.: (a) every will is sui generis; (b) the first object is to find the intent of the testator; (c) such intent is to be derived from a consideration of the will as a whole and read in the light of the circumstances surrounding the will's execution; and (d) it is to be presumed that the testator intended to dispose of the testator's entire estate and not to die intestate as to any part of the testator's estate. Cumming v. Cumming, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 655</cite>, <cite class="app_court">135 S.E.2d 402</cite> (1964) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-806).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Every will is a thing to itself.
       
       It is emphatically not only sui juris but sui generis. Its terms are its own law, and the application of that law by construction of itself - of the statute which the testator personally enacted, to the contestants for its bounty, is the plain duty of the court. Stringfellow v. Harman, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 62</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 139</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-806).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        All wills differ; each is a law unto itself,
       
       and must be construed according to the will's own terms. Bratton v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 49</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 204</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Precedents, or adjudged cases, are of but little authority, and of dangerous application, in deciding upon the intention of a testator; the construction depends so much on each case, upon the character of the testator, the terms the testator employs, and all the surrounding circumstances. Sproull v. Graves, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 66</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E.2d 613</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Cardinal rule in construing any will
      
      is the ascertainment of the intention of the testator. Hungerford v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 630</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
      Unambiguous language of the will setting forth the intention of the testator is the sole and controlling guide for determination of intention. Hungerford v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 630</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Search for the intention of testator should be made by two methods:
      
      (1) by looking to the will as a whole, and (2) by scrutinizing every phrase that the will contains. Arnold v. Richardson, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 181</cite>, <cite class="app_court">160 S.E.2d 809</cite> (1968) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - In the construction of wills, the intention of the testator should be the first and great object of inquiry. And this is to be sought for by looking to the whole will, and not to detached parts of the will. Sproull v. Graves, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 66</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E.2d 613</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        In finding testator's intent,
       
       the court is not limited to construing only the residuary clause in question, but may look to "the four corners" of the will to discover the testator's total testamentary disposition. Kirby v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 112</cite> (1975) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-806).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Intention of the testator is not generally to be derived
       
       from mere consideration of fragmentary excerpts from the will, but from examination and consideration of every word which the testator included within the "four corners." Baker v. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 161</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 21</cite> (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3900).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Intentions of a testator are to be derived from a consideration of the testator's will as a whole, read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and are not to be determined by arbitrary conjecture as to what the testator meant nor by consideration of detached portions of the will. Aiken v. Aiken, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 819</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 481</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - It is axiomatic in the construction of wills that the intent of the testator as gathered from the entire instrument is to control. If two clauses of a will are so inconsistent that both cannot stand, the latter will prevail; but the whole will is to be taken together, and operation is to be given every part of it, if this can be done without violating its terms or the intention of the testator. And the intention of the testator is to be sought by looking to the whole will rather than to detached parts of the will. Watts v. Finley, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 629</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 723</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Intention of the testator is to absolutely control. Not only may the rules of grammar be entirely disregarded in order to carry into effect the manifest intention of the testator, but even well-defined technical terms of the law will be given an unusual meaning, or will be held to be meaningless, when it is clear from the provisions in the will that the testator did not use them in their technical sense, or when, to carry out the testator's intention, it is necessary to entirely disregard such technical terms. Buchanan v. Nicholson, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 754</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 743</cite> (1941) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       In construing a will the court is required to examine the will as a whole and to search diligently for the intention of the testator as the same may be revealed therein. This search for the intention of the testator should be made by two methods: (1) by looking to the will as a whole; and (2) by scrutinizing every phrase that the will contains. Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 17</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 585</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In searching for the testator's intent, the court must look diligently to the entire will and circumstances surrounding the testator at the time of the will's execution. Wolfe v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 412</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E.2d 735</cite> (1965) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Cardinal principle in the interpretation of a will is to give effect to the testator's intention, when it can be ascertained from the will, and when such intention is not incompatible with established rules of law and equity. Bratton v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 49</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 204</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Intention of the testator is imperative on the courts, unless it is in conflict with some established rule of law. If it is, the law is more imperious than the intention, and the latter will yield to the former. The law, though, in order to defeat the intention, must be clearly and decidedly in conflict with it. Lane v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 828</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 800</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Every court must determine for itself what the intention of the testator is in the particular case before the court, and that intention should be carried into effect, provided the intention be not unlawful. Whitney v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 674</cite>, <cite class="app_court">107 S.E.2d 191</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Courts are without authority to rewrite by construction an unambiguous will;
       
       for to do that would be to substitute the will of the court for that of the testator. Hungerford v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 630</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       In order to construe item 14 of the will as the petitioners contend it should be, it would be necessary to make deletions and substitutions in the language of the testator, and this court is not authorized to do this, since the item as written has a logical meaning, consistent with the rules of law, which can be given effect. When the language of a will is clear and can be given legal effect as the will stands, the courts will not, by construction, give the will a different effect. Veal v.

        Terms of an unambiguous will may not be changed by extrinsic evidence;
       
       if a clause in a will as the will stands may have effect, it shall be so construed, however well satisfied the court may be of a different testamentary intention. Butler v.

        An estate clearly fixed and devised in one item will not be diminished or enlarged by a subsequent item,

       When, the devise apparently passes a fee-simple estate and does so merely because of the absence of an expressed intent as to what character of estate was actually intended to be devised, and in a subsequent provision the property is devised to others at the death of the first devisee, such provisions should be held to grant a life-estate with remainder over, else such subsequent provision must be held to have no meaning.

       - Given a widow's commission of undue influence in procuring a conveyance of beach property to herself and her son, it was not the decedent's intent in including an in terrorem clause to wholly immunize her from the entire amount of attorney's fees incurred by the estate in the undue influence litigation.

        Will is to be construed by the law as the will existed at the death of the testator,
       
       and the testator's intention will yield to the law only when it clearly and decidedly conflicts therewith. Bailes v. Halsey, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 182</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 472</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

       While the intention of a testator cannot be given effect if contrary to express enactments of the legislature or positive rules of property, in the construction of a will the cardinal rule is that the intention of the testator should be the first and great object of inquiry, and this is to be sought for by looking to the whole will, and not to detached parts of the will, and when so ascertained, shall be given effect as far as may be consistent with the rules of law.

       When a testator used the phrase "children of his body" evidencing an intent to include only natural children of her grandsons, and used the term "children, or descendants thereof" in describing the remaindermen in the testator's codicil, the testator's will was properly construed as excluding the adopted great-grandchildren.

       - Motion for summary judgment of the testator's grandchildren in an action against their three uncles alleging that the grandchildren had an interest in the property that comprised the testator's estate was properly denied because the plain language of the will indicated that the testator did not intend that the bequests follow the law of intestacy, and the presumption in favor of a per stirpes distribution in the anti-lapse statute was overcome; the use of the phrase "per capita" in the will imposed a requirement that the individuals named, the testator's children, take the bequests in the children's own stead, and that the children had to survive the testator; and the grandchildren's mother, the testator's daughter, did not survive the testator.

        In order to prevent the phrase "or their bodily heirs" from becoming meaningless,
       
       it is logical to assume that the testator intended that, after the testator's residuary estate had vested in the testator's children who were in life at the testator's death, if any of these children should die before a complete determination and distribution of the residuary estate, their heirs would stand in the place of the deceased children. Veal v. King, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 298</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 223</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Testamentary provision to the effect that "whatever amount may be over when the donations are all made is to be equally divided among my sisters and brothers" constitutes a gift to a class consisting of testator's sisters and brothers living at the time of testator's death, to the exclusion of descendants of a sister and brother predeceasing testator.

        Word "or" is frequently used to connect two others expressing the same idea.

Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 630</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Rule is that the state assumes that one would rather have his or her property pass within the bloodline,
      
      unless a contrary intent is made clear. Trust Co. Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 222</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 141</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

      In the construction of unclear wills the courts look to that interpretation which carries out the provisions of the statute of distribution, and in the absence of anything in the will to the contrary the presumption is that the testator intended that his or her property should go where the law carries it, namely the channel of natural descent. Trust Co. Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 222</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 141</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

      Statute of distribution seeks to effectuate the presumed intent of an intestate, and when a will is unclear the courts follow the statute of distribution to effectuate the intent of the testator.

       - In the absence of anything in the will to the contrary, the presumption is that an ancestor intends that the ancestor's property should go where the law carries the property, which is supposed to be the channel of natural descent; and that the use of such terms as "in equal shares," or "share and share alike," or "equally divided," would not alone be sufficient to overcome this presumption and require a distribution per capita when the statute would require a distribution per stirpes. Harrison v. Odom, <cite class="ga_court">241 Ga. 284</cite>, <cite class="app_court">244 S.E.2d 874</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Grandchildren take nothing in a will under a bequest to children as a class,
       
       unless there be something to indicate and effectuate an intention that the grandchildren should take the interest of their parent who dies before the testator. Veal v. King, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 298</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 223</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When the right of the testator to receive the moneys in question constituted personal property, and was included within the description "all my personal property," the mere fact that the testator was ignorant of the existence of such right is insufficient to show that the testator did not intend that all of the testator's personal property, whether known or unknown, should go to the testator's wife and daughter as stated in the testator's will.

   Former OCGA Secs. 53-2-92 (dealing with the construction of inconsistent provisions) and 53-2-93 (dealing with the construction of an unconditional gift of income) are repealed.
   The repeal of these rules of construction as statutory mandates does not prohibit a court's use of them as common law guidelines in the construction of wills.

       - The most important of those surrounding circumstances mentioned in the statute are the recipients of one's bounty, their relations to that one and associations with that one, one's uniform affection for them, or any interruption of the current of that affection.

       General rule is that parol testimony is inadmissible to explain a will, except by proving the circumstances which surround the testator; the testator's relation to persons and things about the testator; and this may at all times be done.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Parol testimony was not admissible to raise a latent ambiguity in a devise, and thus to defeat the legal effect of the plain, unambiguous terms used. Gillespie v. Schuman, <cite class="ga_court">62 Ga. 252</cite> (1879) (decided under former Code 1873,
   §
   2457).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the terms of a will are plain and unambiguous, parol testimony as to the sayings or statements of the testator that the testator intended to dispose of the testator's property in a certain way, and to certain persons, different from that expressed in the will, will be rejected. Hanvy v. Moore, <cite class="ga_court">140 Ga. 691</cite>, <cite class="app_court">79 S.E. 772</cite> (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       <p>
        <p>
       While it is true that the cardinal rule for the construction of wills requires that the intention of the testator should be ascertained and enforced, and that in so doing parol evidence may be resorted to when the language of the will is doubtful or uncertain, there is no room for construction when the meaning of the words used in the will is so plain and obvious that it cannot be misunderstood and this is true although the words may express a meaning entirely at variance with the real intention of the testator. Hall v. Beecher, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 354</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 581</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In a declaratory judgment action, the trial court erred in finding that language of a will unambiguous because the will used the alternative and seemingly interchangeable words "live," "reside," and "remain" to describe the conditions of the widow's life estate, and those words were capable of multiple, reasonable interpretations, parol evidence was therefore necessary to resolve the ambiguity and ascertain the decedent's intent in devising the life estate. DeMott v. DeMott, <cite class="ga_app_court">353 Ga. App. 190</cite>, <cite class="app_court">836 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2019).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While courts are authorized to hear parol testimony of the circumstances relating to the testator at the time of the execution of the will, yet when the language of the will is unambiguous and the testator's intention is stated in unmistakable language, parol evidence is inadmissible for the purpose of showing a different intention. Hungerford v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 630</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-807).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If the terms of a will when legally construed are plain and unambiguous, parol evidence cannot be received for the purpose of showing an intention contrary to that which the language when properly construed necessitated, nor is parol evidence admissible to raise a latent ambiguity and then to explain the ambiguity, thus when no such ambiguity exists as a legal construction will not resolve, the construction is for the court, and not for the jury. Snellings v. Downer, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 340</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 531</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

   §
   113-807).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While parol evidence in some instances is authorized to explain an ambiguity in a will, oral testimony would be inadmissible for the purpose of inserting an entirely new clause in a will to dispose of an interest in property which the testator failed to devise. Lining v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 22</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 410</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the language of the will is unambiguous and the testator's intent is stated in clear and precise language, parol evidence is not admissible for the purpose of showing a different intent. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Kelly, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 294</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 584</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the terms of a will are plain and unambiguous, the terms must control, and parol evidence cannot be received to give the will a meaning different from that which is clearly and unequivocally expressed therein. Hall v. Beecher, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 354</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 581</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Admissibility of parol evidence generally.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - If from the will the intention is manifest, there is neither a necessity for, nor a power to admit parol testimony. Ambiguity is the basis upon which it is admitted if at all; if there is no ambiguity, if the intention is manifest, the precedent condition of admissibility is wanting; and it is not an ambiguity which is undefined, a loose supposition that there may be doubt, a conjectural hypothesis of a variant intent. Leroy M. Wiley, Parish &amp; Co. v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">3 Ga. 551</cite> (1847), overruled on other grounds, Folsom v. First Nat'l Bank of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 320</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 461</cite> (1980) (decided under former law).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If the intention cannot be clearly ascertained, by reason of any patent ambiguity as to the thing bequeathed, or the person who shall take, the court will hear evidence to explain such ambiguity as to the thing or person. Williams v. McIntyre, <cite class="ga_court">8 Ga. 34</cite> (1850) (decided under former law).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Parol evidence could not change, add to, or contradict a written will, but where there were ambiguities, whether latent or patent, the ambiguities could be explained by the parol evidence. Burge v. Hamilton, <cite class="ga_court">72 Ga. 568</cite> (1884) (decided under former Code 1882,
   §
   2457) Doyal v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">28 Ga. 262</cite> (1859) See also (decided under former law).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While parol evidence is admissible to raise a latent ambiguity in a description and then explain it, in every case the intention of the maker of the instrument must be gathered from the instrument itself, read in the light of the parol evidence. Of course it is not permissible to create a devise or bequest by parol; but the parol evidence must show what the testator's real intention was from the language used. Olive v. Henderson, <cite class="ga_court">121 Ga. 836</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E. 743</cite>, <cite class="am_st_r">104 Am. St. R. 185</cite> (1905) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

       <p>
        <p>
       - If a double meaning is apparent on the face of the instrument, then the ambiguity is a patent one. If the language is apparently not of double meaning, but is shown to be so only by the aid of collateral or extrinsic facts, the ambiguity is latent. Olive v. Henderson, <cite class="ga_court">121 Ga. 836</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E. 743</cite>, <cite class="am_st_r">104 Am. St. R. 185</cite> (1905) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

        When the language of a will is doubtful or ambiguous,
       
       parol evidence is admissible for the purpose of assisting the court in ascertaining its meaning. In such a case parol evidence may be admitted for the purpose of showing and explaining a latent ambiguity in a will. But, when the terms of a will are plain and unambiguous, they cannot be varied or explained by parol evidence showing an intention on the part of the testator at variance with that expressed in the instrument. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Clark, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 625</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E. 297</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - Writing purporting to convey land "to the heirs of" a named person, when that person is dead and the heirs are ascertainable, is not void upon the ground that "it does not show and does not describe the grantees"; for if there are persons ascertainable who are the heirs of the person named parol evidence would be admissible to establish their identity. Farrar Lumber Co. v. Brindle, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 37</cite>, <cite class="app_court">151 S.E. 923</cite> (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        Motive in making a bequest is a legitimate field for judicial inquiry
       
       only to the extent that motive may illuminate the vital question of intent, when, due to the uncertain and ambiguous language of the will, the testator's intent is doubtful. Hungerford v.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If at the time of execution of the will the testator fails to provide in the will for a living child of the testator solely because the testator believes the child to be dead, the child is entitled to receive a share in the estate as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t53c04s53-4-58ol11">
       If the testator had no other child living at the time the will was executed, an omitted child receives a share equal in value to that which the child would have received had the testator died intestate but only to the extent that any provision in the will to or for the benefit of the surviving parent of the omitted child is not thereby reduced; or
      </li>
      <li id="t53c04s53-4-58ol12">
       If the will contains testamentary gifts to one or more other children of the testator, an omitted child is entitled to receive the share of the estate that the child would have received had the testator included all omitted children with the children to whom testamentary gifts were made under the will and had given an equal share to each child. To the extent feasible, the interest granted an omitted child must be of the same character, whether legal or equitable, present or future, as that left to the testator's other children under the will. In satisfying the share for the omitted child, the shares of the other children shall abate ratably, preserving to the maximum extent possible the testamentary plan adopted by the testator.

       - There is a difference between a "mistake" arising from mere ignorance and one which results from an error of judgment after investigation or from negligent or willful failure to make a proper investigation by means of which the truth could be readily and surely ascertained. It is to such a mistake as that first indicated that the statute applied; it could not have been intended to operate in instances of the latter character. Thornton v. Hulme, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 480</cite>, <cite class="app_court">128 S.E.2d 744</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Will can be set aside for mistake of fact arising from ignorance,

       - Mere fact that a testator bequeathed to the testator's daughter a note in the testator's possession, executed by her to the testator, which had been paid, did not show such a mistake of fact as to the conduct of an heir at law as is contemplated by law, so as to justify a finding that the testator should be deemed to have died intestate as to such heir at law. Watkins v. Jones, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 831</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 889</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

   113-210).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When caveator insists that the trial court erred in directing a verdict for propounder because the evidence shows that the will was executed under a mistake of fact as to the conduct of caveator, the heir at law of testator, viz: that caveator was continuing to assert a right to one-half of the property whereas caveator was not continuing to assert such a right, caveator's evidence shows no more than an erroneous deduction or conclusion by testator that because caveator once asserted a right to one-half of the property, caveator was continuing to do so. This is not ignorance of the basic facts. It is at most an error of judgment resulting from a failure to make an investigation of the matter, which does not constitute a mistake of fact. Thornton v. Hulme, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 480</cite>, <cite class="app_court">128 S.E.2d 744</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Caveat to a will filed by the testator's wife on the ground that the testator mistakenly believed the wife had signed an enforceable antenuptial agreement did not allege a mistake of fact, but a mistake of judgment; the testator knew as a fact that she signed the agreement; whether the testator believed it was enforceable was a matter of judgment. Kaplan v. Kaplan, <cite class="ga_court">266 Ga. 612</cite>, <cite class="app_court">469 S.E.2d 198</cite> (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       Purported mistake of the testator relating to her belief that she owned certain property which was claimed to be owned by son was not a mistake of fact as to the existence or conduct of an heir.

       - When court submitted to the jury the issue of whether the will was executed by the testator under a mistake of fact as to the conduct of the caveatrices, and properly instructed the jury that if the jury found the will to have been so executed it would be inoperative as to such heir or heirs, it was error to instruct the jury that, if the jury found the will to have been so executed, the jury should return a verdict finding against the will as a whole. Moreland v. Word, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 463</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 82</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Law does not require that a father provide for the support of his children after his death;
       
       public policy, of course, favors the support of minor children by the father's estate after death. Russell v.

       - Law does not say, because a man is narrowminded, prejudiced, unforgiving, or even mean in his relations to some of his children, that he is incompetent to make a will, and the testimony of witnesses that he is incapable or incompetent because of such an attitude toward a child cannot make an issue for the jury to pass upon.

        Despite testator's erroneous belief that the testator's son had stolen money,
       
       caveator could still not recover, as the only mistake affecting a will is the testator's erroneous belief that a child is dead. Harper v. Harper, <cite class="ga_court">274 Ga. 542</cite>, <cite class="app_court">554 S.E.2d 454</cite> (2001).

     <p>
      Testamentary gifts may be specific, demonstrative, general, or residuary. A specific testamentary gift directs the delivery of property particularly designated. A demonstrative testamentary gift designates the fund or property from which the gift is to be satisfied but nevertheless is an unconditional gift of the amount or value specified. A general testamentary gift does not direct the delivery of any particular property. A residuary testamentary gift includes all the property of the estate that is not effectively disposed of by other provisions of the will.

       - Will provision which provides that the plaintiff in a case against the executors of the estate, "shall be paid a salary" so long as the plaintiff shall serve as manager of a named business does not purport to make a gift to the plaintiff, and plaintiff's contention that he has a "legacy" under this provision of the will is without merit.

        <p>
       - Demonstrative legacy is one which designates the fund or property from which it is to be satisfied, but is nevertheless an unconditional gift to the legatee of the amount or value specified. That it names a particular fund or other property from which it is to be satisfied is considered to be demonstrative of a convenient mode of payment; if that mode fails, the legacy is to be satisfied out of the general assets of the estate. A demonstrative legacy differs from a general legacy in that it does not, in the first instance, abate upon insufficiency of assets to pay the debts of the estate and the expenses of distribution; it differs from a specific legacy in that there is recourse for its payment from the general assets of the estate in the event of ademption in part or in whole. Owens v. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 289</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 196</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - When a general money legacy is given, the testator is not to be presumed to have intended to make it dependent upon the existence of a fund merely because the testator has indicated that it is to be paid out of that fund. On the contrary, if the will gives a money legacy, and a particular fund is charged with the payment of it, the presumption is that this only indicates an intention to furnish an additional security for its payment; since, if the fund charged is sufficient, the legacy shall not abate, though the condition of the estate is such that other general legacies are compelled to abate. Tennille v. Phelps, <cite class="ga_court">49 Ga. 532</cite> (1873) (decided under former Code 1868,

       Courts are not inclined to construe a legacy to be specific under the statute when the question is in doubt. Morton v. Murrell, <cite class="ga_court">68 Ga. 141</cite> (1881) (decided under former Code 1873,

        <p>
       - General legacy is one which does not direct delivery of any particular property; it is not limited to any particular asset and may be satisfied out of any property of the same general character belonging to the estate of the testator. DuBose v. Box, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 101</cite> (1980).

        General legacy is a gift of something to be furnished out of the testator's general personal estate;
       
       it need not form part of the testator's property at the time of the testator's death. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Bequest in the following words, "also notes to the amount of sixteen hundred dollars on K. and C. security, for the purpose of purchasing a plantation for the use of S. etc.," is not a specific legacy, and is not adeemed by the sale and transfer of the notes by the testator in the testator's lifetime.

         Gift of money is general legacy.

       </h5>

        <p>
       - Legacy of the "particular fund" which testator was to receive for the testator's "home place" was not a gift of money to be paid from a specified sum, but it was a gift of a "particular fund," not of part of it, or of a sum to be taken from it, or out of it, but a gift of the whole of "said sum," a particular fund, raised by the sale of a specific legacy. Whitlock v. Vaun, <cite class="ga_court">38 Ga. 562</cite> (1868) (decided under former Code 1863,
   §
   2426).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Money legacy left to the executor of a will, though expressed to be "in addition to the usual commissions obtained by law, and as a full compensation for any extra trouble he may have in executing the will," is a general legacy, and cannot, as a legacy, be exempted from abatement with other general legacies, in case of a deficiency of assets. Greene v. Foster, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 91</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-808).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       As a general rule, it is true that a gift of money, to be paid from a specified fund is, nevertheless, a general legacy, and a failure of the fund does not destroy the legacy, but it is unquestionably true that a testator may so charge a money legacy upon a particular fund as to make the legacy follow the fate of the fund. Tinsley v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 471</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 297</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-808).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a general money legacy is given, the testator is not to be presumed to have intended to make it dependent upon the existence of a fund merely because the testator has indicated that it is to be paid out of that fund. Thomas v. King, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 463</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 820</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-808).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If the will gives a money legacy, and a particular fund is charged with the payment of it, the presumption is that this only indicates an intention to furnish an additional security for its payment; since, if the fund charged is sufficient, the legacy shall not abate, though the condition of the estate is such that other general legacies are compelled to abate. Thomas v. King, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 463</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 820</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Specific legacy is one which operates on property particularly designated; a gift of money to be paid from a specified fund is nevertheless a general legacy. Tinsley v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 471</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 297</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Special legacy is one which operates on property specifically designated while a specific legatee, is one to whom is bequeathed a particular thing, as distinguished from all others of the same kind. Regents of Univ. Sys. v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 345</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When a will purported to bequeath to the trustees of the University of Georgia the "entire corpus" including accumulated interest, less monthly allowances from the income to four named persons during their lives respectively, and except $100.00 each to two of her husband's nephews, this was a specific legacy to the trustees of the University of Georgia. Regents of Univ. Sys. v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 345</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       Specific bequest or devise has given as its particular characteristic that it gives or devises to the named legatee a particular article or item of property owned by the testator or in some instances to be acquired by him, which is identified and distinguished from all others of the same nature and which, as stated, may be segregated from the mass of the testator's other property or estate. Henderson v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 636</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Special legacy is one that can be separated from the body of the estate and pointed out so as to individualize it, and enable it to be delivered to the legatee as a thing sui juris. The testator fixes upon it, as it were, a label, by which it may be identified and marked for delivery to the owner, and the title to it, as a separable thing, vests at once, on the death of the testator, in the legatee. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       Failure by the testator to particularize the $1,000.00 bonds bequeathed to stated children, forbid their being classified as specific legacies, and, consequently they do not fail but are payable as general legacies, $1,000.00 to each legatee, out of the general assets of the estate, including the proceeds from the sale of the three bonds on hand after the payment of debts, if any, and the expenses of administration. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       Fact that the will provides for the legal title to particular property to be held by a trustee for the benefit of the widow does not prevent the legacy from being a specific one. It is the particular designation of the property itself, not who holds the property's legal title, which makes the legacy specific. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E.2d 261</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Specific legacy means a devise which distinguishes the devised property from all other property of the same nature and thereby enables it to be separated from the body of the estate and delivered to the devisee as a thing sui juris. Peacock v. Owens, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 458</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Specific legacy gives to the named legatee a particular article or item of property owned by the testator, which is identified and distinguished from all others of the same nature, and which may be segregated from the mass of the testator's other property or estate. DuBose v. Box, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 101</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Specific devise of lands carries with it to the devisee
       
       the income, profit, or increase of the specific legacy from the date of the testator's death. Cheshire v. Keaton, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 29</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 579</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

        There is no inhibition against giving a special legacy to several people,
       
       or in making a special legacy to all of the children of the testator. The only question is whether the legacy operates on specific property. Greene v. Foster, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 91</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Legacy is not a specific legacy, which will be adeemed when it does not bequeath a bond so labeled and sequestered as to be distinguished from another bond of a similar kind it is a demonstrative legacy and does not fail if the subject matter be not in existence on the death of the testator. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If the particular property described in the specific legacy is disposed of by the testator during the testator's life or cannot be located at the testator's death, it is adeemed and the legatee has no claim on the estate for the value of the legacy. DuBose v. Box, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 101</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Courts are inclined to construe a legacy to be general and not specific
      
      to the end that an ademption may not result. Bailes v. Halsey, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 182</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 472</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

      <p>
       <p>
      In cases of real doubt as to the nature of the bequest, whether general or special, if the intention of the testator in respect thereto cannot be clearly ascertained from the will, the law will declare it general and not special. Henderson v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 636</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In determining whether a particular bequest is general or special, resort must be had not alone to the particular item creating it, but to the will as a whole, in order to ascertain the intention of the testator which if it may be there discovered must control. Henderson v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 636</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the testator makes a gift of the income on the legacy, and neither the legacy nor the income therefrom is delivered to the beneficiary within the time limits specified in the will, in order to be made whole, the beneficiary is entitled to interest on the income during the period the beneficiary should have been, but was not, receiving such income.

       This section carries over former OCGA Sec. 53-2-97 with modifications in the language, including the addition of language relating to demonstrative testamentary gifts.
   The legal rate of interest in the state of Georgia is set out in Code Sec. 7-4-2.
   Former OCGA Sec. 53-2-98 (defining "executory devise") is repealed as the concepts in this section are covered in recent amendments to OCGA Title 44.

        As a general rule, specific legacies of a productive nature bear interest from the death of the testator.
       
       Beal v. Crafton, <cite class="ga_court">5 Ga. 301</cite> (1848) (decided under former law).

        Legacy of $4,000.00 to be paid in bonds
       
       is not a legacy that bears interest from the testator's death. Downing v. Bain, <cite class="ga_court">24 Ga. 372</cite> (1858) (decided under former law).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When the testator fixes by the testator's will the date
       
       on which a general legacy is to be paid, it bears interest from that date. DuBose v. Box, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 101</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       When the testator is a parent of an infant legatee, or is in loco parentis, the legacy bears interest from the death of the testator, whether the time of payment is postponed or not, unless there is another provision in the will for maintenance of the child. DuBose v. Box, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 101</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When a valid charitable bequest is incapable for some reason of execution in the exact manner provided by the testator, a court of equity will carry it into effect in such a way as will as nearly as possible effectuate the intention of the testator. This doctrine has no application whatever to a case where a charitable bequest fails entirely for the reason that is in opposition to a well-settled rule of law. Kelley v. Welborn, <cite class="ga_court">110 Ga. 540</cite>, <cite class="app_court">35 S.E. 636</cite> (1900), overruled on other grounds, Hood v.

       - Fundamental purpose of cy pres provisions is to allow the court to carry out the general charitable intent of the testator where this intent might otherwise be thwarted by the impossibility of the particular plan or scheme provided by the testator. Evans v. Abney, <cite class="us_code">396 U.S. 435</cite>, <cite class="s_court">90 S. Ct. 628</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">24 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 634 (1970) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Rules governing the establishment and administration of charitable trusts
       
       are different from those applicable to private trusts in giving effect to the intention of the donor and in establishing the charity. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>

        When a charitable intent can be discovered from a will,
       
       a court of equity will carry such intent into execution, and support the charitable purpose, and will not suffer an equitable interest to fail for want of a trustee to support the trust. Moss v. Youngblood, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 689</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

   113-815).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In the construction of charitable bequests, the court will be liberal
       
       so as to carry into effect the intention of the testator. Moss v. Youngblood, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 689</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Bequests for charitable purposes are looked upon with great favor by the courts of this state,
       
       and every means will be resorted to which can legally be used to carry out a charitable intent manifested by a testator in the testator's will. Moss v. Youngblood, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 689</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-815).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Courts look with favor upon trusts for public charitable purposes,
       
       and take special care to enforce them, to guard them from assault, and protect them from abuse. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

   §
   113-815).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Gifts and bequests for religious purposes are more highly favored by laws than other species of trusts. Courts of equity are placed under peculiar obligations to see, even in cases of bequests or devises, that the use is sustained and carried into effect. Trustees of First Methodist Episcopal Church v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">76 Ga. 181</cite> (1886) (decided under former Code 1882,
   §
   2468).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If a gift is made for a public charitable purpose, it is immaterial that the trustee is uncertain or incapable of taking, or that the objects of the charity are uncertain and indefinite; it will, nevertheless, be sustained. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Devises to charity are expressly authorized by the law,

       - As a general rule, the doctrine of cy pres is applied in cases: (1) when there is the presence of an otherwise valid charitable grant or trust; that is, one that has charity as its purpose and sufficiently offers benefits to an indefinite public; (2) when the specific intention of the settlor may not be legally or practically carried into effect; and (3) when there is exhibited a general charitable intent on the part of the settlor. Trammell v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 841</cite>, <cite class="app_court">199 S.E.2d 194</cite> (1973), for comment, see 10 Ga. St. B.J. 502 (1974) (decided under former Code 1933,

        It never has been considered as an objection to a charitable use,
       
       that it was general, and in some respects indefinite, unless there was an uncertainty as to the amount intended to be given, or the general object of the use was of so uncertain and indefinite a character, that it could not be executed.

       - Fact that those managing the hospital might not be able to receive and treat all of the applicants who constitute the class of beneficiaries of the benevolent scheme contained in the wills making the hospital the sole beneficiary would not be a reason for holding that the entire charitable scheme had failed, or for the application of the doctrine of cy pres. Reynolds v. Stanton, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 340</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E. 783</cite> (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       It is of the very essence of a charitable bequest that the objects to be benefited shall be to some extent indefinite. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When it was apparent from the entire will and codicil that a bequest to the governing authorities of a named association, "same being an Orphan's Home located at Macon, Georgia," was intended as a charitable trust for the benefit of orphans as a class, and that the designated "governing authorities" were merely to perform the office of trustee, the bequest was sufficiently definite and specific to be capable of execution, and since a trust will not fail for the want of a trustee, the legacy would not lapse merely because there may have been no such orphan's home and "governing authorities" as were mentioned in the will; in such case a court of equity could, by approximation, effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator in a manner most similar to that indicated by the testator. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the finding was authorized that hospital owned and maintained by the City of Augusta, commonly known as the "University Hospital of Augusta, Georgia," and thus designated in the will in question, was a charitable institution, owned by that city and maintained primarily for the gratuitous treatment of the sick and needy of the city and county, and that by that item the testator intended the estate therein bequeathed to be applied to the promotion of the charitable objects of such hospital, the charitable bequest, being valid, would be given effect. Moss v. Youngblood, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 689</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Cy pres will not be applied when
       
       there is demonstrated an intention of the settlor contrary to the inference of general charitable intent that the property should be applied exclusively to the purpose which is or has become impracticable or illegal. Such demonstration of a specific intent of the settlor as would result in a failure of the devise must be clear, definite, and unambiguous. In such event the trust will fail, and a resulting trust will be implied for the benefit of the testator or the testator's heirs. Trammell v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 841</cite>, <cite class="app_court">199 S.E.2d 194</cite> (1973), for comment, see 10 Ga. St. B.J. 502 (1974) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Courts of chancery (now equity) have jurisdiction to carry into effect charitable bequests, the object of which are definite and specific, and capable of being executed. Newson v. Starke, <cite class="ga_court">46 Ga. 88</cite> (1872) (decided under former Code 1868,
   §
   2432) Beall v. Ex'rs of Fox, <cite class="ga_court">4 Ga. 404</cite> (1848) See also.

       <p>
        <p>

        Court of equity has an inherent jurisdiction
       
       in cases of charitable bequests and devises, and cases of charity in the courts of equity in England were held valid, and executed independently of, and previous to the statute of 43d Elizabeth. Moss v. Youngblood, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 689</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the framers of the Code declared the courts of chancery (now equity) to have jurisdiction to enforce charitable bequests, declared what were charities and recognized the doctrine of cy pres, the framers intended to say something more than that courts of equity could enforce trusts; there was no propriety in giving this special jurisdiction or in defining charitable purposes if a bequest, for charitable purposes, to be valid, must have the same certainty and definiteness as to its objects and mode of division, as bequests, not for charitable purposes. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-815).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Special equity jurisdiction over charitable bequests grows out of the rule that, in cases of private right, courts will not enforce uncertainties, and that the parties at interest must be capable of definite ascertainment, but it is of the very nature of a charity that this is impossible, and from the most ancient times courts of chancery (now equity) in England have applied very different rules in determining the validity of charitable bequests from the rules applied to such as were not charitable. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section carries over former OCGA Sec. 53-2-101 with changes to reflect demonstrative testamentary gifts.
   The language of paragraph (c) is modified to clarify that, under certain circumstances, a creditor may proceed against a beneficiary when the executor has distributed testamentary gifts to the beneficiary.
   Similar concepts appear in Code Sec. 53-7-43.
   New subsection (e) clarifies that this statute is not intended to limit any of the rights to reimbursement that appear in federal tax law, such as Internal Revenue Code Sections 2205 through 2207B.
   Former OCGA Secs. 53-2-100 (relating to direction by testator that real property be converted to personalty) and 53-2-102 (relating to annuities or debts charged on land) are repealed.

       - Purpose of the General Assembly in passing this statute was to treat the costs of the administration of the estate as much a debt of the decedent as any other obligation to which the decedent may be subject. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 440</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E.2d 361</cite> (1968) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - While it is true that the commissions of the personal representative of a decedent do not, strictly speaking or primarily, constitute a debt due by the decedent, still the commissions due the personal representative of a decedent must be construed as part of the costs, and fall under the head of necessary expenses of administration. It is only another way of saying that of the property of the decedent, whether personalty or realty, is subject to the payment of the decedent's obligations. Colyer v. Huntley, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 332</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 901</cite> (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Immunity of real estate from sale to pay the commissions of an executor
       
       has been abrogated, and commissions of an executor or administrator are expenses of administration to which any property of a decedent is subject. Colyer v. Huntley, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 332</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 901</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-821).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Statute refers to "debts" owing by the deceased in his or her lifetime;
       
       it does not apply to such a demand where, long after the death of the testator, a bank fails and by operation of law there is a liability against the stock formerly owned by such testator and except as provided by law, there is no person authorized to contract a debt against an estate of a deceased person. State Banking Co. v. Hinton, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 68</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 42</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-821).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Words "debt" or "debts" of an estate, used in a refunding bond given to an executor "are obviously the debts of the decedent, due by him in his life time, and not the claims of the executor for remuneration and expenses of the estate." State Banking Co. v. Hinton, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 68</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 42</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-821).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Debt in its general sense is a specific sum of money which is due or owing
       
       from one person to another, and denotes not only the obligation of one person to pay, but the right of the other party to receive and enforce payment by judicial action. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 440</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E.2d 361</cite> (1968) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-821).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Taxes due a county or municipality
       
       come within the generally accepted meaning of personal debts, the collection of which is enforceable by appropriate judicial action. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 440</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E.2d 361</cite> (1968) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>

        Will provision directing that "all just debts be paid without unnecessary delay,"
       
       without more, is not an instruction to pay debts out of the gross estate rather than out of the residuum. American Cancer Soc'y v. Estate of Massell, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - As between the devisee of property on which there is a mortgage lien, and a devisee of other property, both being specific devises, the mortgage debt should be borne by the devisees of the mortgaged property. Raines v. Shipley, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 448</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 588</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        In regard to priority, debts and legacies stand on precisely the same footing and one can no more be diminished by the payment of commissions than the other. The expenses of administration, among which are the commissions of the representative, must first be paid whether enough be left to satisfy debts and legacies, or not. Alston v. United States, 228 F. Supp. 216 (N.D. Ga. 1964), aff'd, 349 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1965) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Legacy accepted by a widow under a will in lieu of other marital rights will not abate with other legacies to pay debts. Daniel v. Denham, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 544</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E.2d 906</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Testamentary legacy to a wife, specifically given in lieu of year's support, is entitled to preference over other legacies and devises although the legacy exceeds the value of the year's support. When the remaining estate is adequate to pay all the obligations of the estate, such legacy of the wife will not abate to pay the debts and obligations of the testator. Killingsworth v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">237 Ga. 544</cite>, <cite class="app_court">228 S.E.2d 901</cite> (1976) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Bequest accepted by a widow in lieu of year's support (or, previously, dower) has a priority over other bequests insofar as abatement is concerned. DuBose v. Box, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 101</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code 1933,

      <p>
       Paragraph (a) of this section carries over former OCGA Sec. 53-2-103, the Georgia anti-lapse statute, with slight modifications in the language.
   Paragraph (b) provides that, absent a clear intent to the contrary, the anti-lapse statute overrides the class gift rule so that the descendants of a predeceased class member may take that class member's share, pursuant to the provisions of this statute.
   Paragraph (c) provides that the descendants of a beneficiary who is treated as having predeceased the testator due to the statutes relating to divorce (Code Sec. 53-4-49) or to the killing of the testator by the beneficiary (OCGA Sec. 53-1-5) may not take that beneficiary's share under this statute unless they are also descendants of the testator.
   For example, if a testator's will leaves a testamentary gift to the testator's spouse but the testator and spouse are then divorced, Code Sec. 53-4-49 provides that the testator's spouse will be treated as having predeceased the testator.
   The children of the testator's spouse may take in place of this "predeceased" beneficiary but, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, only if they are also children of the testator.

        <p>
       - Former Civil Code 1910,
   §§
   3906 and 3907, dealing with lapsed legacies and the results of lapses, apply in cases involving an absolute legacy, without more, and a lapse; but the statutes in no way restrict the power of a testator to provide what shall become of the testator's estate in case of the death of a legatee named in it. Foster v. Hardee, <cite class="ga_court">135 Ga. 591</cite>, <cite class="app_court">69 S.E. 1110</cite> (1911) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It is familiar law that a legacy lapses by the death of the legatee or devisee
       
       in the life time of the testator, unless there be words of substitution or other provisions in the will, or by statute against a lapse. Collier v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 857</cite>, <cite class="app_court">59 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-812).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        At common law and under the law of this state before the Act of 1836
       
       (former Code 1933,
   §
   113-812), if the legatee died before the death of the testator the legacy lapsed, whether the legatee left issue or not. Now, if there be issue, the issue takes as substituting legatee. Sanders v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E.2d 294</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Testator's designation of beneficiaries by name generally indicates the testator intended the beneficiaries to take as individuals, but other language in the will may show a controlling intention that the individuals take as a class. Whitlock v. Lawson, <cite class="ga_court">260 Ga. 520</cite>, <cite class="app_court">397 S.E.2d 433</cite> (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Normally when a sole legatee under a will predeceases the testator and leaves no lineal descendants, a lapse of the legacy occurs, and the testator's estate passes to his or her heirs at law. However, a testator may prevent such a lapse by providing for the disposition of his or her estate in the event of the death of the legatee. Fiumefreddo v. Scudder, <cite class="ga_court">252 Ga. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">313 S.E.2d 683</cite> (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Statute provides what shall be done when a legatee who has already been determined predeceases the testator, and is intended to prevent the lapse of legacies. Johns v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 313</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ultimate effect of the statute is that the devise vests in the issue in the same proportions as if inherited directly from their deceased ancestor. Seymour v. Presley, <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 572</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 347</cite> (1977) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Those who are entitled to the devise will take as substituted beneficiaries,
       
       and not as heirs of the deceased legatee. Seymour v. Presley, <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 572</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 347</cite> (1977) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When the legatee dies before a contingent legacy is vested, there is nothing to transmit to the heirs. Allen v. Whitaker, <cite class="ga_court">34 Ga. 6</cite> (1864) (decided under former Code 1863,
   §
   2430).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Testator devised to J. $2,500.00, "provided he is in my employment at the time of my death." J. voluntarily severed business relations with the testator, and died before the death of the testator. In a suit by the testator's wife and children to recover the legacy, it was held that the legacy lapsed, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover. Johnson v. Folsom, <cite class="ga_court">145 Ga. 479</cite>, <cite class="app_court">89 S.E. 521</cite> (1916) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Statute does not apply when the legacy is made expressly contingent on the legatee surviving the testator and then the legatee predeceases the testator. Powell v. Watkins, <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 851</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E.2d 303</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       If they had been absolute and not limited, lapse would have been prevented by this statute, even though the beneficiaries are a class, where all the class predeceased the testator, as contrasted with the situation where one of a class survives, preventing lapse and the intervention of this statute; when one of a class survives, the rule of survivorship is applicable. Graham v. Patton, <cite class="ga_court">231 Ga. 391</cite>, <cite class="app_court">202 S.E.2d 58</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Statute has no application to the case where the legacy is to a class, and one or more of the class is in esse at the testator's death. It is only when all the members of the class predecease the testator that a lapse will be prevented. Davis v. Sanders, <cite class="ga_court">123 Ga. 177</cite>, <cite class="app_court">51 S.E. 298</cite> (1905) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

       A bequest to B and B's children is a bequest to a class. The class consists of B and such of B's children as survive the testator. B had a child who died before the testator, leaving issue, such issue would not share with B in the legacy under the law. Davis v.

       - When a testator named a testator's daughter and granddaughter in the testator's will, and stated the testator's intention to reward them individually for services they had rendered to the testator, the probate court erred by ruling that the testator intended a class, rather than individual, gift.

       - When a testator by the testator's will gave to one of the testator's daughters one-fourth of the testator's estate, and the daughter died before the death of the testator, leaving two children who survived her and the testator, the interest in the estate of the testator so given to this daughter, the same being absolute and without remainder or limitation, vested in such issue of the daughter as if inherited directly from their deceased grandfather. When a daughter of such deceased daughter of the testator died intestate, leaving no spouse or issue, but leaving her father and a sister as her sole heirs at law, such father and sister become entitled to any estate to which the deceased daughter was entitled either in right of her mother under the will of her grandfather or in her own right. Terry v. Chandler, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E. 572</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>
       When the grantee in the deed was also appointed by will, but died before the will became effective, leaving a child as the sole heir at law, who was in life at the death of the testator, the child was substituted as appointee by operation of law, and took the property in remainder, to the exclusion of the person to whom the named appointee had attempted to convey the property. Newton v. Bullard, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 448</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 614</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Unless there be something to indicate a contrary intent on the part of the testator, a devise or bequest to a named person, followed by a provision that if the person shall die childless the property shall pass to some other person, conveys to the person a fee, subject to be divested upon the person dying childless, or, as it is sometimes called, a base or qualified fee. Scranton-Lackawanna Trust Co. v. Bruen, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 872</cite>, <cite class="app_court">59 S.E.2d 397</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Devise of the residue of testator's estate to one person, and if the testator should die without children to another,
       
       conveys to the first devisee an estate in fee defeasible on the testator dying childless, and when, as here, the second devisee survived the testator, but predeceased the first devisee, upon the death of the first without child or children, the property passed to the heirs of the second devisee.

       - When the original will did not contain a residuary clause, and two daughters had died a short time prior to the execution of the codicil which provided that property given to one deceased daughter would descend to testator's other heirs, it was the manifest intention of the testator to, in effect, supply a residuary clause to the will.

       before the death of the testator, the interest in the estate given to this daughter, the same being absolute and without remainder or limitation, and this daughter having left issue living at the death of the testator, vested in such issue as if inherited directly from the deceased grandfather.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c04s53-4-64ol1a" target="_self">53-4-64(a)</a></cite> did not apply when the intent of the testator in drafting the will with regards to the testator's residual estate clearly expressed the intent that the bequests were contingent upon the beneficiaries surviving the testator; the bequests were conditional and lapsed when the unfulfilled condition attached to vesting.

       Motion for summary judgment of the testator's grandchildren in an action against their three uncles alleging that the grandchildren had an interest in the property that comprised the testator's estate was properly denied because the plain language of the will indicated that the testator did not intend that the bequests follow the law of intestacy, and the presumption in favor of a per stirpes distribution in the anti-lapse statute was overcome; the use of the phrase "per capita" in the will imposed a requirement that the individuals named, the testator's children, take the bequests in the children's own stead, and that the children had to survive the testator; and the grandchildren's mother, the testator's daughter, did not survive the testator.

       This section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-2-104.
   This section provides that lapsed gifts of real and personal property are treated the same in that they fall to the residue of the estate. This section also provides that a lapsed share of a residuary beneficiary will pass by intestacy unless there are other residuary beneficiaries surviving, in which case the predeceased beneficiary's share shall go to the other residuary beneficiaries in proportion to each beneficiary's share of the residuum.

        <p>
       Legacy is not a specific legacy, which will be adeemed when it does not bequeath a bond so labeled and sequestered as to be distinguished from another bond of a similar kind; it is a demonstrative legacy and does not fail if the subject matter is not in existence on the death of the testator. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

   113-817).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a will may reasonably be construed as showing an intention of the testator to bequeath to the six legatees something of the value of $1,000.00 each, and only three bonds remain, the will stating the $1,000.00 payments to be made from bonds, a fair and just execution of the will, as found by the trial court, would be to sell the three bonds and place the proceeds in the general assets and from that fund pay the six legatees $1,000.00 each. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-817).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Failure by the testator to particularize the $1,000.00 bonds bequeathed to stated children, forbid their being classified as specific legacies, and, consequently they do not fail but are payable as general legacies, $1,000.00 to each legatee, out of the general assets of the estate, including the proceeds from the sale of the three bonds on hand after the payment of debts, if any, and the expenses of administration. Young v. Young, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 659</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Meaning of ademption.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Ademption of a specific legacy is the extinction or withdrawal of it, in consequence of some act of the testator equivalent to its revocation, or clearly indicative of an intention to revoke. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">231 U.S. 753</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 322</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L. Ed. 467</cite> (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3908).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ademption is effected by the extinction of the thing or fund bequeathed, or by disposition of it subsequent to the will from which an intention that the legacy should fail is presumed. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">231 U.S. 753</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 322</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L. Ed. 467</cite> (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3908).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Term "ademption" is sometimes used as synonymous with satisfaction, but such use is inaccurate, as ademption operates independently of intention in case the specific thing given is, at the testator's death, no longer owned by the testator. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">231 U.S. 753</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 322</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L.

        <p>
       - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterward become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Thompson v. Long, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 718</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 651</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-817).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Standard for defining a "conveyance"
       
       is whether there has occurred a change in the testator's ownership sufficiently radical to manifest, as a matter of law, the testator's intention to revoke the specific devise. The term "conveyance" includes a single transaction by which a testator sells the testator's fee simple title to real estate in return for a security title to the real estate sold. Peacock v. Owens, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 458</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-817).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Ademption arises upon the conveyance of the specific property covered by the legacy,
       
       and rests upon a rule of law independent of any supposed actual intent of the testator; and in the absence of any facts which would bring the case within the exceptions set forth in statute, and in the absence of any provision in the will in contemplation of such a contingency, a trial court properly held that a devise had been wholly adeemed by reason of the conveyance of the realty involved, and since the testator died intestate as to this devise, that the proceeds thereof passed into the residuum of the estate. Thompson v. Long, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 718</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 651</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterwards become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Moncrief v. Shuman, <cite class="ga_court">169 Ga. 217</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E. 98</cite> (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3908).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a testator conveys to a third party specific property devised and the will contains no provision for such a contingency, there can be no inquiry into a testator's intention in adeeming specifically bequeathed property. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E.2d 261</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although a testator failed to form a limited partnership prior to the testator's death, such that a devise of member certificates was without effect and was adeemed, the business property that was devised to beneficiaries was not limited to that entity. Simmons v. England, <cite class="ga_app_court">323 Ga. App. 251</cite>, <cite class="app_court">746 S.E.2d 862</cite> (2013).

       - When wife devised one-half interest in real estate to husband by specific devise, but did not devise the proceeds of its sale to husband, the specific devise was adeemed by alienation when testator sold the fee simple title in return for a down payment, note, and security title. Powell v. Thorsen, <cite class="ga_court">253 Ga. 572</cite>, <cite class="app_court">322 S.E.2d 261</cite> (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - There are four exceptions to the rule that ademption occurs when a testator conveys to another the specific property bequeathed, those exceptions are: (1) where the testator afterwards becomes possessed of the same property; (2) where the attempt to convey fails; (3) where the testator exchanges the property for other of like character; and (4) where the testator merely changes the investment of a fund bequeathed. Lang v. Vaughn, <cite class="ga_court">137 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E. 270</cite>, 40 L.R.A. (n.s.) 542, 1913B Ann. Cas. 52 (1912) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A specific devise is adeemed when, after the execution of the will, the testator "conveys" to another the specific property devised unless one of the following four exceptions applies: reacquisition by the testator; failure of the conveyance; receipt of like property in exchange for the devised property, and mere change in the investment of a fund. Peacock v. Owens, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 458</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Statement that "the law deems the intention to be,"
       
       etc., in the statute, shows that if the testator makes no provision in the testator's will on the subject, expressive of the testator's intent in case of a sale or the like, the law declares what it deems is the testator's legal intent; or, in other words, provides what shall be the result in such case. This excludes the idea that in every case what the law deems to be the intent has no force, and that the courts will go afield hunting for an intent expressed in parol or to be gathered from conduct or acts of the testator after the making of the will. Lang v. Vaughn, <cite class="ga_court">137 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E. 270</cite>, 40 L.R.A. (n.s.) 542, 1913B Ann. Cas. 52 (1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - When specifically bequeathed capital stock is sold for money and the testator independently reinvests in stocks and certificates there is no "exchange" of property bequeathed for other of like character, as contemplated by the statute, so far as to except it from operation of the principle of ademption. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E.2d 261</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Bequest of capital stock for the use and benefit of testator's wife that is subsequently sold by the testator prior to testator's death is not a fund bequested within the meaning of this statute.

        <p>
       - Meaning and intent of this statute is that it is designed for the purpose of making sure that a legatee shall not be permitted to hold onto a legatee's own legacy under a will and at the same time deprive another legatee of property given the legatee under the will. Holliday v. Pope, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 301</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 350</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>

       Statute is not intended and should not be construed to mean that a legatee must speculate by electing to take what the legatee believes to be a good claim to property, and at that period of pure chance relinquish the legatee's unquestioned title to the property under the will. On the other hand, the intent of this statute is to prevent such legatee from taking both the property going to the legatee under the will and property which the legatee claims. Holliday v.

       - Plaintiff would not be compelled to elect between a legacy and a "mere claim" to property until after there has been an adjudication of the question whether or not plaintiff is in fact the owner of an interest in the property disposed of by the will, and then only in the event this issue is determined in plaintiff's favor; since, if plaintiff were first compelled to elect, and plaintiff should for any reason fail in the trial to establish plaintiff's claim, there would be no defeated or disappointed legatees to compensate, but, on the contrary, the other legatees would get the very property plaintiff claimed. Rieves v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 372</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A case of election only arises when
       
       a person is entitled to one of two benefits to each of which plaintiff has the legal title, and an election can exist only when there is a choice between two or more inconsistent remedies actually existing at the time of election. Rieves v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 372</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        To raise a case of election a person must be entitled to one of two benefits,
       
       to each of which one has legal title, but to enforce both would be unconscientious and inequitable to others having claims upon the same property or fund. One must have legal title to both benefits, and have right to enforce either at one's election. Holliday v. Pope, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 301</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 350</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - When a testator, after devising property owned by the testator to one beneficiary, assumes to devise to another property belonging to the first devisee, the devisee of the property owned by the testator, if one accepts the devise with knowledge of the facts, is precluded from asserting a claim to one's own property devised to the other beneficiary. The beneficiary must elect between keeping one's own and taking what is given by the will. Rieves v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 372</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Choice is compulsory between two inconsistent rights or claims when there is a clear intention of the testator that the beneficiary shall not enjoy both. Rieves v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Doctrine of election as applied to wills, against one claiming inconsistent benefits, arises when the testator "has attempted to give property not his own, and has given a benefit to a person to whom that property belongs," in which case "the devisee or legatee shall elect either to take under or against the will." It is applicable when the instrument confers upon one a benefit while attempting to dispose of one's own property, in which event such person must elect whether to accept the benefit under the instrument or retain one's property. However, this doctrine does not apply when testamentary disposition describes no specific property so as to identify the property with that of the claimant, but describes the property only generally, as "all my real and personal property and all property of every kind and character owned by me at my death," since the testator would be presumed to have intended to bequeath only what the testator actually owned and could lawfully dispose of.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Specific performance of an alleged contract to will certain property in return for services rendered testator would not be decreed if to do so would allow the petitioner to acquire both that property and the property already given to one under the will. Holliday v. Pope, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 301</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 350</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Condition contemplated by statute, when an election is mandatory, will exist in a suit for specific performance of a contract to will certain property to petitioner who was given other less desirable property in the will, only when by a judgment of the court the petitioner acquires legal title to the property which one seeks; and by the very act of praying for and obtaining such a decree of title the petitioner will have thereby made an election to renounce the petitioner's legacy under the will, and the requirements of statute will thus be satisfied.

     Process of probating a will in Georgia is essentially a formal validation
    
    of the property interests which came into existence upon the death of the testator. Jenkins v.

       - Probate court has exclusive jurisdiction of the probate of wills, and a will cannot be proved and admitted in evidence in a contest under it in the superior court. Elliott v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 399</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Court of equity is without jurisdiction to determine the validity of wills and to cancel them. Elliott v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 399</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Court of ordinary (now probate court) has original and exclusive jurisdiction, in the first instance, of the probate of wills; and a court of equity in the exercise of its equity powers has no jurisdiction to enjoin the custodian of an alleged will from offering the will for probate, or for any reason to decree cancellation of an alleged will on which no action has been taken by the court of ordinary (now probate court). The rule that equity seeks to do complete justice will not bring into equitable jurisdiction matters of which another court has exclusive jurisdiction. Furr v. Jordan, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 862</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 861</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - It being within the power of the judge of the probate court of any county to compel the filing in the judge's office of any paper purporting to be the last will and testament of a deceased person who at the time of death resided in such county, and the probate court having original and exclusive jurisdiction in the first instance of the probate of all wills, the superior court, in the exercise of the court's equity powers, has no jurisdiction to enjoin the custodian of an alleged will from offering the will for probate, nor to decree, for any reason, the cancellation of an alleged will upon which no action has ever been taken by the probate court. Elliott v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 399</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When will was offered for probate in the court of ordinary (now probate court) of a certain county, as the court having jurisdiction, solely upon the ground that the decedent was domiciled in that county at the time of the decedent's death, and there was no contention that the evidence did not establish without dispute all averments contained in the application for probate, it was not cause for reversal for any reason assigned, that the court in directing the verdict in favor of probate included direction for a special finding that the decedent was a resident of and was domiciled in Fulton County at the time of the decedent's death as a general verdict for the propounders would necessarily have implied the jurisdictional fact that the decedent was so domiciled; and it did not appear that the caveator was harmed by the direction of such special finding, or by its existence as a part of the verdict. Hungerford v. Spalding, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 2</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Probate courts have general jurisdiction of the granting or revocation of letters of administration, and therefore judgment granting letters as to a particular estate cannot be impeached collaterally on the ground that the decedent resided in a different county; such a judgment must be attacked in the court where it was rendered, especially where the judgment itself recites the fact that the deceased was late of that county. Davis v. Tyson, <cite class="ga_app_court">60 Ga. App. 714</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 704</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Probate court did not err in finding that the testators were domiciled in Newton County at the time of the testators' deaths as the testators resided in a nursing home in that county and had no plans to return to the testators' Fulton County home or to the appellant's residence in Rockdale County and, thus, the probate court properly exercised jurisdiction over the petition to probate the testators' wills.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Mere ownership of real estate in a certain county would not confer jurisdiction upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) of such county to probate an alleged will, unless the decedent died a nonresident of this state, since the probate of a will must be made in the county of the residence of the alleged testator if a resident of this state; and, if not a resident of this state, the will may be probated in any county where real estate belonging to the testator is situated.

       Issue of devisavit vel non does not include any issue as to the title or the ownership of property, and a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a superior court on appeal from a court of ordinary (now probate court) has no jurisdiction to try and determine the question of the validity or invalidity of a contract by legatees disposing of property contrary to the terms of a will offered for probate.

       - Court of ordinary (now probate court) is a court of general jurisdiction, and, unless want of jurisdiction appears on the face of the record, its judgment cannot be collaterally attacked.

       - When an appeal is taken to the superior court from a judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) admitting or refusing the probate of a paper as a will, that court becomes quoad hoc a probate court, and in trying the appeal the superior court cannot go beyond the jurisdiction of the court of ordinary (now probate court) as respects rights, and can deal with no question of merits, except such as could have been raised in the primary court.

        Renunciation
       
       is an act whereby a person, named in a will as executor, declines to take on personally the burden of that office. The act is, therefore, predicated on an existing office. It presupposes the existence of the will. If no will has been made, there is no executorship to renounce. Nor until it is shown that there is a will, can it appear that there is a renunciable executorship. Wheeler v. Wheeler, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 831</cite>, <cite class="app_court">62 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Georgia Supreme Court has found that only those who have some interest in the will or estate which will be affected or concluded by probate have a right to file a caveat. Georgia cases have recognized those interested persons with standing to caveat a will to include heirs, a purchaser from an heir, a judgment creditor of an heir, an administrator appointed for the testator before the discovery of the will, and persons claiming under an earlier will. Ray v. Stevens, <cite class="ga_court">295 Ga. 895</cite>, <cite class="app_court">764 S.E.2d 809</cite> (2014).

       - Widow is entitled to no year's support unless she applies for it prior to her death and prior to her remarriage, and thus, it is apparent on its face that her right is a terminable one. United States v. Edmondson, 331 F.2d 676 (5th Cir. 1964) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - When a widow dies pending proceedings to have a year's support set aside to her out of her husband's estate, a return of the appraisers setting aside a year's support is void. May v. Braddock, <cite class="ga_app_court">92 Ga. App. 302</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E.2d 539</cite> (1955).

        <p>

        Right to a year's support can be waived
       
       if application is not made while the spouse is alive and widowed.
   However, there is no basis to conclude that the year's support, if applied for, lapses if the award is not finalized before the death of the claimant. Wigley v.

       This section protects innocent purchasers who acquire property within the statutory five-year period for probating a will. If the purchasers acquired the property from the heirs of the testator, they are not protected from actions by the executor or beneficiaries under a will probated after the purchase unless an order declaring that no administration is necessary was granted prior to the purchase in accordance with Article 4 of Chapter 2 of this Title.
   Persons who purchased from the testator's spouse or children are protected only if an order granting Year's Support to the spouse or children was entered in accordance with Chapter 3 of this Title.
   Persons who purchased from an administrator or the heirs are protected if the administrator was duly appointed prior to the purchase in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter 6 of this Title.

       - Except as to proof in solemn form after probate in common form, there is no statute of limitation upon the time within which a will may be probated, and if a will is finally offered, the will's proof and record cannot be denied upon the ground of delay by the propounder, nor because of acts on the propounder's part from which an estoppel might arise in other cases.

       When it did not appear from the record that the possessor of the will and caveator was in any way responsible for the ordinary's (now probate judge) failure to send up the will and codicils with the other papers on file in the ordinary's court, the trial court did not err in overruling the motion of the proponent to dismiss the appeal of the caveator.

       This statute is a branch of the statute of distributions,

       Provision for a year's support is a branch of the statute of distribution,

        <p>
       - In Georgia, the rules of inheritance, as fixed by statute, use the words "child" or "children" without mentioning therein an adopted child or children. Nevertheless, by virtue of the adoption statutes an adopted child or children take under the statute of descent as natural children of lawful birth. For example, under the rules of inheritance, upon the death of the husband without lineal descendants, the wife is his sole heir, and upon the payment of his debts, if any, may take possession of his estate without administration. But, under the provisions of the adoption statute and the rights of inheritance conferred by it, an adopted child of the deceased husband, like a lineal descendant of the deceased, will deprive the wife of the right to take his entire estate as sole heir at law, without administration; and this is true because the statute fixing the rules of inheritance must be construed in pari materia with the adoption statute. A similar situation exists as to the statute providing for a year's support to the widow and minor children of a deceased husband and father. Thornton v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 714</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 186</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When caveators produce no evidence as to the standing of the family or the manner in which the deceased and the applicant had lived prior to death, caveators have failed to produce one of the necessary elements of evidence to show that the amount set aside to the applicant was more than the applicant was entitled to as a year's support.

        Statute does not require notice to the applicant for a year's support
       
       of the filing of a caveat to the application; it is the duty of the applicant to keep informed as to regular proceedings in the case, and any ignorance of such proceedings, resulting from failure to perform that duty, will not afford ground for ousting the court of the court's jurisdiction to try the issue raised by the caveat, and to set aside the judgment upon that issue.

       - Although a judgment for year's support would have ranked ahead of payment of debts, the mere fact that plaintiffs by relationship occupied a position which would entitle the plaintiffs to apply for and obtain such a judgment, would not entitle the plaintiffs, without having it allowed in the only way provided by law to have a recovery against the administrator and the administrator's surety. A year's support to be enforceable must be manifest in a judgment. It is not in existence as such until such judgment. Howard v.

       A widow who applies for and obtains a year's support for herself and her minor children living with her, acts for the minor children as well as herself. In such case the minor children are as plaintiffs, and the judgment obtained is in their behalf. The result is that both widows and their minor children who invoke and obtain judgments granting them property out of the estates of deceased husbands and fathers cannot afterwards repudiate the judgments which they have secured for their own benefit. The position thus occupied by the minors living with their mother is very different from that of creditors, or adult heirs such as other children who were sui juris when the support was set apart.

       Judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) confirming and admitting to record the return of duly appointed appraisers, setting apart to a widow and minor children a year's support consisting of described property, "subject to just debts owed by" the deceased husband and father, is not void on the ground that the property has been set apart subject to existing debts of the deceased.

        <p>
       - Administrators or executors, plaintiffs in an action, are bound by their admissions in relation to the subject matter of the action. Sample v. Lipscomb, <cite class="ga_court">18 Ga. 687</cite> (1855);(decided under former law).

        <p>
       Admissions or declarations of an executor are only competent evidence as to the executor's own acts after the executor becomes clothed with such trust, and do not bind the estate which the executor represents insofar as they refer to what was told to the executor by the testator during life. Godbee v. Sapp, <cite class="ga_court">53 Ga. 283</cite> (1874) (decided under former Code 1873,

   2437).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When admissions of an executor were as to the conduct or acts of the executor as to matters relevant to the issue on trial, the admissions were admissible on the issue of devisavit vel non. Fletcher v. Gillespie, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 377</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 45</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       It is not the function of one nominated as executor to preclude the rights either of legatees or heirs, by making voluntary allegations such as would foreclose the rights of either. Mitchell v. Arnall, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E.2d 258</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - Admissions of a person who was the propounder of the paper offered for probate, the nominated executor therein, and legatee under the same were competent evidence. Harvey v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">12 Ga. 69</cite> (1852) (decided under former law).

       Admissions of an executor, who is a legatee to the extent of a life interest in the whole of testator's property, and the propounder of the will, are competent evidence upon the trial of a caveat to that will. Williamson v. Nabers, <cite class="ga_court">14 Ga. 286</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Admissions of an administrator, made before the administrator was appointed such, are not admissible to prejudice or affect the rights and interests of the heirs and creditors of the estate represented by the administrator. Thomasson v. Driskell, <cite class="ga_court">13 Ga. 253</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

       On the trial of issue of devisavit vel non, the admission of an executor before qualification is admissible to impeach the will when such admission is in reference to the conduct or acts of the executor as to some matter relevant to the issue. Dennis v. Weekes, <cite class="ga_court">51 Ga. 24</cite> (1974) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Statute is a branch of the statute of distributions,

        <p>
       - In Georgia, the rules of inheritance, as fixed by statute, use the words "child" or "children" without mentioning therein an adopted child or children. Nevertheless, by virtue of the adoption statutes an adopted child or children take under the statute of descent as natural children of lawful birth. For example, under the rules of inheritance, upon the death of the husband without lineal descendants, the wife is his sole heir, and upon the payment of his debts, if any, may take possession of his estate without administration. But, under the provisions of the adoption statute and the rights of inheritance conferred by it, an adopted child of the deceased husband, like a lineal descendant of the deceased, will deprive the wife of the right to take his entire estate as sole heir at law, without administration; and this is true because the statute fixing the rules of inheritance must be construed in pari materia with the adoption statute. A similar situation exists as to the statute providing for a year's support to the widow and minor children of a deceased husband and father. Thornton v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 714</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 186</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When caveators produce no evidence as to the standing of the family or the manner in which the deceased and the applicant had lived prior to death, caveators have failed to produce one of the necessary elements of evidence to show that the amount set aside to the applicant was more than the applicant was entitled to as a year's support.

        <p>

        Statute does not require notice to the applicant for a year's support
       
       of the filing of a caveat to the application; it is the duty of the applicant to keep informed as to regular proceedings in the case, and any ignorance of such proceedings, resulting from failure to perform that duty, will not afford ground for ousting the court of the court's jurisdiction to try the issue raised by the caveat, and to set aside the judgment upon that issue.

        <p>
       - Although a judgment for year's support would have ranked ahead of payment of debts, the mere fact that plaintiffs by relationship occupied a position which would entitle the plaintiffs to apply for and obtain such a judgment, would not entitle the plaintiffs, without having it allowed in the only way provided by law to have a recovery against the administrator and the administrator's surety. A year's support to be enforceable must be manifest in a judgment. It is not in existence as such until such judgment. Howard v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 505</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E.2d 865</cite> (1941) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) allowing a year's support is a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction,

       When no caveat to widow's application for support was filed, and citation had issued and been published as required by law, a court of equity would not set aside the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) for irregularities. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       A widow who applies for and obtains a year's support for herself and her minor children living with her, acts for the minor children as well as herself. In such case the minor children are as plaintiffs, and the judgment obtained is in their behalf. The result is that both widows and their minor children who invoke and obtain judgments granting them property out of the estates of deceased husbands and fathers cannot afterwards repudiate the judgments which they have secured for their own benefit. The position thus occupied by the minors living with their mother is very different from that of creditors, or adult heirs such as other children who were sui juris when the support was set apart. Jones v. Federal Land Bank, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 419</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E.2d 52</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) confirming and admitting to record the return of duly appointed appraisers, setting apart to a widow and minor children a year's support consisting of described property, "subject to just debts owed by" the deceased husband and father, is not void on the ground that the property has been set apart subject to existing debts of the deceased. Griffin v. Wood, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 510</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 921</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the final judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) setting apart a year's support has been rendered, it is too late to attack that judgment. Smith v.

       Judgment approving the return of commissioners setting aside a year's support, when all the proceedings are regular, cannot be attacked as fraudulent because interested parties could have successfully resisted the judgment had the parties interposed timely objection.

       Judgment awarding the year's support to the widow bears the presumption that everything necessary to authorize the judgment was properly done.

        <p>
       - In a proceeding to set apart a year's support, the court of ordinary (now probate court) is a court of general jurisdiction as to such matter. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In response to a widow's application for year's support, the probate court could only award her property belonging to her husband's estate and had no jurisdiction to determine whether the property was vested in the widow, her husband's estate, or in a bankruptcy estate. McClure v. Mason, <cite class="ga_app_court">228 Ga. App. 797</cite>, <cite class="app_court">493 S.E.2d 16</cite> (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>

        Original jurisdiction of a court of ordinary (now probate court)
       
       in a year's support proceeding is exclusive, and fact that the estate is in the hands of a trustee or receiver will not affect the right of the widow to proceed for it.

   This section clarifies that an executor under a will that is probated in common form acts in a manner similar to a temporary administrator of an intestate estate in that the executor is protected in the performance of the ordinary duties of collecting and preserving the estate assets and paying debts of the estate, but not in distributing property of the estate.
   This section also continues the protection of bona fide purchasers.

       - Under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-601 a will was proved in common form by a single witness and admitted to record after it was exhibited or presented to the judge, and under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602, the will was proved in solemn form by all the witnesses and ordered to record, after due notice of the proceeding to all heirs; the presentation or exhibition of the will to the ordinary is necessary both in proving the will in common form and in proving the will in solemn form. Carmichael v. Mobley, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga. App. 574</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 418</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-601).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Will is proven in common form when the executor presents the will before the judge,
       
       and in the absence of, and without citing the parties interested, produced witnesses to prove the will. In some courts the will may be proven in this form by the oath of the executor without more. Such probate, with good reason, seems to be discouraged in the states very generally. Brown v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">13 Ga. 171</cite> (1853) (decided under former law).

       - The usual procedure is for the complaining party at interest to make application to the ordinary (now probate judge) for a citation to issue calling on the propounder to prove the will in solemn form, and then, if probate of the will in solemn form is refused, the effect is to set aside probate in common form and declare an intestacy. Abercrombie v. Hair, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 728</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 447</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Nature of proceeding.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Under statutory law, a proceeding to probate a will in common form is a probate proceeding pure and simple, the probate and record not being conclusive upon anyone interested in the estate adversely to the will, and, if afterwards set aside, not protecting the executor in any of the executor's acts further than the payment of the debts of the estate. Brodhead v. Shoemaker, 44 F. 518, <cite class="lra">111 L.R.A. 567</cite> (N.D. Ga. 1890) (decided under former Code 1882,
   §
   2423).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Probate in common form affords but little protection to anyone;
       
       and the executor acts at the executor's peril under such a probate, except in the payment of debts of the estate. Jones v. Dean, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">3 S.E.2d 894</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-601).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probate in common form may be made in vacation without notice on the testimony of a single witness and the will admitted to record, and the executor may begin to act under the will, but this probate is not conclusive on anyone adversely interested. Heath v. Jones, 168 F.2d 460 (5th Cir. 1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-601).

       <p>
        <p>
       - While a judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) probating a will in common form is not without limited effect and after seven years becomes conclusive upon all persons not under disability, yet until then it is "not conclusive upon anyone interested in the estate adversely to the will, and such person . . . may require proof in solemn form and interpose a caveat." Abercrombie v. Hair, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 728</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 447</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Under former Code 1933,

   113-601 a will was proved in common form by a single witness and admitted to record after it was exhibited or presented to the judge, and under former Code 1933,
   §

Carmichael v. Mobley, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga. App. 574</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 418</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Under statutory law, a proceeding to probate a will in common form is a probate proceeding pure and simple, the probate and record not being conclusive upon anyone interested in the estate adversely to the will, and, if afterwards set aside, not protecting the executor in any of the executor's acts further than the payment of the debts of the estate.

        Probate in common form affords but little protection to anyone;

       After the lapse of seven years, a judgment of probate becomes conclusive as to the factum of due execution of the will, unless the fact appears on the will's face that it was not executed pursuant to law.

       <p>
        <p>
       Under statutory law, both adults and minors have seven years after the probate in common form within which to call for proof in solemn form. If a minor arrives at majority during the seven years next succeeding the probate, and at a time when more than four years of that period remains, the minor has, after arrival at age, the remainder of the seven-year period within which to file a contest. If the minor arrives at majority after the expiration of the seven years, or at a time during the seven-year period when less than four years remains, the minor has only four years after reaching majority to file the contest. Sutton v. Hancock, <cite class="ga_court">118 Ga. 436</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E. 504</cite> (1903) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

        <p>
       While a judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) probating a will in common form is not without limited effect and after seven years becomes conclusive upon all persons not under disability, yet until then it is "not conclusive upon anyone interested in the estate adversely to the will, and such person . . . may require proof in solemn form and interpose a caveat." Abercrombie v. Hair, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 728</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 447</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Caveator was party and could not later protest.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - It was proper to dismiss without a hearing a caveat to a will based on lack of testamentary capacity because it was clear that the caveator's allegations were fatally deficient. The caveator had not sought to set aside the probate court's order probating the will; by signing a letter of assent, the caveator had consented to the immediate probate of the will, which established, among other things, that the testator had sufficient mental capacity; and although the caveator contended that distribution of the estate should be governed by an alleged contract between the parties, the caveator had not appealed the probate court's finding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the alleged contract. In re Estate of Brice, <cite class="ga_app_court">288 Ga. App. 449</cite>, <cite class="app_court">654 S.E.2d 420</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Probate of a will does not decide upon the right of disposal;
       
       it decides merely upon the factum of the will. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Court of ordinary (now probate court) has original and exclusive jurisdiction
       
       over the probate of wills; and the issue to be decided on an application for probate is devisavit vel non, and does not include any issue as to the validity of the testator's title. Cone v. Johnston, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 420</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E.2d 545</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In a proceeding to probate a will in solemn form, the only issue
       
       is devisavit vel non, will or not. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 175</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Fact that the issue in an application for probate is devisavit vel non does not mean that proof of occurrences subsequent to the proper execution of a valid will that, in law, voids the document is inadmissible. Lawson v. Hurt, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">125 S.E.2d 480</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Issue of devisavit vel non does not include any issue as to the title
       
       or the ownership of property, and a court of ordinary (now probate court), and a superior court on appeal from that court, has no jurisdiction to try and determine the question of the validity or invalidity of a contract by legatees disposing of property contrary to the terms of a will offered for probate. Cone v. Johnston, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 420</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E.2d 545</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Propounder who offered a will for probate
       
       assumed the non-shifting burden of persuasion as to the validity of that document, including the requirement of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the signature was that of the decedent. Heard v. Lovett, <cite class="ga_court">273 Ga. 111</cite>, <cite class="app_court">538 S.E.2d 434</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It was error for the superior court to direct a verdict in favor of a propounder because under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c04s53-4-46" target="_self">53-4-46</a></cite> the propounder was required to prove that the propounder's mother did not deliberately discard or destroy the original of the will with the purpose of revoking the will, but the propounder did not satisfy the propounder's statutory duty, and the propounder should have filed a petition to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original, which would have notified the probate court of the appropriate standards and burdens of proof; the plain language of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c04s53-4-46" target="_self">53-4-46</a></cite>(b) clearly requires that the presumption of intent to revoke be rebutted in order for a copy of a will to be probated, and Georgia law does not allow a propounder to probate a will without fulfilling the pertinent evidentiary requirements, even when no caveat has been filed. Tudor v. Bradford, <cite class="ga_court">289 Ga. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">709 S.E.2d 235</cite> (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It was error for the superior court to direct a verdict in favor of a propounder because pursuant to current Ga. Unif. Prob. Ct. R. 5.3.3 the propounder was required to provide a caption on the propounder's petition to probate a will purported to be the last will and testament of the propounder's mother that set out the exact nature of the pleading or the type of petition, which was to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original; however, not only did the propounder fail to caption the propounder's petition properly, the propounder also failed to make any interlineations or provide the requisite additional information in the petition as required by Georgia Probate Court Standard Form 5 to use that form to probate a copy of the mother's will. Tudor v. Bradford, <cite class="ga_court">289 Ga. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">709 S.E.2d 235</cite> (2011).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c04s53-4-24ol1c" target="_self">53-4-24(c)</a></cite>, when a will is self-proved, it "may be admitted to probate without the testimony of any subscribing witness." In fact, compliance with the requirements of execution are presumed without the live testimony or affidavits of witnesses; that is, under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c05s53-5-21ol1a" target="_self">53-5-21(a)</a></cite>, the affidavit creates a presumption regarding the prima facie case, subject to rebuttal. Singelman v. Singelman, <cite class="ga_court">273 Ga. 894</cite>, <cite class="app_court">548 S.E.2d 343</cite> (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a sister's challenge to her brother's will, the probate court erred in finding that the will was not sufficiently proven due to the executor's failure to produce the witnesses; the will had an attached self-proving affidavit and could be admitted without other proof that formalities of execution were met, pursuant to O.C.G.A.

        Statute prescribes certain essential prerequisites
       
       before a valid judgment probating a will in solemn form can be rendered. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 224</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 340</cite> (1961) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Application to probate in solemn form affords opportunity to all parties
       
       interested for a hearing by the court on any objection the parties may have to the probate of the will, and those with notice are concluded by the judgment of probate. While the caveator has the burden of proving the grounds of the caveat, the initial burden is upon the propounder to prove the testamentary capacity of the testator, and that the testator acted freely and voluntarily in the execution of the will. Jones v. Dean, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">3 S.E.2d 894</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Proper attestation clause presumes statutory execution of will.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Attestation clause stating that testator signed will "in the presence of witnesses who, at her request and in her presence and in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses the same day and date," is a sufficient attestation clause such that its introduction into evidence raised a presumption of the proper execution of the will. Thornton v. Hulme, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 480</cite>, <cite class="app_court">128 S.E.2d 744</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Judgment of probate and domicile is a judgment in rem
       
       and therefore, as an act of the sovereign power, its effect cannot be disputed within the jurisdiction. Riley v. New York Trust Co., <cite class="us_code">315 U.S. 343</cite>, <cite class="s_court">62 S. Ct. 608</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">86 L. Ed. 885</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>

        Probate of later will requires
       
       prior reversal of judgment ordering probate of first will. When a person who filed a caveat to a will which was probated in solemn form thereafter attempted to probate an alleged later will, without setting aside or reversing the judgment ordering the probate of the first will in solemn form, a verdict was demanded against probate of the alleged later will. Byrd v. Riggs, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 930</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 774</cite> (1953), for comment, see 16 Ga. B.J. 338 (1954); 18 Ga.

       - Proof of the execution of a will in case of probate in solemn form and proof of the execution of a will in a case to establish and probate a copy when the will is missing may be made in precisely the same manner and by the same character of evidence; and in both evidence other than the testimony of the subscribing witnesses, after the available witnesses have been produced at the hearing, is admissible for the purpose of proving the execution of the will, and in each this may be done despite the testimony of the witnesses against the will. Fletcher v. Gillespie, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 377</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 45</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Production of witnesses indispensable to prima facie case by propounder.

        <p>
       - Probate in solemn form requires that "all the witnesses" be produced, if the witnesses be in life and within the jurisdiction of the court; if a will has four witnesses, all must be produced if the witnesses are accessible. Bloodworth v. McCook, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 53</cite>, <cite class="app_court">17 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1941) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602); Miller v. Miller, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 224</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 340</cite> (1961);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       To make out a prima facie case, where a caveat has been filed and to be entitled to a judgment of probate in solemn form, the propounder must introduce at the hearing all the subscribing witnesses, if living and accessible, or proof of their signatures, if dead or inaccessible. Spivey v. Spivey, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-602).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If a caveat has been filed all subscribing witnesses must be introduced for examination, even though the propounder knows that the witnesses' testimony will be unfavorable to the propounder, and if some or all of the subscribing witnesses cannot testify as to the testamentary capacity and mental condition of the testator, or give testimony adverse to the propounder and favorable to the caveator, such failure of memory or hostility will not necessarily defeat the will, since the propounder may make the proof required by law by other witnesses who can testify as to the essential facts, and upon sufficient proof being made the will may be probated. Spivey v. Spivey, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Upon the trial of an application to prove a will in solemn form, the witnesses are, all of them, unless accounted for, indispensably necessary witnesses. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 224</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 340</cite> (1961) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       When four persons affixed their signature below the signature of the testator and three were present at the probate proceedings and testified (the fourth was out of the state and her signature was proved by her mother), all four persons were properly accounted for.

       - Main reason of the rule for calling all witnesses in a proceeding for probate in solemn form is to give the other party an opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses. Miller v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When propounder, in will contest, established the factum of the will and codicil and by proof of the attendant circumstances indicating mental capacity and freedom of will and action, a prima facie case for the validity of the will and codicil was made such as would shift the burden upon the caveator to show that the instruments were invalid by reason of a degree of undue influence exercised upon the testator, such as would deprive the testator of the testator's own free will and substitute therefor that of the beneficiary. Ehlers v. Rheinberger, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 226</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Because testimony from the attorney who prepared and witnessed the decedent's self-proved will, an associate who also witnessed the will's execution, and the legal secretary who notarized the will supported a finding that the decedent had the testamentary capacity at the time the will was executed, the trial court did not err in admitting the will to probate.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c03s53-3-13" target="_self">53-3-13</a></cite> required the propounder of any will to give notice to the propounders and beneficiaries of any other wills of the testator offered for probate in the same county. This duty of notice does not end on the date of the filing of the first will for probate. It is a duty which continues until a will is admitted to probate. Garner v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">260 Ga. 866</cite>, <cite class="app_court">400 S.E.2d 925</cite> (1991) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        Judgment of probate in solemn form, after due notice, is conclusive
       
       and is not subject to collateral attack in any other court. Rigby v. Powell, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 158</cite>, <cite class="app_court">210 S.E.2d 696</cite> (1974), overruled on other grounds, Wilson v.

       - In the probate of a will in solemn form, the absence from the state, at the time of probate, of an heir at law who resided within the state, solely because of service in the armed forces of the United States, does not change his domicile or residence so as to authorize service on him of a notice of probate by publication.

     <p>
      When it appears that a will cannot be proved as otherwise provided by law because at the time the will is offered for probate one or more of the subscribing witnesses to the will is dead or mentally or physically incapable of testifying or otherwise inaccessible, the court may admit the will to probate in common or solemn form upon the testimony in person or by affidavit or by deposition of at least two credible disinterested witnesses that the signature to the will is that of the individual whose will it purports to be or upon other sufficient proof of such signature. This Code section shall not preclude the court, in its discretion, from requiring, in addition, the testimony in person or by deposition of any available subscribing witness or proof of such other pertinent facts and circumstances as the court may deem necessary to admit the will to probate.

       - Because the probate court erred in finding that a settlement agreement between heirs to their decedent parent's estate was enforceable, given that a disabled sibling's interests were not represented, and no evidence was presented that a non-disabled sibling assented to or participated in the agreement, the court erred in approving the agreement, warranting a finding that the agreement be set aside.

       - Probate court did not err in authorizing payment by the estate of an executor's expenses in probating a testator's will because there was evidence that the executor had reasonable grounds to believe that the will the executor propounded was valid and operative, and the probate court found no evidence of any undue influence affecting the testator in the execution of the propounded will, much less undue influence of appellee on the testator.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c05s53-5-26" target="_self">53-5-26</a></cite> was not prohibited by the supersedeas imposed by the filing of the initial notice of appeal because the order permitted the executor to have the estate pay expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the executor in the probate of the will and while acting in good faith, and it was neither based upon nor related to the carrying into effect of the judgment on appeal.

        Good faith
       
       is necessary for the administrator as well as the executor who seeks to bind the estate for attorney fees. Hudson v. Abercrombie, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 729</cite>, <cite class="app_court">374 S.E.2d 83</cite> (1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       Question of good will turns on the circumstances of each case and former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c03s53-3-23" target="_self">53-3-23</a></cite> did not limit the discretion given the trial court to determine good faith of the propounder of a will who was seeking to recover attorney fees.

        <p>
       Mere fact that a propounder of an earlier will attempts to "defeat" a later will does not prove the propounder did not act in good faith, and lack of good faith is not conclusively proved by the fact that the propounder of an earlier will has a "personal interest" in the will.

       This section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-3-40.
   This section distinguishes two types of wills:
   the wills of testators who die domiciled in any state of the United States other than Georgia or any other territory governed by the laws of the United States ("out-of-state" wills) and the wills of testators who die in another country or territory ("foreign" wills).
   The will of a testator who dies while domiciled outside Georgia is subject to the provisions of this Article only if the testator owned at death located in Georgia or was possessed of a cause of action the venue of which is Georgia.

       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-5-42, which applied only to wills that devised real property located in Georgia. This section uses the term "original probate" to refer to the original probate in Georgia of the will of a nondomiciliary.
   Both foreign wills and out-of-state wills that are valid wills under the laws of the state of Georgia can be admitted to original probate in Georgia.
   Section 53-3-43 (relating to foreign wills that bequeathed personalty) is repealed.

       - Although a foreign will, which has been admitted to probate in the state where the testator lived at the time of death, may be probated in this state by the "production of an exemplification of the probate proceedings", the probate of a foreign will in Georgia is a nullity as respects real estate in Georgia where the will is attested by only two witnesses, and not by three witnesses as required by the former laws of Georgia. Gibson v. Gaines, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 458</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 782</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       <p>
        <p>
       Administrator with the will annexed of a foreign will attested to by only two witnesses and not three as required by Georgia law, which has been probated in Georgia could not, by virtue of such probate, administer on real estate in Georgia and, where the administrator probated such foreign will in a court of ordinary (now probate court) in Georgia, in the manner as required by law, and at the same time made application for leave to sell, for the purpose of paying debts, real estate located in Georgia, it was a valid objection to such order of sale interposed by an heir at law of the testator that the probate of the will in Georgia was a nullity because it was not executed in accordance with the former laws of Georgia. Gibson v. Gaines, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 458</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 782</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - Mere ownership of realty in a certain county would not confer jurisdiction upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) of such county to probate an alleged will, unless the decedent died a nonresident of this state, since the probate of a will must be made in the county of the residence of the alleged testator if a resident of this state; and, if not a resident of this state, the will may be probated in any county where real estate belonging to the testator is situated. Hungerford v. Spalding, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 2</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

        When a nonresident intestate left assets in two counties of this state,
       
       administration can be granted in either, and the ordinary (now probate judge) first commencing the exercise of jurisdiction will retain jurisdiction. Crawley v.

       - Although a foreign will, which has been admitted to probate in the state where the testator lived at the time of death, may be probated in this state by the "production of an exemplification of the probate proceedings", the probate of a foreign will in Georgia is a nullity as respects real estate in Georgia where the will is attested by only two witnesses, and not by three witnesses as required by the former laws of Georgia. Gibson v. Gaines, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 458</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 782</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       <p>
        <p>
       Administrator with the will annexed of a foreign will attested to by only two witnesses and not three as required by Georgia law, which has been probated in Georgia could not, by virtue of such probate, administer on real estate in Georgia and, where the administrator probated such foreign will in a court of ordinary (now probate court) in Georgia, in the manner as required by law, and at the same time made application for leave to sell, for the purpose of paying debts, real estate located in Georgia, it was a valid objection to such order of sale interposed by an heir at law of the testator that the probate of the will in Georgia was a nullity because it was not executed in accordance with the former laws of Georgia. Gibson v. Gaines, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 458</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 782</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

         Ownership of realty and residency necessary for jurisdiction by county probate court.

        <p>
       - Mere ownership of realty in a certain county would not confer jurisdiction upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) of such county to probate an alleged will, unless the decedent died a nonresident of this state, since the probate of a will must be made in the county of the residence of the alleged testator if a resident of this state; and, if not a resident of this state, the will may be probated in any county where real estate belonging to the testator is situated. Hungerford v. Spalding, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 2</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-702).

       <p>
        <p>

        When a nonresident intestate left assets in two counties of this state,
       
       administration can be granted in either, and the ordinary (now probate judge) first commencing the exercise of jurisdiction will retain jurisdiction. Crawley v. Selby, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 530</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 775</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,

       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-3-41, 53-3-46 (which dealt only with wills that bequeathed personal property), and 53-3-48 (which dealt only with wills probated in a foreign country).
   Subsection (a), a new section, provides for the ancillary probate in Georgia of a will that has been validly probated or established in another jurisdiction and that has not been offered for probate and successfully caveated in Georgia.
   Subsection (b) carries forward former OCGA Secs. 53-3-41 and 53-3-46.
   Under this section and Code Section 24-7-24, the judicial proceedings by which out-of-state wills have been admitted to probate in the domiciliary jurisdiction shall be given the same full faith and credit as they have in the domiciliary jurisdiction. Subsection (c) expands the provisions of former OCGA Sec. 53-3-48, which applied only to wills that bequeathed personal property.

       - When a will bequeathing realty and personalty was executed according to the law of the state where the testator resided, and was duly probated in that state, it may be treated in this state as a valid bequest of such personalty, although the will was not attested by as many as three witnesses as required by the law of Georgia, accordingly a court did not err in admitting in evidence a certified copy of a New York will, it appearing that the only property claimed by the plaintiff under such will consisted of notes secured by deeds to real estate in Georgia; and that no interest in the real estate itself was claimed thereunder.

       This section describes who may serve as the executor or administrator with will annexed of an out-of-state will that is probated in Georgia.
   No provisions are included for the appointment of the executor or administrator with will annexed of a foreign will or out-of-state will that is originally probated in Georgia because such wills are subject to the general provisions of Georgia law.
   This section provides specifically that a person must be otherwise qualified to serve as a fiduciary in Georgia (see, e.g., Sec. 53-6-1; Sec. 7-1-242; Part 3 of Article 16 of Chapter 12 of Title 53) in order to be qualified to serve under this section.
   In the case of ancillary probate, ancillary letters testamentary will be issued to the person who qualifies to serve as the executor or administrator with the will annexed.

      Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form.

      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity's principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the state listed as the owner's address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or a similar statute is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section broadens former OCGA Sec. 53-6-22 and 53-6-23 by allowing an individual to serve as the personal representative of a Georgia decedent's estate regardless of whether that individual is a resident of Georgia or a citizen of the United States.

       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-3-4, 53-6-70, and 53-6-71.
   This section requires a person who is named in the will as executor to qualify to serve within 90 days of the date the will is admitted to probate or be deemed to have declined the right to serve.
   If the nominated executor does not qualify within 90 days, the person who is named in the will as the next alternative or successor executor may qualify.
   But if that next nominated executor does not qualify within 90 days, any person named in the will may qualify to serve as executor; if no one applies to do so, the estate is deemed to be unrepresented.
   See Code Sec. 53-6-13, which provides for the appointment of an administrator with will annexed in any case in which a testate estate is or becomes unrepresented.
   This section also provides that the failure to qualify within the specified time period does not automatically preclude the nominated executor from qualifying at a later time.
   See Code Sec. 53-6-12, which provides the same rule in the event a nominated executor voluntarily declines to serve.
   See Code Sec. 53-1-2 for the definitions of "administrator with the will annexed," "executor," and "nominated executor".

       - After a widow renounced her right to serve as executor, but attempted to reinstate herself after the court denied appointment to the widow's choice as administrator, there was no error in the trial court's denial of the motion to substitute the widow as executor or the denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the attempted substitution.

       This section indicates that the procedure for petitioning for letters of administration with the will annexed is the same as the procedure for letters testamentary if the will has not yet been probated.
   If the will has already been probated, the petition for letters of administration with the will annexed need only set forth the facts surrounding the probate of the will and the circumstances that require the appointment of the administrator with the will annexed and need only be served on the beneficiaries of the will.
   See Code Sec. 53-1-2 for the definitions of "administrator with the will annexed" and "beneficiary."
   See Code Secs. 53-11-3 through 53-11-6 for provisions relating to service.

      An administrator may be unanimously selected by all the heirs of a deceased intestate unless the sole heir is the decedent's surviving spouse and an action for divorce or separate maintenance was pending between the deceased intestate and the surviving spouse at the time of death.

       - When there was a divorce pending at the time of decedent's death, the surviving spouse was disqualified to act as administrator but, since the decedent died without lineal heirs, such disqualification did not change the spouse's status as the sole heir; neither decedent's father nor decedent's siblings were "next of kin" interested in the estate as distributees and the father had no standing to challenge the probate court's proper appointment of the county administrator as administrator of the estate.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section replaces subsection (a) of former OCGA Sec. 53-6-26.
   See Code Sec. 53-1-2 for definitions of "administrator" and "personal representative."
   The provisions for an "administrator de bonis non" that appeared in former 53-6-30 are repealed.
   As this section indicates, if an administrator who has already qualified is for some reason unable to serve or continue serving, the person who replaces that administrator will also be referred to as an "administrator".
   The petition for that person's letters need not repeat all the information that appeared in the original petition, but rather need contain only such information as is different from the information in the original petition.

       Subsection (a) of this section replaces portions of former OCGA Secs. 53-6-22 and 53-6-26.
   Subsection (a) requires all personal representatives of intestate estates and temporary administrators to give bond unless otherwise relieved by this Code section.
   Subsection (b) carries forward former OCGA Sec. 53-7-33, which relieves banks and trust companies from giving bond.
   Subsection (c) replaces portions of former OCGA Secs. 53-6-22 and 53-6-26 and allows for the waiver of bond by the unanimous consent of the heirs of an intestate estate.
   This waiver is available only to personal representatives and thus is not available in the case of temporary administrators.
   (As indicated by the definition of "personal representative" that appears in Code Section 53-1-2, a temporary administrator is not included in that category.)
   Subsection (d) provides that this Code section does not override the requirement that County Administrators give bond and those provisions that allow the judge to impose bond where cause for such is shown.

       This section consolidates the provisions of former OCGA Sec. 53-6-1(b) and Secs. 53-6-140 through -146.
   Subsection (a) of this Code section mirrors the provisions for compensation of trustees set forth in OCGA Sec. 53-12-173 and repeals the requirement of former Sec. 53-6-1(b) that the compensation not exceed the legal rate unless the personal representative has a regular, published schedule of fees.
   This subsection also clarifies that a testator may specify compensation in the will, that any individual may enter into an agreement as to compensation prior to death, and that beneficiaries or heirs may enter into an agreement after the death of the decedent. Subsection (b) provides for the specific commissions and compensation allowed under the former law.

      <p>
       This section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-6-150.
   This section gives the probate court discretion to award extra compensation where reasonable.
   Heirs of an intestate decedent or beneficiaries under the will of a testate decedent are served with the petition for extra compensation and have the right to file any objections.
   The court, after hearing any objections, has the discretion to allow any extra compensation the court deems reasonable.
   The allowance of extra compensation is then conclusive upon all parties in interest to the estate.
   In allowing extra compensation, factors that may be considered include whether the estate administration involved unusually greater time or effort, whether the personal representative had responsibilities with respect to assets that were not subject to the jurisdiction of the probate court, whether the estate involved significant tax issues, whether the personal representative also performed legal services for the estate, and whether the personal representative continued or liquidated a business enterprise of the estate. Subsection (c) clarifies that greater compensation may be requested even in those cases in which an amount is specified in the will, unless that amount is equal to the statutory fee that is described in Code Sec. 53-6-60.

       - Estate distribution plan providing for $50,000 in extra compensation to the estate administrator was upheld as the challenging sibling did not show that the payment varied the terms of the will, which was not in the record, and the administrator was permitted to petition the probate court for such additional compensation. After hearing any objections, the probate court allowed such extra compensation as the court deemed reasonable in consideration of the years of contentious litigation that was involved.

       The duties and powers of the personal representative commence upon qualification. Such powers relate back to give acts performed by the personal representative prior to qualification that are beneficial to the estate the same effect as those acts performed after qualification. The personal representative may ratify and accept on behalf of the estate acts that are done by others that would have been proper acts for the personal representative. A personal representative is a fiduciary who, in addition to the specific duties imposed by law, is under a general duty to settle the estate as expeditiously and with as little sacrifice of value as is reasonable under all of the circumstances. The personal representative shall use the authority and powers conferred by law, by the terms of any will under which the personal representative is acting, by any order of court in proceedings to which the personal representative is a party, and by the rules generally applicable to fiduciaries to act in the best interests of all persons who are interested in the estate and with due regard for their respective rights.

       As part of the petition for letters testamentary or letters of administration or by separate petition, the beneficiaries of a testate estate or the heirs of an intestate estate may, by unanimous consent, authorize but not require the probate court to grant to the personal representative any of the powers contained in Code Section 53-12-261. With respect to any beneficiary or heir who is not sui juris, the consent may be given by the guardian. The personal representative of a deceased beneficiary or heir shall be authorized to consent on behalf of that beneficiary or heir. The grant of powers shall only be ordered after publication of a citation and without any objection being filed. The citation shall be sufficient if it states generally that the petition requests that powers contained in Code Section 53-12-261 be granted.

      <p>
       Subsection (a) had no counterpart in former OCGA Title 53. This subsection gives broad direction to the personal representative to pursue those acts necessary for an expeditious administration of the estate.
   Subsection (b) carries forward the provisions of former OCGA Sec. 53-6-26(b), allowing the beneficiaries of a testate estate or the heirs of an intestate estate to authorize the probate court to grant the fiduciary powers that are delineated for trustees in OCGA Sec. 53-12-232.
   This subsection modifies former law by allowing a guardian ad litem to consent on behalf of a beneficiary or heir who is not sui juris.
   (Former OCGA Sec. 53-6-26(b) did not include a guardian ad litem in the list of those who would consent on behalf of an individual who is not sui juris.)
   (For general provisions relating to guardians, see OCGA Sec. 53-11-2.)
   The subsection also allows the personal representative of a deceased beneficiary or heir to consent for that individual.
   See Code Sec. 53-1-2 for definitions of "beneficiary," "heir," and "personal representative".

       - Probate court order removing an executor from an estate and ordering the executor to forfeit $79,000 in commissions and fees received and costs incurred as executor and attorney for the estate was upheld on appeal because: (1) the record showed that the attorney filed a purported estate accounting six inches thick, which was prepared by the staff and which the attorney showed little familiarity with; (2) the attorney delayed a distribution to a beneficiary by trying to force the beneficiary to create a trust, which was not required by the decedent's will; (3) the attorney filed an erroneous tax return that had to be amended as well as took a deduction the attorney knew was improper; and (4) the attorney incurred unnecessary expenses and fees by showing the decedent's house when the sale of the house was not required by the will.

         Executor's breach of fiduciary duty.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In circumstances in which an estate executor used a power of attorney before the executor's mother's death to add the executor's name to bank accounts and a certificate of deposit, eventually taking all of the money from those accounts for the executor's own without reporting that money as part of the estate, a probate court was authorized to order the executor to turn over that money to the estate; after the executor was appointed to handle the estate, the executor knew that the executor possessed money that should have been in the estate, knowledge the executor gained by being the person who removed it from the estate, and the executor's retention of those funds promoted the executor's own interest to injury of beneficiaries of the estate, and thus was a breach of the executor's fiduciary duty. Greenway v. Hamilton, <cite class="ga_court">280 Ga. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">631 S.E.2d 689</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Probate court order removing an executor for cause was affirmed because the executor violated the executor's fiduciary duty in numerous ways by failing to dissolve the estate business, using estate property and funds for the executor's own benefit and to pay personal bills, overpaying executor's fees, and having a conflict of interest by continuing to operate the business despite the estate losing money but personally benefiting by using the business property rent free. Myers v. Myers, <cite class="ga_court">297 Ga. 490</cite>, <cite class="app_court">775 S.E.2d 145</cite> (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the parties entered into a High-Low settlement agreement that was silent as to how the funds should be allocated between the wrongful death claim and the claims of the decedent's estate, the decedent's wife, who was also the administrator of the decedent's estate, acted in contravention of the wife's fiduciary duties to the children by arguing that none of the settlement funds should be allocated to the wrongful death claim, and the trial court erred by failing to allocate any of the settlement funds to the wrongful death claim because the trial court was not allowed to consider the decedent's wishes in apportioning the claims as the children had an absolute right to share in any recovery on that claim.

       - In a purchaser's quiet title action against the executor of a testator's estate, the trial court did not err in adopting the report of a special master and in decreeing that fee simple title to the land was vested in the purchaser because it was the clear intent of the testator to give to the testator's nephew a limited fee to the property based on the contingency that the nephew live on the property, and if the nephew did not, the property was to revert to the estate; the executor was obligated to give effect to the clear intent of the testator to convey only a limited fee to the nephew, and upon a nonoccurrence of the contingency stated in the will, the property automatically reverted to the estate, and the administrator's deed from the executor to the nephew referenced the testator's will and perfected the limited estate.

      <p>
       Subsections (a) and (b) replace former OCGA Secs. 53-7-5 and 53-7-6 and change the law by requiring that personal representatives act unanimously unless the personal representative is acting under a will that indicates otherwise.
   These subsections are modeled after two sections of Title 53 dealing with the actions of cotrustees: OCGA Secs. 53-12-172 and 53-12-196.
   Because it conflicts with this new requirement of unanimous action, former OCGA Sec. 53-2-110 is repealed.
   Subsection (c) carries forward former OCGA Sec. 53-6-2.

   Paragraph (3) also includes an authorization for the personal representative to fulfill the decedent's contracts and bond as to real property, as is contemplated by OCGA Sec. 53-7-96.
   Paragraph (5) modifies the rule of former OCGA Sec. 53-7-11 by allowing the personal representative to continue the decedent's business for twelve months (rather than "until the expiration of the current year" as provided in the former law) and then petition the probate court for permission to continue further upon conditions set up by the probate court (rather than having to petition from year to year, as required by the old law).
   New paragraph (6) allows the personal representative to petition the court to perform acts other than those enumerated in the Code section.
   For general provisions regarding the filing and hearing of petitions in the probate court and notice, see Chapter 11.

       This section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-7-75.
   The new law extends the inventory requirement to cover all property of the decedent whereas the former law limited the requirement as to real property to that real property that is located within the county and any other real property lying outside the county that has come to the knowledge of the personal representative.
   The new law requires the inventory to be filed within six months rather than four months of qualification not only with the probate court but also with the beneficiaries of a testate estate or the heirs of an intestate estate.
   (For provisions relating to the relief or waiver of the right to receive the inventory, see OCGA Sec. 53-7-32.)
   The new law requires that the inventory be verified.
   (For general provisions as to verification of petitions filed in the probate court, see OCGA Sec. 53-11-8).
   The new law requires a supplemental inventory when additional property comes into the personal representative's hands.
   Former OCGA Secs. 53-7-70 through 53-7-74, relating to appraisements, are repealed.

        Administrator may explain any mistake or error in the inventory,

If not a true inventory and appraisal, the burden is upon the removed administrator to prove that it is not correct, and account to the ordinary (now probate judge) for the items which the administrator listed and submitted to the appraisers, and which the administrator verified as correct.

      A testator may, by will, dispense with the necessity of the personal representative's making an inventory to the probate court or the beneficiaries or both, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or persons other than beneficiaries under the will. If a will was executed in another state and the will is valid in this state and under the laws of the state where the will was executed the personal representative would not have been required to file inventories or if the will otherwise expresses an intent to relieve the personal representative from all reporting requirements, such a will shall be construed as dispensing with the necessity of inventories in Georgia, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or parties other than beneficiaries under the will. In all wills, regardless of the date of execution, relief from making inventory with the court shall also relieve the personal representative from sending a copy of the inventory to the beneficiaries.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-7-90 and 53-7-91. Most of the language of OCGA Sec. 53-7-90 is not reflected in this new Code section as similar provisions appear in Code Sec. 53-4-63, relating to abatement.
   The order of priority of claims is changed from the former law in the following ways: funeral expenses are in a category that is separate from and superior to the expenses of the decedent's last illness; expenses relating to the last illness now fall in the category immediately below the expenses of administration; debts due the state or the United States and judgments, mortgages, and liens are retained as priorities but other claims described specifically in former OCGA Sec. 53-7-91(5), (7), (8), and (9) are subsumed into a final category of "all other claims."

       - Though at common law, the administrator might select among creditors of equal degree, and one of them might get a priority over the others by getting a judgment, under this statute, debts have their dignity fixed at the death of the intestate. The administrator has no right to pay one creditor of equal dignity to the detriment of another, nor can one creditor, in case of a deficiency of assets, get the preference of another by getting a prior judgment. Green v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">45 Ga. 205</cite> (1872) (decided under former Code 1868,
   §
   2494).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Priority of debts against an estate is controlled by this statute and no preference among those within a designated priority may be given by an administrator or executor. Cannon v.

       <p>
        <p>

        When an administrator pays debts of an inferior rank,
       
       the administrator's liability may be enforced only in favor of a creditor having a superior claim and injured by the making of such payment. Gwinn v. Trotter, <cite class="ga_court">112 Ga. 703</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E. 49</cite> (1901) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

        Former Code 1933,
       
       §
       
        113-1010 affected property rights and must be strictly construed,
       
       and under such a construction it does not amend former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1508 except as to the particular therein stated and provided for, which is to make a year's support for the family of a deceased person inferior to the lien or claim of a vendor for the purchase money of land.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Priorities of creditors are fixed at the time of the death of the intestate, and this status of creditors cannot be changed by any action of an individual creditor, but each is entitled to the payment of each claim against the estate according to its priority as fixed at the time of the intestate's death. Auld v. Schmelz, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 42</cite>, <cite class="app_court">39 S.E.2d 39</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In the lifetime of the decedent, judgments are ranked according to seniority. But after death the rendition of a judgment against an administrator would not confer any priority on the claim which formed its basis, or changed its rank. Cannon v. Tant, <cite class="ga_court">229 Ga. 771</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E.2d 15</cite> (1972) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <b>
         Debts and legacies stand on precisely the same footing
        </b>
        in regard to priority and one can no more be diminished by the payment of commissions than the other. The expenses of administration, among which are the commissions of the representative, must first be paid whether enough be left to satisfy debts and legacies, or not. Alston v. United States, 228 F. Supp. 216 (N.D. Ga. 1964), aff'd; 349 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1965) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Creditor cannot get a preferred lien on the assets of an estate
       
       as against other creditors of equal degree by getting the first judgment against the administrator. Auld v. Schmelz, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 42</cite>, <cite class="app_court">39 S.E.2d 39</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - To permit a judgment creditor to proceed to collect a judgment by garnishment, during the time permitted by law for the executor to marshal the assets of the estate and determine the claims against the estate, would be to vitiate the priority set forth in this statute. Professional Disct. Corp. v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 424</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E.2d 80</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Judgment based on a verdict against an executor,
       
       in a suit for specific performance brought originally against the testator, under a prayer for damages in lieu of specific performance, on the ground that the defendant was not in a position to specifically perform an agreement, is based on an unliquidated demand within the meaning of this statute governing priority in the payment of claims against the estate of a decedent. Benfield v. McMillan, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 52</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 600</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Although the trustee had not lost or dissipated by mismanagement the fund which the trustee held in a fiduciary capacity as guardian, and although in allowing this fund to remain on deposit, until the trustee's death, in a bank and while it was a solvent institution, the trustee may have exercised the care required of the trustee as a fiduciary, the trustee's estate, after the trustee's death, nevertheless, became liable to the owner or beneficiary of the fund in accordance with the priorities established by law for the payment of the debts of a decedent.

       Since there is a presumption of law that executors act legally rather than illegally and do the things that they should do rather than those that they should not do, an assent by an executor to a legacy, in derogation of the rights of creditors, will not be presumed or implied, in the absence of plain and unequivocal facts upon which such an implied assent is based. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 907</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

        An assent once given to a devise is irrevocable
       
       as a general rule and perfects the inchoate title to the property in the devisee, if the assets of the estate may prove insufficient to pay the debts, in which case the remedy of an unpaid creditor is, generally, not to have the devised land subjected to a sale under an order of the ordinary (now probate judge), or under a judgment against the executor, but to follow the property into the hands of the devisee and there subject it at law or equity to the payment of the claim.

        Check may in a proper action be used as evidence
       
       in support of the payee's claim of indebtedness against the decedent but not as evidence of the indebtedness itself; and when the check was merely a gift or otherwise without consideration, the payee would have no valid claim against the estate.

       Being a mere order to pay which has been revoked by the death of the drawer, a check in the hands of the original payee does not constitute a debt under this statute for which the decedent's estate would be liable so as to authorize a suit on the check itself; but the payee "is remitted to any underlying claim he may have against the decedent."

       - Former Code 1933,
   §§
   113-1002 and 113-1508 providing for a year's support and fixing its priority are to be construed liberally in favor of the dependents. Olmstead v. Clark, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 513</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1508).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Statute manifests clearly a fixed legislative intent
       
       that, wherever brought into competition with each other, a year's support must have priority over a previous judgment against the deceased. Farmers Fertilizer Co. v. J.R. Watkins Co., <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 49</cite>, <cite class="app_court">33 S.E.2d 294</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1508).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A year's support ranks first
       
       among the claims against an estate, standing ahead of funeral expenses and all other general debts. McLean v. McLean, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 751</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 707</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1508).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        As provided by statute the year's support, when allowed,
       
       is to be preferred before all other debts against the estate, including burial expenses and expenses of the last illness. Livingston v. Langley, <cite class="ga_court">79 Ga. 169</cite>, <cite class="app_court">3 S.E. 909</cite> (1887) (decided under former Code 1882,
   §
   2533); Aiken v. Davidson, <cite class="ga_court">146 Ga. 252</cite>, <cite class="app_court">91 S.E. 34</cite> (1916);(decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Support for the family ranks first
       
       against the estate of a decedent. It is ahead of taxes. It is ahead of liens, judgments, and mortgages. It is likewise ahead of debts due by the deceased, as trustee. House v. House, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 678</cite>, <cite class="app_court">13 S.E.2d 817</cite> (1941) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1508).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Year's support for the family of the deceased
       
       has first claim on the deceased's property. In order for the relinquishment of a widow's right to claim a year's support to be binding on her, it must be made with knowledge of her rights and of the condition of the estate. Hubbard v. Hubbard, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 617</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 862</cite> (1963) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1508).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Year's support is on the same footing as expenses of administration,
       
       and is not subject to the law of distribution of estates or to debts against an estate, or liens against the property, except when it is made so by law. Tomlinson v. City of Adel, <cite class="ga_court">169 Ga. 758</cite>, <cite class="app_court">151 S.E. 482</cite> (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Year's support is superior to liens
       
       created by the decedent, or liens arising by operation of law during the decedent's ownership, except for purchase money. Tomlinson v. City of Adel, <cite class="ga_court">169 Ga. 758</cite>, <cite class="app_court">151 S.E. 482</cite> (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - When the purchaser of land under a bond for title or other executory contract of sale agrees therein to pay the purchase money thereof and the taxes thereon, and the purchaser is put in possession of the land, and the equitable interest of the purchaser is set apart as a year's support to his widow and minor children, the widow would have to pay off the purchase-money debt, including the taxes which accrued on the property, before she would be entitled to enjoy such equitable interest against the claim of the state and county for taxes due on the land. Beaton v. Ware County, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 798</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 672</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        Year's support does not supersede a bill of sale
       
       passing title to the property to secure debt, executed by the deceased and duly recorded in the deceased's lifetime. Philpot v. Ramsey &amp; Hogan, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 635</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 204</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Widow's right to a year's support in personal property is not superior to the right of a creditor of the deceased in the property where it has been conveyed to him by the deceased under a bill of sale to secure debt, although the bill of sale was never recorded.

       When a factor occupied, as to the landlord, the position of a bona fide acquisitor of a mortgage lien on the property, for value and without notice, and, so far as was there held, possessed only a lien upon the property for the advancements made, such lien, when no title passed, had no priority over the lien given by statute on the property of the deceased at the time of his death to the widow and minor children for a year's support. Philpot v. Ramsey &amp; Hogan, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 635</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 204</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When, after the death of the grantor in three security deeds, the equity of redemption was set apart to his widow and minor child, and thereafter the property was sold at public sale under an execution in favor of the first security-deed holder who announced that all liens against the property would be settled from the proceeds, and all lienholders and claimants were made parties to and asserted their liens against the fund produced at such sale in a suit to determine the order of distribution, after the payment of the costs of sale the year's support claim was entitled to the full amount of the equity of redemption. Tax claims which had attached to the property before the setting apart of the year's support were entitled to preference over the security-deed holders to the extent that the tax claims were in excess of the portion of the taxes that could and should have been paid from the equity of redemption in the absence of a year's support, and the security-deed holders were entitled to the full amount of their secured debt, less the taxes in excess of the equity.

       In a case where a widow has made application for year's support, the appraisers have filed their return, and citation has been published, and a creditor of the deceased husband appears at the proper time and place for the purpose of filing objections on appropriate grounds, and upon agreement of counsel that if objections are not filed the creditor's claim may, by judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) on the return, be placed in superior rank by reducing the estate awarded the widow, under principles of estoppel pleaded against her she may not thereafter in an equitable proceeding question the validity of such judgment.

       - When a grantee takes title to real property conveyed by a deed upon consideration that the grantee will furnish a home to the grantor and her husband as long as they live, and the grantee dies, with the grantor and her husband surviving, and the grantee has until the grantee's death performed the obligation so cast upon the grantee, but the grantee's estate is insolvent, the grantee's widow may claim the property conveyed as a year's support, as against the effort of the grantor to have the conveyance rescinded in equity.

       - Although a judgment for year's support would have ranked ahead of payment of debts, the mere fact that plaintiffs by relationship occupied a position which would entitle them to apply for and obtain such a judgment, would not entitle them, without having it allowed in the only way provided by law, to have a recovery against the administrator and the administrator's surety. A year's support to be enforceable must be manifest in a judgment. It is not in existence as such until such judgment. Howard v.

       - Year's support is not superior to the claim of a creditor of the decedent, who holds title to the land as vendor thereof under an executory contract of sale, or under a deed to secure debt.

       - While it is true that, except as to conveyances of title to secure debt, a year's support is superior to liens created by a decedent, or liens arising by operation of law during his ownership, and the widow thus takes the interest of the decedent stripped of all such inferior claims, the title of the widow to the property set apart as a year's support is not superior to liens which had already adhered against the property before the decedent husband acquired it. Paulk v. City of Ocilla, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 69</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E.2d 642</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the record establishes that although the husband died several years before the assessments were made, his estate was still in process of administration, and the lots were still held by his executors for the purpose of administration, at the time the liens arose, and that the application for year's support was not filed until after the assessments had thus been made against the property as a part of the estate of the decedent; in these circumstances, the assessments and executions would constitute "claims against the estate". The year's support was therefore entitled to priority, insofar as accrual of the liens after the husband's death is concerned. Johnson v.

       - When the decedent husband, under a foreclosure of his security deed, acquired title to the property subsequently set apart to his widow as a year's support, after the lien of a paving assessment had attached thereto, her title was subordinate to such lien of the city, and the court did not err in so holding.

       - In a dispute between two siblings and their brother's widow, arising out of the brother's purchase and mortgage of a home for a fourth sibling, the title of which was in the names of the two siblings and the brother, the trial court erred in ruling that the siblings were not entitled to cancellation or satisfaction of the loan documents after the widow paid the amounts due on the mortgage because the estate had a duty to pay the amount due as the brother was the only obligor on the mortgage.

      The personal representative shall be allowed six months from the date of the qualification of the first personal representative to serve in which to ascertain the condition of the estate. Every personal representative shall, within 60 days from the date of qualification, publish a notice directed generally to all of the creditors of the estate to render an account of their demands. The notice shall be published once a week for four weeks in the official newspaper of the county in which the personal representative qualified. Creditors who fail to give notice of claims within three months from the date of publication of the personal representative's last notice shall lose all rights to an equal participation with creditors of equal priority to whom distribution is made before notice of such claims is brought to the personal representative, and they may not hold the personal representative liable for a misappropriation of the funds. If, however, there are assets in the hands of the personal representative sufficient to pay such debts and if no claims of greater priority are unpaid, the assets shall be thus appropriated notwithstanding failure to give notice.

       This section carries forward former OCGA Sec. 53-7-92.
   The use of the word "personal representative" in the first sentence indicates that the six-month term does not begin to run if a temporary administrator is appointed.
   See Code Sec. 53-1-2 for the definitions of "personal representative" and "temporary administrator".

       - In general, when an order is given for the publication of a notice of a limitation of the time to file claims, and such notice is duly published, claims not filed within the time specified in the notice are precluded in that proceeding from sharing in the assets. This result is held to follow, however, only when there has been, in the meantime, a final distribution of the funds in the hands of the receiver, based upon claims proven, unless injustice would otherwise be done.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When bond has been given by an administrator in the usual course of administration proceedings, as required by statute, the ordinary remedy of a creditor of the estate, after failure by the administrator to pay the obligation in due course, and after compliance by the creditor with preliminary statutory procedure, is a suit upon the bond. Such a suit against the administrator and the securities on the bond usually affording an adequate remedy at law, it is generally unnecessary to resort to equity for the collection or protection of the claim.

        Plaintiff would not be relieved from liability,
       
       although plaintiff may have given notice to creditors in pursuance of law and the present claim for taxes was not asserted, or brought to the attention of the plaintiff by any taxing official until after distribution, if the plaintiff, as administrator, had knowledge of such tax liability, and the plaintiff distributed the estate at the plaintiff's peril; and it is immaterial that the claim for taxes was not asserted within the time fixed by law after notice by the administrator to creditors, or before such distribution.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) of this section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-7-93.
   The first sentence clarifies that the personal representative is not required to pay any debts of the estate within the first six months of administration of the estate. The use of the word "personal representative" indicates that the six-month period does not begin to run when a temporary administrator is appointed.
   (See Code Sec. 53-1-2 for the definitions of "personal representative" and "temporary administrator".) The final sentence of the former Code section is merged into the second sentence of this subsection.
   Former OCGA Sec. 53-7-94, dealing with the revival of claims barred by the statute of limitations, is repealed.
   Subsection (b) replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-7-102.

       An administrator is not under any duty immediately to sell real property of the intestate after the expiration of the administration year; but, before the real property can be sold, it must distinctly be shown to the ordinary (now probate judge) that it is necessary to sell the land to satisfy one of the conditions referred to by statute.

       An action in trover against an administrator, wherein a recovery for the hire and value of the property involved is expressly waived, and recovery of the property itself is sought, is not covered by this statute, providing that no suit to recover a debt due by the decedent shall be commenced against the administrator until the expiration of 12 (now six) months from the administrator's qualification.

       Statute providing no suit to recover a debt due by the decedent shall be commenced against the administrator until the expiration of six months from the administrator's qualification does not apply to trover action wherein recovery for hire and value of property involved is expressly waived, and recovery of property itself is sought within the six months period.

       Plaintiff, in a proper case, may institute an action of trover against an administrator, if the administrator wrongfully withholds property belonging to the plaintiff, before the expiration of 12 (now six) months. Byrd v. Riggs, <cite class="ga_app_court">87 Ga. App. 7</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E.2d 35</cite> (1952) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       While under this statute no suit to recover a debt due by the decedent shall be commenced against the administrator until the expiration of 12 (now six) months from the administrator's qualification, a suit brought against an administrator for the purpose of canceling deeds made to the intestate is not a suit to recover a debt due by the decedent, and may be brought before the expiration of 12 (now six) months from the qualification of the administrator. Sutton v. McMillan, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 139</cite> (1957) (decided under former Code 1933,

        An action for specific performance

        An assent once given to a devise is irrevocable
       
       as a general rule, and perfects the inchoate title to the property in the devisee, even if the assets of the estate may prove insufficient to pay the debts; in which case the remedy of an unpaid creditor is, generally, not to have the devised land subjected to a sale under an order of the ordinary (now probate judge), or under a judgment against the executor, but to follow the property into the hands of the devisee and there subject it at law or equity to the payment of the devisee's claim. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 907</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1506).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An exception to the general rule
       
       that assent to a devise is irrevocable even if the assets of the estate prove insufficient to pay debts is that an executor is precluded from administering to oneself as against the rights of creditors of whose claims the administrator has notice. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 907</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1506).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Plaintiff, claiming as a devisee under the will of plaintiff's father, was estopped from asserting that the executor of the will had assented to the devise, and from denying that title to the property devised was in subsequently appointed administrators de bonis non cum testamento annexo at the time of their public sale of the realty of the estate, under which the defendant claimed, the basis of such alleged estoppel being that the plaintiff joined in a written request by all four devisees to the ordinary (now probate judge) for the appointment of such administrators, upon their petition setting forth that the will remained unexecuted. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 907</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1506).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Defendant legatees stand in the place of the executor
       
       as regards the establishment of the debt due by the estate. Thus, the action is not governed by the limitations in reference to actions for money had and received or unjust enrichment, but by the limitations to actions on the character of the claim against the estate. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams Hosp. v. Nisbet, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 821</cite>, <cite class="app_court">14 S.E.2d 64</cite> (1941) (decided under former Code 1933,

   113-1506).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Creditor's right is to have the assets of the estate in the hands of the legatee applied
       
       in satisfaction of the debt, if they be sufficient for that purpose. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams Hosp. v. Nisbet, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 821</cite>, <cite class="app_court">14 S.E.2d 64</cite> (1941) (decided under former Code 1933,

      Personal representatives are authorized to compromise, adjust, arbitrate, assign, sue or defend, abandon, or otherwise deal with or settle debts or claims in favor of or against the estate. A personal representative who declines to litigate any claim may assign the claim to a creditor or an heir of an intestate estate or a beneficiary of a testate estate for the purpose of prosecuting the claim at that person's own expense and, after reimbursement of the expenses to the creditor, heir, or beneficiary, any remaining proceeds shall be paid over to the personal representative for administration.

The petition shall state that the personal representative has paid all claims against the estate or shall enumerate which claims of the estate have not been paid and the reason for such nonpayment.

Any heir or beneficiary or creditor who is a minor at the time of the discharge and who is not represented by a guardian may, within two years of reaching the age of majority, commence suit against the personal representative and such discharge shall be no bar to the action.

       If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative discharged, the probate court, upon petition of any interested person and upon such notice as it directs, may appoint the same personal representative or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently discovered estate. If a new appointment is made, unless the probate court orders otherwise, the provisions of this title shall apply as appropriate; but no claim previously barred may be asserted in the subsequent administration.

       This section combines and replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-7-140, 53-7-141, 53-7-143 and 53-7-145.
   Under this section, a discharge may be granted without a hearing if no interested party files an objection to the discharge.
   The petition for discharge must contain a list of any known claims against the estate that the personal representative has not paid.
   The creditors of these claims shall be given notice and the opportunity to file objections to the discharge.
   Subsection (e) is modeled after Uniform Probate Code Sec. 3-1008.

        Administrator may not petition for discharge until
       
       the administrator has fully discharged all the administrator's duties, which includes the duty of distribution. Fuller v. Fuller, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 429</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 520</cite> (1963) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Judgment of a probate court discharging an executor will relieve the executor
       
       from all liability on account of the executor's administration, unless it be impeached or set aside in some appropriate manner. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

       - Until an executor is properly discharged or otherwise relieved by law, an executor retains the authority of that appointment and the obligations of that fiduciary relationship with those the executor represents. Liner v. North, <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 677</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 846</cite> (1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Probate court's order that discharged the administrator was vacated because a party in interest could file an objection to a petition for discharge and was entitled to a hearing thereon. Here, the administrator neither listed the creditor with a disputed claim, nor did the administrator serve the creditor with notice of the administrator's petition for discharge.

       - Judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging administrators may be impeached in that court for irregularity, or in the superior court for fraud. Morris v. Johnstone, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E. 308</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>
       Judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging an administrator will relieve the administrator from all liability on account of the administrator's administration unless it be impeached or set aside in some appropriate manner. Clair v. Burke, <cite class="ga_app_court">62 Ga. App. 607</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 119</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Court did not err in sustaining general demurrer and dismissing petition seeking to hold defendant liable for money which defendant had deposited in a bank while acting as administrator since the judgment by the court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging defendant as administrator had not been attacked. Clair v. Burke, <cite class="ga_app_court">62 Ga. App. 607</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 119</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Judgment of discharge may be set aside for fraud.

       - While the statute seemingly refers to a motion in the court of ordinary (now probate court) which granted the discharge, the action can be sustained under the general rule that a judgment may be set aside for fraud in a court of equity; a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) being no exception to this rule. White v. Roper, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 180</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 177</cite> (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4091).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Provisions of this statute do not alter the cardinal rule
       
       that a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, and regular upon the judgment's face, is to be deemed conclusive until the judgment is duly set aside, either on motion in the court in which the judgment was rendered, or in an equitable proceeding instituted in the superior court. Stanton v. Gailey, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">33 S.E.2d 747</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging the administrator is open to attack on the ground that the judgment was fraudulently procured, the judgment is to be deemed "void" only when, in a proceeding to set it aside, the proof shows the judgment was secured by practicing a fraud upon the heirs at law or upon the ordinary. Stanton v. Gailey, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">33 S.E.2d 747</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging an administrator, which has been fraudulently obtained by falsely representing to the ordinary (now probate judge) that the applicant has fully discharged the applicant's duties as administrator, can be set aside by a proper proceeding for that purpose, instituted in the court rendering it; and this remedy is open to creditors as well as to heirs. Mullis v. Bank of Chauncey, <cite class="ga_app_court">40 Ga. App. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E. 471</cite> (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       <p>
        <p>
       Though the discharge of an executor obtained by actual fraud practiced on the heirs or the ordinary (now probate judge) may be set aside on motion and proof of the fraud, the beneficiaries sui juris under the will must institute their action to set aside the discharge within three years from the date of the order discharging the executor. Warnock v. Warnock, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 548</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 571</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Petition seeking to set aside a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging an executor, brought 13 years after such discharge, which did not contain specific allegations of actual fraud on the part of the executor deterring and debarring the plaintiffs from sooner instituting the action so as to toll the statute of limitations, was subject to dismissal on general demurrer. Warnock v. Warnock, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 548</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 571</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Probate court properly revoked letters testamentary, ordered reimbursement to a decedent's estate of excessive expenses, and ordered a settling of the estate's accounts when the decedent's executor committed 17 breaches of fiduciary duty, including failing to wind up the estate and failing to provide the decedent's other child with an accounting. Fowler v. Cox, <cite class="ga_app_court">264 Ga. App. 880</cite>, <cite class="app_court">592 S.E.2d 510</cite> (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a probate court's order removing an executor; the relevant question in reviewing a removal order regarding an executor is whether the trial court had grounds to conclude that there was good cause for the removal. In re Estate of Arnsdorff, <cite class="ga_app_court">273 Ga. App. 612</cite>, <cite class="app_court">615 S.E.2d 758</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Probate court order removing an executor from an estate and ordering the attorney to forfeit $79,000 in commissions and fees received and costs incurred as executor and attorney for the estate was upheld on appeal because: (1) the record showed that the attorney filed a purported estate accounting six inches thick, which was prepared by the staff and which the attorney showed little familiarity with; (2) the attorney delayed a distribution to a beneficiary by trying to force the beneficiary to create a trust, which was not required by the decedent's will; (3) the attorney filed an erroneous tax return that had to be amended as well as took a deduction the attorney knew was improper; and (4) the attorney incurred unnecessary expenses and fees by showing the decedent's house when the sale of the house was not required by the will. In re Estate of Arnsdorff, <cite class="ga_app_court">273 Ga. App. 612</cite>, <cite class="app_court">615 S.E.2d 758</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because an executor ignored a testator's intent and the directions contained in the testator's will, and consciously failed to seek direction from the courts despite the executor's admitted knowledge that the executor should do so, the trial court properly found that the executor violated the executor's fiduciary duties and forfeited the executor's right to compensation in O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Personal representative's wrongful conveyance of the estate's primary asset, a house, to the personal representative was a breach of fiduciary duty. The beneficiary's evidence of the house's rental value authorized the award to the beneficiary of compensatory damages for lost rent under O.C.G.A.

        An administrator cannot be allowed to violate the public law
       
       of the state in the management of the estate entrusted to the administrator, and then be heard to say that such violation of the law was for the benefit of that estate, when called on to show cause why the administrator's letters of administration should not be revoked.

       - When it appears that, under a previous adjudication of this court, the administrator is entitled to hold and manage the estate, without accounting to the legatee under a will, until the happening of a certain contingency, which the petition reveals has not occurred, an accounting and final settlement would be premature in the absence of a removal of the administrator.

      </h4>

       <p>

       An allegation of insolvency of the executor
      
      is a substantial factor for consideration when there are specific allegations showing danger of loss to persons interested in the estate, but an allegation of insolvency, standing alone, is insufficient to authorize a court of equity to interfere in the administration of an estate. The ordinary (now probate judge) has ample authority to investigate charges that an executor is mismanaging an estate, and to require the executor to give bond or to remove the person as executor. Gaines v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 668</cite>, <cite class="app_court">119 S.E.2d 28</cite> (1961) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       While failure to make returns as required by law
      
      may be cause for removing an executor, it is not a compulsory ground for so doing, but one within the discretion of the court. Holsenbeck v. Arnold, <cite class="ga_app_court">75 Ga. App. 311</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E.2d 348</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Failure of an executor or guardian to make returns is an omission of duty, and therefore a breach of trust, and throws on the executor or guardian the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the court and jury that the executor or guardian has discharged the duty of the trust with fidelity. Holsenbeck v. Arnold, <cite class="ga_app_court">75 Ga. App. 311</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E.2d 348</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       In a proceeding by a legatee against an executor for an accounting,
      
      before the ordinary (now probate judge) under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201, the ordinary (or the superior court on appeal) is authorized to remove such executor when it appears that the executor has without authority used property in the executor's hands, in a joint venture or partnership in which the executor in the executor's individual right is interested, and when, without authority, the executor is shown to have held as speculation property or crops which it was the executor's duty under the law to sell. This is true, even though such venture or speculation does not result in loss to the beneficiary, the law being that as to such a trust this relationship must not be assumed and no such risk be taken, unless authorized by the will. Perdue v. McKenzie, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 356</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 705</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Probate court order removing an executor for cause was affirmed because the executor violated the executor's fiduciary duty in numerous ways by failing to dissolve the estate business, using estate property and funds for the executor's own benefit and to pay personal bills, overpaying executor's fees, and having a conflict of interest by continuing to operate the business despite the estate losing money but personally benefiting by using the business property rent free.

       - Statute does not require an ordinary (now probate judge), or a jury in the judge's stead to remove the administrator when, though admittedly there were certain violations of the law, no loss is claimed to have resulted to the estate, and when no accounting is sought.

         Suit on bond of administrator as remedy for fraud.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the heirs allege that the administrator of the estate is guilty of fraud and collusion with respect to the sale of property, and that a receiver should be appointed to reclaim and resell the property, but the heirs do not want to prevent the ultimate sale of the property, the question is merely one of damage resulting from an alleged breach of duty by the administrator. In this case, the administrator's bond as administrator would furnish an adequate remedy to the heirs, since they could not possibly be in such danger of loss or injury as to require either a receivership or an injunction for the protection of their interests. Conner v. Yawn, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 500</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 541</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When, in a suit against an administrator and another for the appointment of a receiver and other equitable relief, it appears from the pleadings and evidence that the heirs of an estate may obtain adequate protection and redress in the court of ordinary (now probate court) as to each complaint against an administrator in reference to the estate of the intestate, the heirs do not present a proper case for the appointment of a receiver for such estate or for injunction since a suit on the administrator's bond is an adequate remedy at law. Conner v. Yawn, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 500</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 541</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        If a bond is not sufficient to protect any interested party,
       
       the ordinary (now probate judge) has authority, upon proper application, to increase the bond, revoke the letters of administration, or pass such other order as may in the party's judgment be expedient under the circumstances of the case. Furr v. Jordan, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 862</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 861</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - While, as provided in law after the administrator has been appointed and has taken charge of the estate, upon proof that the administrator wastes or in any manner mismanages the estate or for any reason the administrator is unfit for the trust reposed in the administrator, the ordinary (now probate judge) may in the ordinary's discretion revoke the letters of administration. The widow, who is legally entitled to the administration, cannot, when she is of sound mind, be denied the appointment upon the mere speculation that she will, on account of lack of business experience and want of capacity to manage the particular estate, mismanage the estate and prove unfit for the trust reposed.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When an executor destroys or attempts to destroy evidence in the executor's possession that would help prove an arguably valid claim against the estate, the probate court does not abuse the court's discretion in removing the executor, particularly when, as here, the executor is the residual beneficiary under the will and thus stands to personally profit from defeat of the claim. In re Estate of Davis, <cite class="ga_app_court">243 Ga. App. 58</cite>, <cite class="app_court">532 S.E.2d 169</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Probate court properly revoked letters testamentary, ordered reimbursement to a decedent's estate of excessive expenses, and ordered a settling of the estate's accounts when the decedent's executor committed 17 breaches of fiduciary duty, including failing to wind up the estate and failing to provide the decedent's other child with an accounting. Fowler v. Cox, <cite class="ga_app_court">264 Ga. App. 880</cite>, <cite class="app_court">592 S.E.2d 510</cite> (2003).

        <p>
       As the question of the legitimacy of the administrator's transactions was properly before the court, the probate court did not err in addressing it or in granting the relief necessary to protect the estate.

        <p>
       - Trial court erred in removing an executor of an estate based on the executor's failure to appear at a hearing concerning a will beneficiary's request for information; there was no evidence that the executor was on notice that executor's letters testamentary could be revoked for failing to attend the hearing as required by O.C.G.A.

       - Under this statute, the discretion of the ordinary (now probate judge), or a jury acting in the ordinary's stead on appeal to the superior court, is very broad and may be exercised whether the violation of law under consideration is a minor or major "matter," and the court may not in either event withdraw that discretion. Lokey v. Lokey, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 569</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Court may not lawfully tell a jury that they have no right to remove an administrator who is guilty of mismanagement which does not result in any injury to the estate. To do so would be to invade the province of the jury by withdrawing the jury's discretion. Lokey v. Lokey, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga.

       Because removal of an executor was within the jury's discretion but was not mandated, the trial court properly denied the petitioner's motions for directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. following a special verdict finding that the executor should not be removed.

        Statute furnishes the necessary guidance
       
       for the exercise of the ordinary's (now probate judge) or jury's discretion as to remedial measures to be adopted against a negligent or derelict administrator upon consideration of the evidence upon the hearing. An ordinary (now probate judge) or a jury in the ordinary's stead has broad discretion in the premises, and the law does not require an administrator's removal, even if guilty of mismanagement or misconduct, as the only remedial measure. The jury may in the jury's discretion do something else. Lokey v. Lokey, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 569</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229).

       <p>
        <p>

        Revoking letters of administration
       
       is an action that a jury may take or not take in the jury's discretion, and this discretion will not be controlled unless abused. Lokey v. Lokey, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 569</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When an administrator has been guilty of a violation of the law in the management of an estate, but the administrator's act has not resulted in any loss to the estate, the jury could still remove the administrator. Lokey v. Lokey, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 569</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Even if the jury found some derelictions of the administrator to be "minor matters" the jury might regard them as presaging more serious infractions, and having found such violations of the law might, in their discretion, remove the administrator. Lokey v. Lokey, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 569</cite> (1950) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the findings and conclusions of the probate court established that a former spouse's marital status was not correctly stated in the former spouse's application for letters of administration, and that this incorrect information was a material factor in the issuance of those letters, it was not an abuse of discretion to remove the spouse as administrator of the deceased's estate.

       - Trial court did not err in dismissing purported beneficiary's complaint alleging that executors breached the fiduciary duties owed to the beneficiary
   by wasting the assets of the parents' estates and failing to distribute assets to the beneficiary because the claims would be more properly heard by the probate court which had original and exclusive jurisdiction over such matters; the probate court was equipped to handle such claims and had the authority to grant the relief requested, if necessary.

       - When decedent's 89-year-old parent did not comprehend the duties and responsibilities of an executor and may have been acting in a manner detrimental to the estate, the probate court acted within the court's discretion in removing the parent as coexecutor.

       - On appeal to the superior court after a finding adverse to the petitioner on the issue of the administrator's unfitness by the ordinary (now probate judge), the trial in the superior court is had without reference to the evidence introduced in the former trial, and in such a case the discretion exercised by the ordinary (now probate judge) is transferred to the jury in the superior court. Wofford v. Vandiver, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,

       While former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1101 made the provisions of former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1229 applicable to executors, and by the provisions of
   §
   113-1229, an executor may be removed or required to give additional security - in the exercise of sound discretion by the ordinary (now probate judge) - when it is shown that the ordinary is guilty of waste or mismanagement or that the ordinary is insolvent or, for any reason, the ordinary is unfit for the trust, yet despite this power courts are reluctant to exercise the power when no strong case therefor is shown. And the discretion vested by the statute in the ordinary (now probate judge) is to be exercised by the jury or judge acting as jury on appeal to the superior court. Patterson v.

        <p>
       - For a failure to make "returns as required by law," or for insufficient security, the administrator may be cited in the court of ordinary (now probate court) and the court of ordinary (now probate judge) is vested with full power to revoke the letters of administration, or to pass such order as may be necessary for the protection of interested parties. Hoffman v. Chester, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 296</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 760</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A proceeding for the revocation of letters of administration or letters testamentary may be initiated "whenever the ordinary (now probate judge) knows, or is informed by any person having any interest in the estate," that one or more of the specified conditions exist which will authorize the ordinary (now probate judge) in the ordinary's discretion to revoke the letters; an attorney may convey such information to the ordinary and initiate by a petition the proceeding, resulting in an order of revocation of the letters testamentary by the ordinary (now probate judge), and in an affirmance of such order by the superior court on appeal, even though the attorney may not be a beneficiary under the will or a creditor of the estate, but is merely interested therein on account of a claim for attorney's fees in connection with the probate of the will. Bruce v. Fogarty, <cite class="ga_app_court">53 Ga. App. 443</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 463</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - It is necessary for the probate court to address any material unresolved factual issues including the question of whether an executor has breached a settlement agreement; since the beneficiary under the will is not seeking to enforce the agreement, but instead to determine whether the executor has breached the agreement, the superior court should not have jurisdiction. Gray v. McKenna, <cite class="ga_app_court">202 Ga. App. 685</cite>, <cite class="app_court">415 S.E.2d 295</cite> (1992) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the testator in a will appoints a person to be the executor only so long as the executor remains a widow, and the executor remarries after qualification as the executor, the court of ordinary (now probate court) has jurisdiction of a petition to revoke the court's letters testamentary on the ground that the executor is no longer qualified under the will. Bruce v. Fogarty, <cite class="ga_app_court">53 Ga. App. 443</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 463</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Jurisdiction of the court of ordinary (now probate court) to revoke the letters of executorship,
       
       and to require the executor to make an accounting and settlement to the heirs, is limited to the case as one at law. Goodman v. Little, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 178</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 567</cite> (1957) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Probate court did not lack jurisdiction to disqualify a wife as the executor of her husband's will probated in common form. Even though it was termed a caveat, the daughter's petition did not challenge the will's validity, but rather merely challenged the wife's ability to serve as executor, which was permitted under O.C.G.A.

        When an administrator desires to resign a trust
       
       from any cause, the administrator shall petition the ordinary (now probate judge), setting forth the administrator's reasons and the name of a suitable person qualified and entitled to serve in the administrator's place, and citation shall issue requiring the next of kin to show cause why the resignation should not become effective and the new administrator appointed. Davis v. Melton, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 685</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 300</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Original executor cannot name an executor of the estate represented by the original executor;
       
       but when the original executor executes a will and therein names an executor for one's own estate, the latter ipso facto becomes a successor executor of the original estate. Gormley v. Watson, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 763</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 280</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2306 considered in conjunction with former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1101 required that an executor desiring to resign the executor's trust give notice of this fact to the next of kin of the testator. Gormley v. Watson, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 763</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 280</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       Nearest of next of kin are entitled to notice of proceedings for the resignation of administrators and guardians where they reside in the state. Bivins v. Middlebrooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 570</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Publication of the application and citation is necessary
       
       in order for the resignation to become effective and valid. Davis v. Melton, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 685</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 300</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        Next of kin of a testate
       
       are entitled to the same notice as the next of kin of an intestate; and the next of kin who are also legatees under the will are entitled to the formal written notice of the resignation of an executor and the appointment of the executor's successor.

        - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4075, former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2203, and former O.C.G.A.

        Statute does not appear to be of legislative origin,
       
       but seems to have been placed in the Code by the first codifiers, and retained in each subsequent Code. It was not meant to announce any new principle; for the English courts of equity had long exercised such a jurisdiction, and the American courts, with certain limitations and restrictions, have generally recognized the same rule. Jones v. Head, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 857</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 725</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       §
       
        113-2203,
       
       which declared that a court of equity shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) over the settlement of accounts of administrators. Manry v.

        <p>
       - A court of equity is distinctly and in terms declared to have jurisdiction over the settlement of accounts of administrators, and a court of equity having jurisdiction for that purpose may go on and give full relief in the premises. Calbeck v. Herrington, <cite class="ga_court">169 Ga. 869</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E. 53</cite> (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       <p>
        <p>
       It by no means follows that because a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) over the settlement of accounts of administrators, it will act in every case involving that subject matter. Jones v. Head, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 857</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 725</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Courts of equity and courts of ordinary (now probate courts) have concurrent jurisdiction over the matter of accounting as against an administrator or executor, and a suit in equity for accounting may be filed, notwithstanding the fact that the court of ordinary (now probate court) may require an accounting, so long as no actual proceedings for an accounting have been instituted in the court of ordinary (now probate court). Morris v. Nicholson, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 786</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Applicability to executors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Principle that a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction over the settlement of accounts of administrators is made applicable to executors. Powell v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 737</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E. 341</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2203).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An executor is entitled to the direction of the courts
       
       of Georgia and to the aid of equity in the settlement of the executor's accounts in the performance of the executor's duties and the fulfillment of the executor's oath if a proper case for equity is alleged. Georgia Money Corp. v. Rissman, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 476</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 486</cite> (1964) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2203).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a legatee under a will brings an equitable proceeding to compel an executor to settle with the executor and to turn over to the legacies or devises coming to the executor under the will, a court of equity has jurisdiction to require the executor to give bond in a proper case. Powell v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 737</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E. 341</cite> (1934) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2203).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Proceeding by the heirs at law for an accounting may be maintained jointly
       
       against the administrator in the administrator's official capacity and as an individual. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 343</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2203).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Proceeding brought for accounting with an administrator
       
       is not predicated upon any debt or claim against the administrator or the estate; the heirs at law are not creditors of either, but the owners of the property of the deceased, subject to the rules of administration of estates. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 343</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2203).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Application may be made to a court of equity
       
       by a party interested in the estate, before application for the appointment of an administrator, or the filing of a will and a petition that it be probated. But the concurrent jurisdiction of equity is not confined to this. Howard v. Boone, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 156</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E. 462</cite> (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4075).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Equity will not interfere with the regular administration of estates
       
       at the instance of an heir except when there is danger of loss or other injury to the heir's interest. Gill v. Gill, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 567</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E.2d 389</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2203).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Courts of equity are loath to interfere
       
       in the administration of estates; but having concurrent jurisdiction with the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the settlement of accounts, the court's will not hesitate to interfere for the full protection of the rights of parties in interest. Hamrick v. Prewett, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 895</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E. 678</cite> (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4075).

       - Proceeding brought against an administrator or executor and for a settlement by an heir at law or legatee is not such interference with the regular administration of estates as is denounced by law. The jurisdiction of a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a court of equity in respect to bringing proceedings for an account and settlement is co-ordinate and equal, and has always been so in this state. The jurisdiction conferred upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the management and distribution of estates does not oust the jurisdiction of equity in matters of settlement. Terry v.

       Even after administration has begun, and whenever it is made to appear that the conditions in the administration of the estate and the rights of all persons interested in the estate's administration can be more effectually preserved or promoted by the intervention of equity, the subject-matter of administration may be assumed by a court of equity.

       Though a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a court of equity are declared to have concurrent jurisdiction, it is a general rule that the court first taking will retain jurisdiction, unless the intervention of equity is necessary to afford relief in aid of the administration of the estate by the court of ordinary (now probate court); but the intervention of equity which seeks merely to oust the jurisdiction already acquired by the ordinary (now probate judge) cannot be used as a substitute for the appeal from the court of ordinary (now probate judge) to the superior court, which is provided by law, or to relieve from the results of failure to file proper caveats to an application for letters testamentary and the probate of a will in solemn form, unless it appears from the petition in equity that the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) was procured by fraud on the part of an adversary, unmixed with negligence upon the part of the petitioner.

       - Whatever may be the remedies that have been provided by statute against administrators, the concurrent jurisdiction of equity in the settlement of accounts of administrators is specially retained by the provisions of this statute.

       If an insolvent executor in charge of real estate which includes houses which need repairs, no matter however small, and the executor, being without sufficient funds to make them, fails to do so, and on this account the property is deteriorating, the persons to whom the property has been devised are entitled to have the property protected, and the appointment of a receiver with directions to the receiver to have the repairs made seems not to be an inappropriate remedy. Jones v. Proctor, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 607</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 779</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When devisee brings equitable petition against coexecutors of an estate, seeking a partition of the property of the estate through a sale by the receiver, and alleging that more than 20 years had elapsed since the executors had qualified, that all the debts of the estate had been paid, and that executors were in possession of all real and personal property belonging to the estate, the allegations are insufficient to authorize the grant of the prayers for equitable partition between the devisees because plaintiff devisee has a full and adequate remedy under the law in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to require executors to distribute the estate by division or partition.

       Though a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) over the settlement of accounts of executors, it will not assume jurisdiction solely for that purpose unless it be shown that the remedies available in the court of ordinary (now probate court) are inadequate to afford complete relief to the party claiming to be aggrieved.

       - Since an administrator de bonis non is necessarily a successor to an administrator or executor whose authority has expired by death, removal, or otherwise, this statute gives to the administrator de bonis non the right to an accounting only from executors and administrators who have been removed. Ballard v. Zachry, <cite class="ga_app_court">54 Ga. App. 101</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E. 139</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

       An executor of a deceased executor's estate, which allegedly possesses assets of the estate of the decedent which were acquired by the deceased executor in the executor's capacity as executor of the decedent's estate, is an officer of the court of ordinary (now probate court) and subject to account to the administrator de bonis non with will annexed of the decedent's estate. Estes v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 653</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E.2d 449</cite> (1967) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Court of ordinary (now probate court) is without jurisdiction

        Probate of the will worked a revocation

        Administrator de bonis non of an estate

       When the pleadings showed that the administratrix de bonis non of an estate was also the administrator of the estate of the deceased administrator who was alleged to have committed the devastavit, and when the pleadings showed that the administrator had acted in both capacities since the year 1915, and that up to the filing of the plaintiff heirs' suit in 1930 the administrator made no returns nor brought any action for such alleged devastavit, it was not necessary for the plaintiff in this case to make the specific allegation that the administratrix de bonis non had failed to sue in order to bring suit in plaintiff's own right; and there was no duty resting on the heir to have an administratrix de bonis non appointed who was qualified.

       <p class="p4">
        - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1873,
   §
   2599, former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4073, and former Code 1933,
   §§
   113-2201 and 113-2202, are included in the annotations for this Code section.

         Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Statute does not restrict and confine the remedy of an accounting merely as against the administrator individually or as administrator; the statute's purpose is to require an accounting of the property of the estate that went into the administrator's hands, and could be maintained whether brought against one as administrator, or jointly as administrator and as an individual. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 343</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Statute gives the right to a legatee
       
       to cite the administrator to appear before the ordinary (now probate judge) for a settlement of accounts. Cubine v. Cubine, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 656</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 462</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        If the statute should be construed as not embracing an assignee,
       
       this would merely constitute an additional ground for proceeding in equity, and would not defeat such assignee altogether. Sanders v. Hepp, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 18</cite>, <cite class="app_court">8 S.E.2d 87</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Sounder and better construction of this statute,
       
       touching the enforcement of judgments rendered by the ordinary (now probate judge) against executors and administrators on citations to account, is that mere money liabilities, when no specific fund is involved, are enforceable only by execution against the property, and not by attachment against the person. Paschal v. Melton, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 910</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E. 757</cite> (1932) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2202).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Proceeding brought for accounting with an administrator
       
       is not predicated upon any debt or claim against the administrator or the estate; the heirs at law are not creditors of either, but the owners of the property of the deceased, subject to the rules of administration of estates. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 343</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Mere qualification and the filing of annual returns
       
       by an executor in the court of ordinary (now probate court) do not constitute a proceeding for a "settlement of his accounts," with judgment enforcing the settlement, as provided by former Code 1933,
   §§
   2201 and 2202, and would not preclude the superior court from taking jurisdiction of a subsequent petition by a residuary legatee for an accounting and settlement against the executor. Robinson v. Georgia Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 395</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Heirs at law may bring their suit
       
       for their distributive shares against an administrator and the sureties on the administrator's bond, and pray for an accounting and settlement, at any time after the expiration of one year from the time of the qualification of such administrator. No prior judgment establishing the liability of the administrator or a devastavit by the administrator shall be necessary before suit against the sureties on the bond. Langford v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 444</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 779</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   4073).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        One distributee or legatee may proceed for an accounting
       
       and settlement without joining other distributees or legatees as parties, and the representative of the estate is not required, unless one so desires for one's own protection, to make other distributees or legatees parties to the proceeding. Robinson v. Georgia Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 395</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201); Bracewell v. Bracewell, <cite class="ga_app_court">117 Ga. App. 553</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E.2d 390</cite> (1968);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Proceeding by the heirs at law for an accounting may be maintained jointly
       
       against the administrator in the administrator's official capacity and as an individual. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 343</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When an administrator is cited for settlement before the court of ordinary (now probate court), and one issue involved is whether certain certificates of deposit in a bank are the property of the estate and should be administered, the ordinary (now probate judge), in making settlement of the account between the administrator and the distributees, has jurisdiction to pass upon such issue, and the administrator's decision therein becomes res judicata as to all distributees who are present at the hearing. Brooks v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 872</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 893</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Agreement between administrators and heirs
       
       touching sale of lands and conveyance thereof to certain of the heirs did not constitute a final settlement of the estate. Musselwhite v. Ricks, <cite class="ga_app_court">55 Ga. App. 58</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 597</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Claim of deceased heir asserted by personal representative.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In action against an administrator for an accounting, the heirs at law of a deceased heir at law cannot maintain a suit as such for the portion due the deceased heir at law, as any interest of the deceased heir at law must be asserted by a personal representative; but the failure to join, as a party plaintiff, the personal representative of a deceased heir at law would not authorize the dismissal of the suit. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 343</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When an executor also held a life estate in property, the executor's broad power as life tenant was not determinative of the executor's liability for an accounting of the estate in her capacity as executor, in the face of the remainderman's claims of fraud and mismanagement. Cannon v. Bangs, <cite class="ga_court">269 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">502 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1998).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the minor is a "person interested as distributee or legatee" who might, under the terms of this statute, cite the executor "to appear before the ordinary (now probate judge) for settlement of his accounts," which, when had, would be conclusive upon the executor, ordinarily, this right in the minor, where the minor has a legal guardian, should be maintained by the minor's guardian, or by next friend or other competent representative; and such a citation would be binding on the minor. Perdue v. McKenzie, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 356</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 705</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-2201).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the guardian, acting on behalf of the minor by reason of the disqualification of the trustee who might otherwise have acted as testamentary guardian, seeks a settlement of the accounts with the executor, such proceeding is properly maintained. Perdue v. McKenzie, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 356</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 705</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In circumstances in which an estate executor used a power of attorney before the executor's mother's death to add the executor's name to bank accounts and a certificate of deposit, eventually taking all of the money from those accounts for the executor's own without reporting that money as part of the estate, a probate court was authorized to order the executor to turn over that money to the estate; after the executor was appointed to handle the estate, the executor knew that the executor possessed money that should have been in the estate, knowledge the executor gained by being the person who removed the money from the estate, and the executor's retention of those funds promoted the executor's own interest to injury of beneficiaries of the estate, and thus was a breach of the executor's fiduciary duty. Greenway v. Hamilton, <cite class="ga_court">280 Ga. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">631 S.E.2d 689</cite> (2006).

       - When issues remained pending in the probate court, no final accounting or settlement of accounts was possible; thus, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c07s53-7-62" target="_self">53-7-62</a></cite> did not authorize an appeal. Geeslin v. Sheftall, <cite class="ga_app_court">263 Ga. App. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">589 S.E.2d 601</cite> (2003).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Because an administrator was personally served with a copy of the removal petition and the "citation and rule nisi," and never raised any objection to the alleged procedural defect in the answer or during the hearing, the administrator's claim that the probate court erred in ordering an accounting during the removal proceeding because the administrator was not served with a citation to appear before the court for a settlement of accounts, as required by O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c07s53-7-63" target="_self">53-7-63</a></cite>, was meritless; hence, the probate court's order was not void. Ray v. Nat'l Health Investors, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">280 Ga. App. 44</cite>, <cite class="app_court">633 S.E.2d 388</cite> (2006).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the probate court found that an executor kept an estate open without legitimate reason, disregarded court orders, breached the executor's fiduciary duty to the estate, and unnecessarily expanded the proceedings once a petition for accounting had been filed, such that an award of attorney fees to the petitioner was warranted under O.C.G.A.

       In a proceeding by a legatee against an executor, before the ordinary (now probate court) under this statute, for an accounting, the ordinary (or the superior court on appeal) is authorized to remove such executor when it appears that the executor has without authority used property in the executor's hands, in a joint venture or partnership in which the executor in one's individual right is interested, and where, without authority, the executor is shown to have held as a speculation property or crops which it was the executor's duty under the law to sell. This is true even though such venture or speculation does not result in loss to the beneficiary, the law being that as to such a trust this relationship must not be assumed and no such risk be taken, unless authorized by the will.

       - While a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) in settlement of accounts of guardians (or administrators), the jurisdiction of the ordinary (now probate judge) is original and the court of equity concurrent. In settling accounts of the representative of an estate, the representative's returns which have been allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge) are considered as stated accounts, and the rule that any one who objects to a stated account must surcharge and falsify applies. The object of settling the accounts of the representative of an estate is to determine whether or not the representative has properly administered the trust. Trust Co. v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">54 Ga. App. 518</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 469</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Estate distribution plan providing for $50,000 in extra compensation to the estate administrator was upheld as the challenging sibling did not show that the payment varied the terms of the will, which was not in the record, and the administrator was permitted to petition the probate court for such additional compensation. After hearing any objections, the probate court allowed such extra compensation as the court deemed reasonable in consideration of the years of contentious litigation that was involved.

        Sounder and better construction of this statute,
       
       touching the enforcement of judgments rendered by the ordinary (now probate judge) against executors and administrators on citations to account, is that mere money liabilities, when no specific fund is involved, are enforceable only by execution against the property, and not by attachment against the person.

       - Provision that the ordinary (now probate judge) may "hear evidence upon any contested question, and settle finally between the distributee and administrator" means that in the hearing of such citation it is within the power of the court of ordinary (now probate court) to decide any presented question which it is necessary for the court to decide in order to determine whether the administrator has discharged all his duties with respect to the assets of the estate, and consequently how the administrator's account should be settled with the distributees.

       - There was evidence and legal authority to support the probate court's ruling that retirement funds belonged to the decedent's son because the son was named as beneficiary, and the funds did not pass into the decedent's estate because the executor testified that the executor concluded that the retirement funds were not an estate asset so the executor did not attempt to collect the funds from the son; resolution of the issue of the retirement proceeds in the context of a petition for settlement of accounts under O.C.G.A.

        Statute provides in part for the basis for an accounting,
       
       and must be considered in the light of other sections of the Code concerning the duties of administrators and the penalties for failure to perform such duties. The object of the proceeding is to require of the administrator a full accounting concerning the discharge of the administrator's trust in a detailed statement of the administrator's actings and doings, and a settlement with the administrator's successor; and the paying of any portion of the estate which by evidence may be found to be due by the former administrator to the administrator's successor.

        Law fixes the duties of the administrator
       
       as to the disposal of the funds of the estate, and the administrator's failure to conform thereto by keeping the money not needed for current expenses and in failing to invest the money as provided by law deprives the beneficiary of the use thereof. Accordingly, for this breach of duty and in order to protect the beneficiary from loss of income, the law requires that the administrator pay interest on funds so held. Thomas v.

        Within 60 days of the anniversary of the date of qualification, in each year, every personal representative required by the laws of this state to make annual returns shall file with the probate court a true and just verified accounting of the receipts and expenditures in behalf of the estate during the year preceding the anniversary date of qualification, together with a note or memorandum of any other fact necessary to the exhibition of the true condition of the estate. The return shall include an updated inventory of the assets of the estate as of the anniversary date of qualification. With this return, either the original vouchers shall be filed, showing the correctness of each item, or, in lieu thereof, the personal representative shall attach an affidavit stating that the original vouchers have been compared to each item on the return and that the return is correct; but the probate court shall require the original vouchers to be produced for good cause shown.

       - There was no abuse of discretion in the probate court's removal of an administrator based on findings that the administrator failed to file timely and proper annual returns. In re Estate of Jackson, <cite class="ga_app_court">241 Ga. App. 392</cite>, <cite class="app_court">526 S.E.2d 884</cite> (1999).

        <p>

        Annual returns which do not substantially comply
       
       with the law are not prima facie proof in favor of the administrator. If they are allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge) and recorded, under the terms of the statute, anyone challenging their correctness must carry the burden of proving their incorrectness. But when the returns are not allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge), the burden is upon the administrator to prove the returns' correctness in a proceeding in the court of ordinary (now probate court) for an accounting and settlement.

       This new section requires the personal representative to mail a copy of the annual return to the heirs of an intestate estate or the beneficiaries of a testate estate.
   This section also provides that the heirs or beneficiaries may individually waive the right to receive the inventory or, by unanimous consent, relieve the personal representative of the duty to file the annual returns.
   Code Sec. 53-7-1(b)
   describes ways in which the consent of individuals who are not sui juris or who are dead may be given.
   Under Code Sec. 53-7-1(b), the heirs or beneficiaries may authorize the grant [of] some or all of the powers contained in Code Sec. 53-12-232.
   Code Sec. 53-12-232(31) allows the fiduciary to serve without making returns.
   Therefore, it is possible that the heirs or beneficiaries will either relieve the personal representative of the duty to make returns under subsection (b) this Code section or simply by authorizing the grant of all the powers contained in Code Sec. 53-12-232, in the manner described in Code Sec. 53-7-1(b).

     <p>
      A testator may, by will, dispense with the necessity of the personal representative's filing an annual return with the probate court or the beneficiaries or both, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or persons other than beneficiaries under the will. If a will was executed in another state and the will is valid in this state and under the laws of the state where the will was executed the personal representative would not have been required to file annual returns or if the will otherwise expresses an intent to relieve the personal representative from all reporting requirements, such a will shall be construed as dispensing with the necessity of annual returns in Georgia, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or parties other than beneficiaries under the will. In all wills, regardless of the date of execution, relief from filing returns with the court shall also relieve the personal representative from sending a copy of the return to the beneficiaries.

        Mere failure to attach vouchers to returns,
       
       standing alone, would not constitute a fraud upon the court of ordinary (now probate court). The total failure to file any returns at all would not, within itself, constitute fraud, nor afford a good reason for the interference of equity. While under the law it is the duty of an administrator to file annual returns accompanied by original vouchers, the duty is placed upon the ordinary (now probate court) to examine the returns to determine their correctness and interested parties are given 30 days in which to file objections to the returns.

      To ensure annual returns from every personal representative, it shall be the duty of the probate court to keep a docket of all those who are liable to make returns and, immediately after the ceasing of the January term or as soon thereafter as the court deems practical in each year, to cite all defaulters to show cause for their neglect.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-8-1 through 53-8-3.
   (Former Sec. 53-8-4, which contained the effective date for these sections, is repealed as unnecessary.)
   The provisions of this Code section apply to all personal representatives, while the provision of the former Code section applied only to executors.
   Subsection (a) provides a "safe harbor" for personal representatives who invest in the authorized investments that are listed in the next two Code sections. For all other investments, personal representatives must adhere to the prudence standard described in the remaining provisions of this section.
   This prudence standard appeared as former OCGA Sec. 53-8-2(b) prior to the amendment of that statute in 1988.
   The standard for investing that appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-8-2(b) and (c), as amended in 1988, has been retained for trustees and now appears Article 13 of Chapter 12 of this Title. Former OCGA Sec. 53-8-2(d), relating to income beneficiaries of trusts that qualify for the federal estate tax marital deduction, has also been moved to that section of the Georgia Trust Act.
   Subsection (b) of the new section appeared as subsection (a) of former OCGA Sec. 53-8-2. Subsection (c) of the new section carries forward former OCGA Sec. 53-8-3(b).
   Subsection (d) of the new section carries former OCGA Sec. 53-2-8(e).

       - In the absence of evidence that the administrator or guardian first obtained an order from the judge of the superior court authorizing the investment, the administrator or guardian is liable to the heirs of the estate for the money belonging to the estate which the administrator has invested in real estate, notwithstanding that the administrator or guardian acted in good faith and with the approval of the ordinary (now probate judge) and that the minors received the benefit of the investment as a home.

       Unless otherwise provided in the will, a personal representative is authorized to retain the property received by the personal representative on the creation of the estate, including, in the case of a corporate fiduciary, stock or other securities of its own issue, even though the property may not otherwise be a legal investment and a personal representative shall not be liable for such retention, except for gross neglect.

       - In a purchaser's quiet title action against the executor of a testator's estate, the trial court did not err in adopting the report of a special master and in decreeing that fee simple title to the land was vested in the purchaser because it was the clear intent of the testator to give to the testator's nephew a limited fee to the property based on the contingency that the nephew live on the property, and if the nephew did not, the property was to revert to the estate; the executor was obligated to give effect to the clear intent of the testator to convey only a limited fee to the nephew, and upon a nonoccurrence of the contingency stated in the will, the property automatically reverted to the estate, and the administrator's deed from the executor to the nephew referenced the testator's will and perfected the limited estate.

      <p>
       This section replaces former OCGA Secs. 53-8-20, 53-8-22 through 53-8-36, and 53-8-38 through 53-8-47 with streamlined procedures for the sale of estate property.
   Subsection (d) carries forward former OCGA Sec. 53-8-49.
   Subsection (e) carries forward the provisions of former OCGA Sec. 53-8-50. Subsection (f) replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-8-51 with a provision that allows but does not require the divesting of liens on real property sold under the provisions of this Code section.
   Former OCGA Secs. 53-8-70 through 53-8-73, dealing with claims to property proposed to be sold, are repealed. Former Code Sections 53-8-20, 53-8-22, 53-8-38 and 53-8-47 now appear in Article 2 of Title 29 (Guardian and Ward).

       Statute provides that if in a sale by an administrator there be irregularities, or the administrator fails to comply with the law as to the mode of the sale, the sale is voidable except as to innocent purchasers. This statute applies also to sales by guardians, but it protects innocent purchasers against nothing except irregularities in carrying out a valid order. And the first part of the statute provides that "to divest the title of the heir at law, the administrator must have authority to sell." Powell v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 197</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 745</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Statute permits "wild uncultivated lands lying in counties
       
       other than that of the administration" to be disposed of at private sale; but the order authorizing such sale must be after notice. Powell v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 197</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 745</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Cultivated land in the adverse possession of any one
       
       would not be wild land, and could not be sold as such under this statute. Downing Lumber Co. v. Medlin &amp; Sundy, <cite class="ga_court">136 Ga. 665</cite>, <cite class="app_court">72 S.E. 22</cite> (1911) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - Object of this statute is to prevent the administrator from sacrificing the value of the property by putting the property up for sale under such circumstances that the purchaser would buy a lawsuit along with the land. The law deems it more expedient that the administrator should first end the lawsuit personally, and then sell for full value. Downing Lumber Co. v.

       - It is the duty of an administrator to sell the property of the administrator's intestate for an adequate price, and to withdraw it from sale when it becomes apparent to the administrator that it is about to be sacrificed for want of a bid commensurate with its true market value.

        Law presumes there are debts to be paid,
       
       in absence of anything to contrary; and in order for a purchaser to be affected by a fraudulent exercise of a power of sale granted by a will, as when a sale is made for the purported purpose of paying debts when a sale for that purpose is not necessary, either participation in the fraud or notice of it by the purchaser would have to appear; therefore, when a sale is advertised and made as being necessary to pay debts, the presumption referred to is not overcome, as to an innocent purchaser, by the circumstance that the sale occurred about five years after the death of the testator.

       - An administrator not only has a right to withdraw an intestate's property from sale, but it is the administrator's legal duty to do so when it becomes apparent to the administrator that it is about to be sacrificed for want of a bid commensurate with its true market value, since nothing can be tolerated which comes into conflict or competition with the interest or welfare of those interested in the estate. Hall v. White, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 144</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 516</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the property involved was, at the time of the property's sale, reasonably worth $2,000.00, and the intestate's administrator sold the property to his wife for $600.00, knowing at the time that her bid was for an amount far less than its fair and reasonable market value, it was the legal duty of the administrator to have withdrawn the property from sale and not to have knocked it off to his wife - the highest bidder. Hall v. White, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 144</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 516</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the administrator and the administrator's wife, while property was being exposed for sale, requested various persons attending the sale as prospective purchasers not to bid on the property, the intestate's property was not exposed for sale under circumstances to command the best price obtainable. Hall v. White, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 144</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 516</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

        As a general rule, an administrator cannot bid at an administrator's sale of property
       
       belonging to an intestate's estate, and this rule applies to the administrator's wife just as it does to the administrator. Wallace v. Wallace, <cite class="ga_court">142 Ga. 408</cite>, <cite class="app_court">83 S.E. 113</cite> (1914) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - Upon the death of the realty owner intestate, title vests directly in the heirs, subject to administration for payment of debts and distribution. Administrators can only sell real estate for these purposes after complying with former O.C.G.A.

        When a will contained the following:
       
       "I wish my executor, as soon as possible after my death, to pay all my debts. If a sale of property shall be necessary I wish him to select for sale that which can be most advantageously used for that purpose; and I authorize him to sell the same at public or private sale, as he may see fit," under this provision, no application to the court of ordinary (now probate court) for leave to sell for the purpose of paying debts was necessary in order to exercise the power of sale. Wood v. Bowden, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 329</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 516</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When no authority for private sale of realty
       
       is conferred by will, the executor thereunder is without power to enter into a contract for such sale of the property of the testator's estate; such a contract is violative of public policy, and is unenforceable. Fisher v. Pair, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 492</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 187</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        An administrator is not under any duty immediately to sell real property
       
       of the administrator's intestate after the expiration of the administration year; but, before the real property can be sold, it must distinctly be shown to the ordinary (now probate judge) that it is necessary to sell the land to satisfy one of the conditions referred to in this statute. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 61</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 776</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It is not an absolute requirement of the law that an administrator shall sell all of the land of the estate at the expiration of the administration year and that the land shall be sold only for the payment of debts or distribution. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 61</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 776</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Allegation that the real property was not sold promptly or at the expiration of the administration year did not show a breach of the bond of the administrators as there is no requirement of the law that an administrator shall sell the real estate promptly after the administrator's qualification, nor does the law require that an administrator sell the real property at the expiration of the year. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 61</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 776</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Infeasibility of division of the land and the necessity of a sale for the purpose of distribution is one of the purposes for which land may be sold by an administrator. Warren v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Allegations to the effect that a sale by the executor should be enjoined because there are in fact no debts of the estate, afford no reason for the grant of an injunction, when the executor obtained from the ordinary (now probate judge) an order permitting the sale for the purpose of paying the indebtedness claimed by the executor to be due. Brewton v. McLeod, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 686</cite>, <cite class="app_court">119 S.E.2d 105</cite> (1961) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       When, after due notice, leave has been regularly granted by the court of ordinary (now probate court) to an administrator to sell realty of a decedent, equity will not restrain the sale by injunction at the instance of an heir on account of reasons which could have been as readily urged in a caveat to the application for leave to sell. Brewton v. McLeod, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 686</cite>, <cite class="app_court">119 S.E.2d 105</cite> (1961) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Under the common law, printed or written particulars and conditions of sale could not be contradicted, added to, or altered by verbal declarations made by the auctioneer at the time of sale, but the Supreme Court is not disposed to apply this common-law rule so strictly as to exclude all parol declarations as to the altered terms of sale from the printed or written advertisements made by executors and administrators at their public sales, under the laws of this state, when the bidder or purchaser has full knowledge of such altered terms, and acts upon those terms.

        When executor is clothed solely with power to sell,
       
       and there is nothing to indicate an intention on the part of the testator to authorize the executor to sell at private sale, then the executor must sell after advertising and at public outcry. When the intention of the testator is in doubt as to the mode of sale, the safe rule is to adhere to the mode of sale prescribed by law. To take the case out of the general rule requiring executors to sell at public sale, the intention of the testator should be plainly and distinctly expressed in the words of the power, or should be found by necessary implication from the language used in conferring such power.

       - Sales by executors, if not otherwise provided by will, must be at public outcry to highest bidder. The purchaser is bound to see that the executor is apparently proceeding under the forms prescribed by law. If power be given in a will to sell land or personal property, this only dispenses with the necessity of an order of the court of ordinary (now probate court), and if the will does not expressly or impliedly provide for a private sale, such sales must be public; otherwise such sales are void.

        Main reason that such sales are made void

       <p>
        <p>
       When the proof submitted is sufficient to establish title in the intestate at the time of death, and there is nothing whatever to indicate that the property is held by an adverse claimant, it will be presumed that possession accompanies title.

        Administrator cannot sell property of an intestate without order of court

       - When the same people are administrators of a wife's estate and executors of the husband's estate, and having obtained from the ordinary (now probate judge) orders to sell the lands belonging to each estate, if the heirs and legatees enter into an agreement that the entire property may be offered and sold together at one time, and the lands belonging to both estates are by the executors and administrators so cried off and sold at public sale, the sale cannot on that ground be afterwards treated as invalid by one who entered into such agreement.

       If it would have been unlawful to sell various tracts of land subject to several different security deeds collectively under a single bid, it should be presumed that the administrator who sold the property, the estate holding the security, complied with the law and sold the tracts separately, until the contrary is shown, and a recital stating that the various tracts were all sold to an individual for a stated sum of money without more would not show that they were not sold separately and at prices aggregating the entire sum stated.

       Sale without any order from the ordinary (now probate judge) is void, and passes no title to the purchaser. Dowling v. Keen, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 394</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 789</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Before heirs are deprived of their right of inheritance, there not only must exist a necessity that the lands be sold by the administrator either to pay debts or to make distribution, the order granting leave to sell being evidence of such necessity, but also that the administrator actually sold the land; it is the sale under the order that divests the title.

       Order by the ordinary's court (now probate court) is in effect not only leave to sell, but is an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that it is necessary for the land to be administered for one or the other or both of the purposes indicated in former Code 1933,
   §§
   113-901 and 113-1706 (i.e., for payment of debts and distribution among the heirs) and that it is for the benefit of the heirs and creditors. Warren v. Warren, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga.

       When the estate consisted of approximately 50 acres with fractional interests as small as 1/280ths vested in great grandchildren of the testator, a division in kind was virtually impossible and the trial court did not err in appointing commissioners and directing a sale.

       - Deeds in which the named grantor was decedent's estate, and which were signed in the name of the estate and of the two executors, were deeds by the executors of the estate in their official capacity and purported to convey properties belonging to the estate, and were not the personal deeds of the individuals designated as executors. Harrison v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 214</cite> (1958) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1713).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It was the rule at common law that neither an executor nor an administrator could bind the estate by warranty of title, and the language of this statute has been applied to administrators and executors equally, the inclusion of the statute doing no more than to limit the liability of the fiduciary in the fiduciary's individual capacity. Smith Realty Co. v. Hubbard, <cite class="ga_app_court">124 Ga. App. 265</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E.2d 506</cite> (1971) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-1713).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Statute does not say that an administrator with the will annexed cannot by administrator's deed convey good and marketable title to real estate owned by the decedent, or that if the administrator did so the administrator would be subject to an action at law because in the sale contract the administrator had in the administrator's representative capacity signed a contract of sale containing a general warranty of title. Smith Realty Co. v. Hubbard, <cite class="ga_app_court">124 Ga. App. 265</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E.2d 506</cite> (1971) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>

        If executor be given power by will to bind estate by warranty deed,
       
       such fact must appear in evidence; otherwise the executor is prevented from making such warranty. Clark v. Whitehead, <cite class="ga_court">47 Ga. 516</cite> (1873) (decided under former Code 1868,

        All property of a testator being assets to pay debts, it may, if necessary, be sold
       
       for that purpose, regardless of any legacy or devise. Wood v. Bowden, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 329</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 516</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Interests of the devisees in the realty is considered subject to the right of the executor to sell the real estate
       
       for the purpose of paying the debts of the estate and the expense of administration, or for the purpose of making distribution to the heirs or for both purposes. Otherwise, the authority to sell given the executor is meaningless. Williams v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Title to property devised by will, and to be divided among a group of persons upon the happening of a particular event, vests in the executors of the will pending the property's sale, for the purpose of paying debts of the testator, or for the purpose of distribution, in the absence of assent by the executors to the legacy. Whatley v. Musselwhite, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 91</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 227</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An executor's assent to devise does not come within the meaning of Ga. L. 1955, p. 731,
       
       §
       
        1 (see O.C.G.A.

       <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c03s53-3-13" target="_self">53-3-13</a></cite>),
       
       which was intended to offer protection to third-party purchasers of property in an estate against claims for year's support, and was not intended to exempt devises and legacies from year's support. Anderson v. Groover, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">247 S.E.2d 851</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   113-801).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Widow's application for year's support is not barred
       
       by executor's deed of assent as to the property conveyed therein by operation of Ga. L. 1955, p. 731,
   §
   1 (see O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c03s53-3-13" target="_self">53-3-13</a></cite>). Anderson v. Groover, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">247 S.E.2d 851</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Assent to a devise is not void merely because it is made within 12 months
       
       after the appointment and qualification of the executor. Walker v. Horton, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 429</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E. 462</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When a petitioner was devised two tracts of land subject to the stipulation that the property not be sold, mortgaged, encumbered, or otherwise disposed of for a period of ten years; and the testator's widow executed a deed of assent which included the alienation restriction adopted from the will, the petitioner's attack on the deed of assent was inappropriate; petitioner's remedy lay in an attack on the enforcement or effect of the provisions of the will from which the petitioner's title was derived. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">260 Ga. 265</cite>, <cite class="app_court">392 S.E.2d 523</cite> (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - Son and coexecutor of mother's will, under which he and his brother, also his coexecutor, each received an undivided one half interest in property, had standing to bring a partition action in spite of his brother's refusal to assent, and partition was proper although the estate was still in probate. Clay v. Clay, <cite class="ga_court">268 Ga. 40</cite>, <cite class="app_court">485 S.E.2d 205</cite> (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        Requirements of this statute were permissive or directory in effect

        Process of probating a will in Georgia is essentially a formal validation
       
       of the property interests which came into existence upon the death of the testator. Jenkins v. United States, 428 F.2d 538 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 59</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Probate is title-accommodating rather than interest-creating. Jenkins v. United States, 428 F.2d 538 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 59</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L.

       <p>
        <p>

        Devisee receives an "inchoate title"
       
       subject to perfection when the executor assents to the devise. Jenkins v. United States, 428 F.2d 538 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 59</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Devisee possessing an "inchoate title" has a genuine beneficial interest
       
       in the property and a right of action against the executor of the estate if the executor has not given the executor's assent to the devise within one year after qualification as executor. Jenkins v. United States, 428 F.2d 538 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 59</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L.

       - Devisee can execute a valid conveyance of the property prior to the assent of the executor; when the executor assents to the devise, the perfected title inures to the benefit of the grantee of the conveyance rather than the devisee-grantor. Jenkins v. United States, 428 F.2d 538 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 59</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L.

       - A legacy is not subject to be seized and sold for the debts of the legatee, until the executor has assented to it; or, at least, until all claims upon it of higher rank than the claim of the legatee have ceased to exist. Suggs v. Sapp, <cite class="ga_court">20 Ga. 100</cite> (1856) (decided under former law). Wilkinson &amp; Wilson v. Chew, <cite class="ga_court">54 Ga. 602</cite> (1875) See also (decided under former law).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An executor's assent to a legacy under former Code 1933,
   §§
   113-801 and 113-802 divested the executor of the title to the property embraced therein and perfects the inchoate title of the legatee so as to give the latter a right of action to recover such property if held adversely to the executor. People's Nat'l Bank v. Cleveland, <cite class="ga_court">117 Ga. 908</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E. 20</cite> (1903) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the assent of the executor is once given to a devise of land, it is generally irrevocable, although the assets of the estate prove insufficient to pay the debts of the estate. Citizens Bank v. Citizens &amp; S. Bank, <cite class="ga_court">160 Ga. 109</cite>, <cite class="app_court">127 S.E. 219</cite> (1925) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       Assent of the executor to the legacy inures to the benefit of the remaindermen and perfects their title. Moore v. Turner, <cite class="ga_court">148 Ga. 77</cite>, <cite class="app_court">95 S.E. 965</cite> (1918) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        Until the required assent by the executor, the legal title to the devised realty and bequeathed personalty of the testator is in the executor;

        <p>
       - As a general rule, an assent once given to a devise is irrevocable and perfects the inchoate title to the property in the devisee, if the assets of the estate may prove insufficient to pay the debts, in which case the remedy of an unpaid creditor is, generally, not to have the devised land subjected to a sale under an order of the ordinary (now probate judge), or under a judgment against the executor, but to follow the property into the hands of the devisee and there subject it at law or equity to the payment of the claim. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 907</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When after an assent to a devise the property is levied on to satisfy a judgment against the devisee, the legal representative cannot reclaim the property merely because the devisee is indebted to the estate, or there are debts against the estate, pending the settlement of which assent could have been withheld. Whatever may be the remedy of creditors of the estate or other devisees in such case, the assent is binding upon the legal representative so long as it stands; and whether or not it might be revoked for cause such as fraud, accident, or mistake, in the instant case there was nothing to show a revocation, nor was there any evidence that the legal representative was not fully aware of the condition of the estate at the time of the assent, as found by the jury to have been given. Walker v. Horton, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 429</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E. 462</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       There being evidence to authorize the inference that due assent to the devise had been given, and no evidence of its revocation or of ground for revocation, a charge to the jury, without qualification, that an assent to a devise cannot be withdrawn, was harmless to the claimant, if erroneous.

      <p>
       Subsection (a) of this section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-9-1(a) and changes the date by which the presumption of death is established from seven years to four years.
   This subsection also indicates that a date of death earlier than the date at the end of the four-year period may be established.
   Subsection (b) retains the concept of the provision in former OCGA Sec. 53-9-1(a) that allowed a petition for letters to be filed after an absence of 12 months provided that death is proved by a preponderance of the evidence.
   Subsection (c) establishes that, regardless of what date of death is established within the four-year period, the missing individual is deemed to have predeceased any individual dying prior to the time of filing the petition and from whom the missing individual would have taken property by will or intestacy or otherwise.

The petition may be made by anyone who would be entitled to file such petition on the estate of the missing individual if the missing individual were known to be dead and shall be filed in the county in which the estate of the missing individual would be administered were the missing individual known to be dead.

The notice required by this subsection may be combined with any other notice required for the issuance of letters or an order for year's support or an order that no administration is necessary. The notice shall be served as provided in Chapter 11 of this title on all individuals who would be heirs if the missing individual were known to be dead. The order may also direct that the petitioner make a search for the missing individual and shall specify the manner in which the search is to be conducted to ensure that, in light of the circumstances of the particular case, a diligent and reasonable effort has been made to locate the missing individual. The order may prescribe any methods of search deemed by the judge to be adequate and appropriate, including but not limited to publishing notices in newspapers in appropriate locations and making inquiry of governmental agencies and of the missing individual's relatives and friends and at the missing individual's last place of abode or other appropriate places.

       This section replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-9-20 (changing the time period from 90 days to 60 days) and former OCGA Sec. 53-9-40.
   This section adds that a conservator may be appointed in any case in which an individual is missing (whose whereabouts may or may not be known) under circumstances that make it impossible for that individual to manage his or her estate.
   Under former OCGA Sec. 53-9-40 et seq., the superior courts had jurisdiction over the estates of persons who were missing due to wartime activities.
   Under this new Article, the probate court has jurisdiction over the estate of any individual who is missing.
   Former OCGA Sec. 53-9-44 (relating to a petition for an order to take action in lieu of a full conservatorship) is repealed.

       This section had no counterpart in former Title 53.
   The section gives the probate court the discretion to select as conservator the person who would best serve the interests of the estate.
   The list of persons whom the probate court may consider reflects the list of persons who may be appointed administrator of an estate that appears at OCGA Sec. 53-6-20. For provisions regarding the eligibility to serve as an administrator, see OCGA Sec. 53-6-2.
   This section also allows the court to refuse to appoint a conservator if other existing arrangements, such as powers of attorney or trusts, indicate that a conservator is not needed.

      The conservator shall within 60 days after appointment make a written report to the probate court setting forth the condition of the estate of the missing individual, together with a schedule of any debts that may be owed by the missing person, an estimate of the income from the estate and the expenses necessary to its preservation, a statement showing the names, ages, and condition of any individuals who may have been dependent on the missing person for support, and a recommendation as to how the estate should be distributed. The court, after considering the report and making any further investigation the court may deem necessary, shall make such order as will most effectively tend to provide for the support of any individuals who may have been dependent upon the missing individual for support and for the handling of the property, including any business or business interest, owned by the missing person. The order may provide for the payment of those debts of the missing person as the court deems just and proper. An order of an appropriate court may allow the conservator to engage in such estate planning dispositions of the missing person's property as are authorized by Code Sections 29-3-36 and 29-5-36. The order may be modified in the discretion of the court at any time upon petition by the conservator, any individual dependent upon the missing individual for support, the guardian of any such individual, or any person having an interest in the property or in any business of the missing individual.

      If an individual domiciled outside this state is possessed of any interest in or claim to or against any real or personal property or cause of action located in this state and would, if a domiciliary, be deemed to be missing in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 53-9-10 or if a conservator or any person serving in a similar capacity shall have been authorized to handle the property of the individual in the jurisdiction in which the individual is domiciled, the probate court may appoint a conservator of all of the interests or claims or causes of action located in this state and give direction as to the conservation of the property and its use in the interest of the missing individual or that individual's dependents, obligees, or successors in interest. The court shall mold such order in aid of any similar orders from the jurisdiction in which the individual is domiciled, may appoint the domiciliary conservator as the conservator in this state, and may authorize delivery of property to the domiciliary conservator. Except as the court may otherwise direct, the proceedings shall conform to the provisions of Article 2 of this chapter.

       - The Simultaneous Death Act becomes applicable if the order of the decedents' deaths cannot be determined by sufficient evidence. Consistent with this interpretation, the burden is on the party whose claim depends upon survivorship to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the person upon whom his or her claim depends survived the other decedent.

Waivers, acknowledgments, consents, answers, objections, or other documents executed by the guardian shall, except as otherwise provided in Code Section 15-9-17, be binding upon the party represented.

      <p>
       This section clarifies that, in all proceedings relating to testate or intestate estates or Year's Support, parties who are legally incapable of acting on behalf of themselves shall be represented by a guardian.
   The term "guardian" means a guardian ad litem appointed by the probate judge for the proceeding.
   However, the probate judge may determine that someone who is already acting as guardian (a natural guardian, guardian of the property, or guardian of the person) may represent the party in the proceeding if the interests of the guardian and the party are not in conflict.
   Some examples of cases where the interests of the guardian and the party represented may be in conflict include cases when the guardian is also a personal representative of the decedent, the propounder of any purported will of the decedent, an heir, a beneficiary under the will of the decedent, or other interested party or cases where the probate court finds for any reason that the interests of the guardian for purposes of a particular proceeding are not common and nonadverse to the interests of the party represented.
   This section does not abrogate any provision of Title 29, such as the provisions of Section 29-4-2(d) requiring the natural guardian to post bond in certain cases where a minor's claim arises under a personal injury lawsuit.
   All petitions filed in the probate court will include the names of those parties who require a guardian and will indicate the identity of any person who is already acting as guardian.
   A copy of the letters of guardianship or other evidence of authority should be attached to or included in the petition.
   However, the probate court may take judicial notice of these letters.

       - Probate court properly reappointed an individual to act as guardian ad litem of unknown heirs in connection with a decedent's will and a declaratory judgment action commenced by a disqualified beneficiary, as there was nothing that prohibited such appointment, and the unknown heirs were entitled to representation pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to declare an order appointing a guardian ad litem void based on the appointment occurring before the probate court judge was recused from the case as only orders made by the probate court judge after the recusal were null and void and the probate court judge appointed the guardian ad litem before the recusal motion was filed.

       - Because the probate court erred in finding that a settlement agreement between heirs to their decedent parent's estate was enforceable, given that a disabled sibling's interests were not represented, and no evidence was presented that a non-disabled sibling assented to or participated in the agreement, the court erred in approving the agreement, warranting a finding that the agreement be set aside.

       - It was proper to dismiss without a hearing a caveat to a will based on lack of testamentary capacity because it was clear that the caveator's allegations were fatally deficient. The caveator had not sought to set aside the probate court's order probating the will; by signing a letter of assent, the caveator had consented to the immediate probate of the will, which established, among other things, that the testator had sufficient mental capacity; and although the caveator contended that distribution of the estate should be governed by an alleged contract between the parties, the caveator had not appealed the probate court's finding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the alleged contract.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Caveat filed by the court-appointed estate administrator was not untimely because, although the testator's children were represented by guardians ad litem and the petition to probate the will was served on the children no later than February 5, 2008, the estate remained unrepresented until an administrator was appointed on May 29, 2008; within 24 hours after appointment, the administrator filed a caveat to the will; and the administrator's objection to the proceeding in probate court was filed no later than 10 days after the date the person filing the objection was personally served.

The comments appearing in this chapter have been prepared under the supervision of the Georgia Trust Code Revision Committee of the Fiduciary Law Section of the State Bar of Georgia and are included in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated at the request of the Committee. The comments were prepared by Anne S. Emanuel, Associate Professor at Georgia State University College of Law, reporter to the Georgia Trust Code Revision Committee, and were reviewed by the members of the Committee: William J. Linkous, Jr. and James H. Morgan, Jr., Co-Chairmen; Henry L. Bowden, Jr., Subcommittee Chairman; Michael D. Alembik, A. Kimbrough Davis, Herbert Elsas, John M. Graham, Barbara C. Hipple, S. Davis Laney, Joseph C. Miller, Jeffrey Pennell, James C. Rehburg, and Albert P. Reichert, Jr. They were presented to the General Assembly, in substantially this form, as part of the explanation for the changes proposed from prior law, and to clarify the meaning of the Act. Neither the General Assembly of Georgia nor the Code Revision Commission of the State of Georgia has participated in the drafting of these comments or has reviewed the comments for their content. The comments should not be considered to constitute a statement of legislative intention by the General Assembly of Georgia nor do they have the force of statutory law.

       - Rights of the decedent's surviving spouse were already vested when the Revised Georgia Trust Code of 2010 (Revised Code), O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c12s53-12-1" target="_self">53-12-1</a></cite> et seq., was enacted because under the terms of the amended trust agreement, the surviving spouse's rights to the trust assets took effect upon the decedent's death before the Revised Code took effect. Accordingly, any new obligation imposed by the Revised Code that would have impaired the surviving spouse's right to possession could not be applied retroactively. Rose v. Waldrip, <cite class="ga_app_court">316 Ga. App. 812</cite>, <cite class="app_court">730 S.E.2d 529</cite> (2012), cert. denied, No. S12C1888, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 981 (Ga. 2012).

       - Revised Georgia Trust Code's provisions apply to any trust irrespective of the date the trust was created, with two exceptions: to the extent it would impair vested rights, and except as otherwise provided by law. There is no vested right in a statute of limitation, and to the extent that Mayfield v. Heiman, <cite class="ga_app_court">317 Ga. App. 322</cite>,

       - In a breach of trust action, the trial court did not apply an incorrect standard of care in that a co-trustee could only be held liable if the co-trustee failed to act in good faith because if there was any error, the error was created by the co-trustee since the co-trustee consented to the instructions given and failed to request a charge that clearly set forth what the co-trustee asserted to be the proper standard for acts performed with absolute discretion.

        An express trust cannot be created by parol
       
       and engrafted on an absolute deed. An express trust may not be impressed by parol evidence upon a deed. Fowler v. Montgomery, <cite class="ga_court">254 Ga. 118</cite>, <cite class="app_court">326 S.E.2d 765</cite> (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        Trusts are implied:
       
       (1) whenever the legal title is in one person, but the beneficial interest, either from the payment of the purchase money or other circumstances, is either wholly or partially in another; (2) when, from any fraud, one person obtains the title to property which rightly belongs to another; and (3) when, from the nature of the transaction, it is manifest that it was the intention of the parties that the person taking the legal title shall have no beneficial interest. Hemphill v. Hemphill, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 585</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 878</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §§
   3732 and 3739).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Implied trusts are divided into two categories:
       
       resulting trusts and constructive trusts, and sometimes it is exceedingly difficult to differentiate between the two; but ordinarily distinctions are unnecessary since both are implied trusts and are governed by the same rules. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 684</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §§
   108-104 and 108-106).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Implied trusts are either resulting or constructive, the latter arising if there is fraudulent conduct and no intent of the parties is involved. The implied resulting trust is based on the intention of the parties. Hall v. Higgison, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 373</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 808</cite> (1966) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-106).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Generally, trusts arising under the first and third classification are resulting trusts, while those arising under the second classification are constructive trusts. Not infrequently in the case of resulting trusts no fraud exists, such trusts resting primarily on an implication of law from the nature of the transaction; but generally, if not necessarily, the element of fraud is present in constructive trusts. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 684</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Constructive trust is an implied trust,
       
       and it has long been the rule in this state that implied trusts are not within the statute of frauds. Williams v. Whitfield, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 639</cite>, <cite class="app_court">250 S.E.2d 486</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code 1933,

       An implied trust may arise from the payment of a portion of the purchase money.
      
      A trust of this kind does not arise from, or depend upon, any agreement between the parties. It results from the fact that one person's money has been invested in land, and the conveyance taken in the name of another. It is a mere creature of equity. Hudson v.

        There are certain well-established rules of law which must be met
       
       in order to create a trust. First, it must be shown that the money was not a loan. In order for a trust to result from paying only a part of the purchase money, the actual amount must be proven. It is indispensable that the purchase money be paid before or at the time of the purchase. Reed v.

       "The person in whose favor a trust is claimed to result must pay the purchase money as his own; if he merely advances it as a loan, no trust will result." So, while it is true that M. did retain the physical custody of the policy, and advanced the money with which to pay the premiums, yet these premiums were charged against the insured on the insured's general account with that firm and no implied trust was created. The mere physical custody of the policy would not, of itself create a trust. Johnston v.

       Essential ingredient which gives rise to a constructive trust is fraud,
      
      and if the question involves a deed to land, and the legal title to the land is sought to be recovered by the enforcement of an oral agreement to reconvey the land, fraud must have existed contemporaneously with the acquisition of the land by the one who is sought to be charged as trustee ex maleficio.

      An implied trust arises wherever a person acquires the legal title to land or other property by means of an intentionally false and fraudulent verbal promise to hold the property for a certain specified purpose; and after having thus fraudulently obtained title, one retains, uses, and claims the property absolutely as one's own, so that the whole transaction by means of which the ownership is obtained is in fact a scheme of actual deceit.

      When a conveyance absolute in form is made to one person, but when the circumstances show that the real intention of the parties was not to make an absolute conveyance but a conveyance with restrictions or reservations, when it is alleged and appears that there was fraud on the part of the grantee to induce the execution of the deed, a court of equity will set up an implied trust in the property, by construing the conveyance so as to do full justice to the parties as their interests may appear and in such cases the courts have held that to allow an oral agreement to be set up which restricts the original instrument does not contravene the statute of frauds, since the jurisdiction of the court is predicated upon the fraud of the grantee; and the parol evidence rule does not exclude oral testimony which tends to establish the fraud and show the real intention of the parties.

      Evidence that the petitioner had an agreement with the defendant whereby they were to jointly buy the land sued for, that the petitioner delivered the petitioner's half of the purchase money to the defendant, and trusted the defendant to pay the purchase money and obtain a deed conveying the land to the defendant and the petitioner jointly, that the petitioner had received one-half of the proceeds from the sale and lease of timber on the land, that the defendant had stated to two other persons that the petitioner owned an undivided one-half interest in the land, but that the defendant, in violation of the agreement, procured a deed of conveyance of the land in which the defendant alone was named as grantee, was sufficient to show an implied trust and to authorize a verdict in favor of the petitioner for the recovery of an undivided one-half interest in the land.

      Under the evidence as to the existence of a partnership between the petitioner and the defendant and their agreement to jointly purchase the land involved, and evidence that the petitioner paid one-half of the purchase money and trusted the defendant to close the deal and obtain a conveyance naming them both as grantees, the defendant could not obtain an interest in the land antagonistic to that of the petitioner; and when the defendant procured a deed, in the defendant's own name only, equity would annul the conveyance and decree title in the petitioner to the petitioner's share.

      Statute expressly recognizes trusts which arise ex maleficio; such a trust occurs whenever a person acquires the legal title to land or other property by means of an intentionally false and fraudulent verbal promise to hold the property for a certain specified purpose.

      When defendant obtained money by fraud and trickery ("the telegram racket") in order to prevent the defendant from taking advantage of defendant's own wrong, a naked, constructive, ex maleficio trust would be imposed by operation of law upon the property thus obtained even though it was contrary to the defendant's intention and will, and the defendant became a trustee ex maleficio for such property; the defendant was trustee ex maleficio of a naked ex maleficio trust, which required no action on defendant's part beyond the turning over or returning of the money to the beneficiary, the victim. Cordovano v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">61 Ga. App. 590</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 45</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Complainant who seeks relief based on the doctrine of trusts ex maleficio must allege more than the breach of a verbal promise. There must be an unequivocal allegation of positive fraud accompanying the promise, by means of which the acquisition of the legal title was consummated. General allegations as to an entire course of fraudulent conduct are not sufficient in the absence of a specific averment that the promise was made to be broken. Mays v.

       When one purchasing property places title in another for one's own convenience,
      
      an implied trust exists. Belch v. Sprayberry, <cite class="ga_app_court">97 Ga. App. 47</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 870</cite> (1958) (decided under former Code 1933,

      <p>

       An implied trust results from the fact that
      
      one person's money has been invested in land and the conveyance taken in the name of another. Barnes v. Barnes, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 226</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E.2d 390</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,

      When the husband buys land with money which is the separate estate of his wife, and takes the title in his own name, in the absence of any evidence that the wife had given or loaned her money to him, the law raises an implied trust in favor of the wife, and makes the husband her trustee holding the property in trust for her sole use and benefit.

      When a deed to realty is executed to two grantees, one of whom pays a part of both the initial and subsequent payments to retire a loan on the property, and such payments amount to more than that one's portion of the undertaking, an implied trust upon the interest of the other grantee is established in proportion to the amount of purchase money paid thereon. Estes v. Estes, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 814</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 217</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

      When an initial payment is made by one at the time of the execution of the conveyance taken in the name of another, this would support the establishment of a trust in the payor, and subsequent payments made by the payor should be considered to fix the extent of the trust interest.

      When a grantee holds property impressed with a constructive trust in favor of the grantor, and conveys such property to another, who has notice and knowledge of the circumstances creating the constructive trust, the latter takes the property subject to the equities of the original grantor, and is a proper party in a suit seeking to impress the property with a constructive trust.

        Resulting trust will be implied for the benefit of the testator,
       
       which of course means the testator's estate, rather than for the benefit of the testator's heirs or next of kin when the testator's will contains a residuary clause which disposes of all the rest or residue of the testator's estate, a trust having been created in another provision of the testator's will but no express disposition of the remainder thereafter having been made.

       An implied trust never arises out of a contract or agreement
      
      between the parties, but arises by implication of law from their acts and conduct apart from any contract. It is only necessary to allege and prove that one person furnished the purchase money for the land in controversy, and that the deed was taken in the name of the person to whom the money was so furnished. No presumption of a gift or loan arises. Hudson v. Evans, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">32 S.E.2d 793</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,

Smith v. Harvey-Given Co., <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 410</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 793</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
      An implied trust may arise from a payment of a portion of the purchase money. An express oral promise by the grantee to hold in trust for another will not operate to defeat a resulting trust, where, on the special equities growing out of the transaction, the law would, in the absence of such agreement, imply a trust. Wells v. Wells, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 586</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933,

       If an agent places money in the hands of a bank to be delivered to the agent's principal,
      
      a trust arises in favor of the latter, and acceptance of the money with notice of its ultimate destination creates a duty on the part of the bank to devote it to the purpose intended, and equity will enforce the trust, and if those funds are mingled with its general assets, and go to swell its general estate, the trust therefor attaches to the entire estate, even though the specific funds cannot be traced. Salzburger Bank v. Standard Oil Co., <cite class="ga_court">173 Ga. 722</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 584</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

      Agency being established, the agent will be held to be a trustee as to any profits, advantages, rights, or privileges under any contract made and obtained within the scope and by reason of such agency; and when the agent invests such profits in property or places the property to the agent's credit in a bank, the agent will be held to hold the property as trustee for the principal, and the latter can maintain in a court of equity an action to trace such profits into such investments, and to enjoin the agent or the agent's donee from selling, disposing of, or incumbering any such profits or any property in which the property has been invested.

       Constructive trust arises not from the intent of the parties, but by equity

      Assuming that the remedies at law are inadequate, if a plaintiff proves that a defendant promised to repay a loan and did so without a present intent to perform, the plaintiff can enforce either a constructive trust or an equitable lien on the fund, and, further, if a plaintiff proves that the fraudulently procured funds were used by the defendant to purchase other property, the plaintiff can reach the other property by a proceeding in equity, and can enforce a constructive trust or an equitable lien.

       - Assuming that a widow's counterclaim against her late husband's two siblings for failure to continue mortgage payments on a home that the husband had bought for another sibling was for a constructive trust on the property, the widow was not entitled to summary judgment because the familial gift presumption applicable to purchase money resulting trusts could apply, or the husband's contributions toward the home could be considered gifts or voluntary payments.

       - As long as a person who is in possession of the property of another, using the property for the owner's benefit, recognizes the latter's ownership, no lapse of time will bar the owner from asserting the owner's title as against the person in possession. Before any lapse of time will be a bar to the owner, it must appear that the person in possession has given notice or there must be circumstances shown which would be equivalent to notice, to the owner that the person in possession claims adversely to the owner. In such a case the statute will begin to run from the date of such notice. Until the owner has such notice, the owner has the right to treat the possession of the other person as the person's own.

       - Former Code 1933,
   §
   108-501 created a method, unknown to the common law, by which a person having a claim against a trust estate for services rendered to the estate, for articles of property or money furnished for the use of the estate, or any claim for the payment of which a court of equity would render the estate liable, may pursue directly the assets of the estate itself. In such actions the trustee is made defendant. A judgment rendered in such proceeding does not impose liability upon the trustee personally, but binds only the trust estate. Oberdorfer v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 336</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 308</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933,

   108-501).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Claim against a trust estate "for services rendered to said estate, or for articles or property or money furnished for the use of said estate, or any claim for the payment of which a court of equity would render said estate liable," may be enforced in a court of law, and in such a case the trustees are the only necessary parties. Zeigler v. Perry, <cite class="ga_app_court">37 Ga. App. 647</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E. 426</cite> (1928) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3786 et seq.)
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        This new remedy is merely cumulative of common law,
       
       and it does not abolish the common law liability of the trustee personally either in tort or contract. Thus, if one wishes, a claimant may bring an action against the trustee individually. Oberdorfer v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 336</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 308</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-501).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ordinarily, a charitable institution or corporation is not liable for the negligence of its officers and employees unless it fails to exercise ordinary care in their selection or fails to exercise such care in retaining them. A petition praying for general damages to be satisfied in part from charitable trust funds fails to state a cause of action when the petition fails to allege that the defendant was negligent in selecting or retaining employees. Burgess v. James, <cite class="ga_app_court">73 Ga. App. 857</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 637</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-501).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       By parity of reasoning as regards those cases of statutory money rule against levying officers, which are not equity cases, and those of set off allowed by statute, the pursuit of the remedy allowed by statute does not make an "equity case" of which the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction. Robinson v. Lindsey, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 684</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 910</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Claim against trust estate for services or for articles or money furnished to trust estate may be enforced in either court of law or court of equity. But in order to subject a trust estate to an obligation, the specific facts which render the estate liable for the debt claimed must be alleged and established by evidence. Aiken v.

       To preserve a trust estate, to supervise the estate's management, to hold the trustee to the line of duty, for the purpose of preserving the trust's corpus for the benefit of the beneficiaries, is an elementary branch of equity jurisprudence. The judge of the superior court of each county has power, either in term or at chambers, to remove and appoint trustees. When a court of equity obtains jurisdiction for one purpose, it will proceed to give full relief to all parties with reference to the subject matter of the action where it has jurisdiction for that purpose. Fine v. Saul, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 309</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 439</cite> (1936) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-501).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If a will expressly creates a trust and imposes special fiduciary duties on the person named executor, not as executor but as a trustee, and the executor has expressly or impliedly assented to the gift and taken over the property as trustee, it is plain that the executor is not amenable to a proceeding in the court of ordinary (now probate court), brought by a legatee for an accounting and settlement with respect to the trust; but relief must be sought by equitable action in the superior court where the defendant resides. McDowell v. McDowell, <cite class="ga_app_court">68 Ga. App. 363</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 851</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-501).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although a will does not in terms create a trust, yet the manifest purpose of the language and the exigencies of the case require that equity shall decree and enforce a trust, the trust will be raised by implication, and the rule is the same. McDowell v. McDowell, <cite class="ga_app_court">68 Ga. App. 363</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 851</cite> (1942) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Courts of equity have jurisdiction to compel trustees to account for the trust funds in their hands,
       
       especially when the accounts are complicated. Keaton v. Greenwood, <cite class="ga_court">8 Ga. 97</cite> (1850) (decided under former law).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Probate court properly found that the court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a petition seeking an order from the court voiding a trust created by a guardian's brother for the benefit of a ward and seeking return of the assets in the trust to the ward as trusts of every kind were peculiarly subjects of equity jurisdiction. In re Longino, <cite class="ga_app_court">281 Ga. App. 599</cite>, <cite class="app_court">636 S.E.2d 683</cite> (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 92 (Ga. 2007) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        If trustee omits to act when required by duty to do so,
       
       or is wanting in necessary care and diligence in the due execution of the trust which the trustee has undertaken, a court of equity will interpose. Jones v. Dougherty, <cite class="ga_court">10 Ga. 273</cite> (1851) (decided under former law); Fine v. Saul, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 309</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 439</cite> (1936);(decided under former Code 1933,

       If the trustee omits to act when required by duty to do so, or is wanting in necessary care and diligence in the due execution of the trust which the trustee has undertaken, a court of equity will interpose. The relief granted will always be molded and framed so as to render the trust effectual, and secure the best interests of all parties. A court of equity, having assumed jurisdiction over the trust for one purpose, will give effect to all the rights of the beneficiaries. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="ga_court">167 Ga. 1</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E. 787</cite> (1928) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       If the plaintiffs seek to get a judgment against a trust estate for services rendered for such estate, plaintiffs must bring their action in accordance with the law; an ordinary judgment cannot be stretched to fit such circumstances.

       This entire statute simply means that any person having a valid claim against a trust estate may collect and enforce the payment of the claim without resorting to a court of equity, and the statute does not limit the liability of trust estates to the payment of such claims only as are indicated by the words "for services rendered to said estate, or for articles, or property, or money, furnished for the use of said estate."

       - In an appeal of an order granting a trustees' motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty, the court of appeals proceeded under the Revised Georgia Trust Code, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c12s53-12-1" target="_self">53-12-1</a></cite> et seq., as supplemented by the common law because even assuming that past distributions under the trust amounted to vested rights, the plaintiff could not show that the Revised Trust Code created any new trustees' obligations or impaired those rights in any relevant way; although the Revised Trust Code did not require a trustee to consider the resources of any beneficiary when determining whether to distribute trust property, O.C.G.A.

       - Trial court erred in concluding that a widow's considerable powers of control over two testamentary trusts as trustee and executor entitled her to summary judgment on two of the children's/beneficiaries' claims against the trust created for the purpose of supporting them during their lifetimes; she was required to diligently and in good faith ascertain whether they required support, and her powers over the assets did not entitle her to commit waste.

       - Jury question was presented as to whether two trustees of their children's trusts acted against the interests of the beneficiaries (their children) in bad faith by amending a partnership agreement to concentrate all voting power in themselves to the exclusion of the beneficiaries, who otherwise would have become partners when they turned 45. Likewise, the trustees as partners owed duties to the trusts as partners in the partnership. Rollins v. Rollins, <cite class="ga_app_court">338 Ga.

      Parol evidence.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - In all cases when a trust is sought to be implied, a court may hear parol evidence of the nature of the transaction, or the circumstances, or conduct of the parties, either to imply or rebut a trust. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3739).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    While an express trust must be created by writing and cannot be proved by parol, implied trusts may be established by parol evidence, although the effect of such evidence is to alter or vary a written instrument, and although the defendant sets up and insists upon the statute of frauds. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3739).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Principle in former Civil Code 1910,
    
    §
    
     3258 (see O.C.G.A.
    
    §
    
    <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.44.html#t44c14s44-14-32" target="_blank">44-14-32</a></cite>)
    
    that "a deed or bill of sale, absolute on its face, and accompanied by possession of the property, shall not be proved (at the instance of the parties) by parol to be a mortgage only, unless fraud in its procurement is the issue to be tried," is not applicable to an action seeking to set up an implied trust. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   3739).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Promises made deceitfully for purpose of accomplishing fraudulent designs,
    
    whatever may be their terms, do not, unless reduced to writing, raise express trusts; but the law, acting upon them according to their nature, makes them a basis upon which to build up in favor of the defrauded party an implied trust. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

    - When father executed to plaintiff's sister a deed to land, absolute upon its face, with the agreement between all of them that the sister was to deed a specified portion of the land to plaintiff (her brother) whenever he or the father requested its execution, such an agreement, if properly executed in writing, would create an express trust; however, when the plaintiff tendered no written evidence but sought to establish the agreement by parol testimony, the court did not err in directing a verdict for the defendant, as plaintiff was attempting to assert an express trust and engraft it on a deed by parol, which cannot be done.

    - While fraudulent undertakings or promises, whatever their terms, do not unless reduced to writing raise express trusts, the law, acting upon them according to their nature, makes them a basis upon which to build up in favor of the defrauded party an implied or constructive trust. Pittman v. Pittman, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 397</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 764</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

     An implied trust may rest upon express parol agreement,

     Implied trusts are such as are inferred by law from the nature of the transaction
    
    or conduct of parties, and are either resulting or constructive. Hemphill v. Hemphill, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 585</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 878</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1910,

    When temporary administrator brought an equitable action alleging that the administrator's intestate had purchased certain real estate and had agreed to place title jointly in the defendant's name in order to secure a debt owed defendant, and that defendant was to reconvey title to deceased and had refused to reconvey the half interest held in the defendant's name, the temporary administrator has alleged an implied trust in favor of the estate of the intestate from the facts and circumstances. Royal v. Lane, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 375</cite>, <cite class="app_court">104 S.E.2d 901</cite> (1958) (decided under former Code 1933,

    When a grantee holds property impressed with a constructive trust in favor of the grantor, and conveys such property to another who has notice and knowledge of the circumstances creating the constructive trust, the latter takes the property subject to the equities of the original grantor and is a proper party in an action seeking to impress the property with a constructive trust. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 684</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

    When the contract of rescission was executed, the equity in the house and lot reverted to the vendor (in an exchange of property), and it became impressed with a trust, and the vendee held it for the benefit of the vendor as an implied trust.

    When deed was wholly without any good or valuable consideration, other than trust assumed by grantee (to sell the land and pay grantors their half interest in the proceeds), and the only title at all that grantee could have had was a title in trust, claim of grantors was not an attempt to engraft on an otherwise good and valid absolute deed an extraneous parol trust, but an effort either to void the deed or else to sustain the deed in the only way that it might possibly be given effect, if allowed to have any effect at all.

    - Trust is implied when from any fraud one person obtains title to property which rightfully belongs to another. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    An implied trust arises wherever a person acquires the legal title to land or other property by means of an intentionally false and fraudulent verbal promise to hold the land for a certain specified purpose, and after having thus fraudulently obtained title, one retains, uses, and claims the property absolutely as one's own, so that the whole transaction by means of which the ownership is obtained is in fact a scheme of actual deceit. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

    If by a false and fraudulent oral promise, which one intends at the time of making it afterwards to violate, the vendee of two contiguous parcels of land, which one has contracted for by separate and distinct contracts, induces the vendor to convey to one both parcels by one and the same absolute unconditional deed, one paying for one parcel but not for the other, equity by reason of one's fraud will fasten upon one a constructive trust on behalf of the vendor, as to the parcel not paid for, although the two parcels are not described in the deed as several tracts, but both together are treated as one tract. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §§
   3731 and 3739).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    When a conveyance absolute in form is made to one person, but the circumstances show that the real intention of the parties was not to make an absolute conveyance but a conveyance with restrictions or reservations, when it is alleged and appears that there was fraud on the part of the grantee to induce the execution of the deed, a court of equity will set up an implied trust in the property, by construing the conveyance so as to do full justice to the parties as their interests may appear, and in such cases the courts have held that to allow an oral agreement to be set up which restricts the original instrument does not contravene the statute of frauds, since the jurisdiction of the court is predicated upon the fraud of the grantee; and the parol evidence rule does not exclude oral testimony which tends to establish the fraud and show the real intention of the parties. Jansen v. Jansen, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 654</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

    <p>
     <p>
    While it is the general rule that a parol trust cannot be grafted on an absolute deed, such instrument must be taken to mean a deed which is valid, not one without any good or valuable consideration, under which the grantee holds in fraud; under such circumstances, even though the language might otherwise be construed as setting up an express trust, it will nevertheless be taken as negativing any intent or purpose to pass title, and for such purpose it will be held to create a valid implied trust insofar as it imposes duties and obligations naturally arising from the nature of the transaction and the conduct of the parties. Pittman v. Pittman, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 397</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 764</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

    While an express trust can only be shown by a writing, an implied trust may rest upon an express parol agreement, fraudulently made, by which a person acquires title to property of another; and in such case the express promise or agreement may be proved by parol to raise not an express but implied trust. Jenkins v. Lane, <cite class="ga_court">154 Ga. 454</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E. 126</cite> (1922) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

    An implied trust results from the fact that one person's money has been invested in land, and the conveyance taken in the name of another. Bullard v. Bullard, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 122</cite>, <cite class="app_court">103 S.E.2d 570</cite> (1958) (decided under former Code 1933,

    Trusts are implied whenever the legal title is in one person, but the beneficial interest, either from the payment of the purchase money or other circumstances, is either wholly or partially in another.

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    When the purchase money for a tract of land was paid by one and the title thereto taken in the name of one's brother, an implied trust arises. Such a trust does not arise from an agreement but by implication of law from acts and conduct. Stevens v.

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    In order to set up an implied resulting trust in favor of one paying the purchase money where the title is placed in another, it is indispensable that it be shown that the purchase price was paid by the beneficiary of the trust at or before the time the conveyance was made, or that it be shown, other than by a void parol agreement, that it was the intent and purpose of the parties at the time the conveyance was made that the one claiming the benefit of the trust should pay the purchase money in conformity with such original intent and purpose of the parties. Such intent may be established by proof of an initial payment by the one claiming the benefit of the trust, at or before the time the title is conveyed to another. Loggins v. Daves, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 628</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 520</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

If, however, it is made to appear from all the alleged facts and circumstances surrounding a transaction that an implied trust was established, the mere fact that there may have been an abortive attempt to establish by parol an express trust does not operate to destroy the implied trust which the facts and circumstances otherwise establish.

       When two persons buy land jointly and the deed is made to a third person in trust a reformation of the deed, conveying the land to third parties, is not authorized, because an express trust cannot be engrafted on a deed by parol. Wilder v. Wilder, <cite class="ga_court">138 Ga. 573</cite>, <cite class="app_court">75 S.E. 654</cite> (1912) (decided under former Code 1910,

        <p>
       While it is the general rule that a parol trust cannot be grafted on an absolute deed, such instrument must be taken to mean a deed which is valid, not one without any good or valuable consideration, under which the grantee holds in fraud; under such circumstances, even though the language might otherwise be construed as setting up an express trust, it will nevertheless be taken as negativing any intent or purpose to pass title, and for such purpose it will be held to create a valid implied trust, insofar as it imposes duties and obligations naturally arising from the nature of the transaction and the conduct of the parties. Pittman v. Pittman, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 397</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 764</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       A verdict and decree in the plaintiff's favor for a one-half undivided interest in the property, if based upon the express agreement as to the interest to be owned by each of the parties, and not upon the proportion of the purchase money paid, would manifestly impinge upon the rule that an express trust cannot be created by parol and accordingly, any recovery or decree in the plaintiff's favor must be in proportion to the amount of the purchase money paid by the plaintiff, and could not be based upon the express agreement. Hemphill v. Hemphill, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 585</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 878</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When deed was wholly without any good or valuable consideration, other than trust assumed by grantee (to sell the land and pay grantors their half interest in the proceeds) and the only title at all that grantee could have had was a title in trust, claim of grantors was not an attempt to engraft on an otherwise good and valid absolute deed an extraneous parol trust, but an effort either to void the deed, or else to sustain it in the only way that it might possibly be given effect, if allowed to have any effect at all. Pittman v. Pittman, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 397</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 764</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the father executed to plaintiff's sister a deed to land, absolute upon the deed's face, with the agreement between all of them that the sister was to deed a specified portion of the land to plaintiff (her brother) whenever he or the father requested its execution, such an agreement, if properly executed in writing, would create an express trust; however, when the plaintiff tendered no written evidence, but sought to establish the agreement by parol testimony, the court did not err in directing a verdict for the defendant, as plaintiff was attempting to assert an express trust and engraft it on a deed by parol, which cannot be done. Jones v. Jones, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 492</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 602</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

       As all express trusts must be created or declared in writing, an express trust may not be impressed by parol evidence upon a deed. Fowler v. Montgomery, <cite class="ga_court">254 Ga. 118</cite>, <cite class="app_court">326 S.E.2d 765</cite> (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       An attempt made to fasten upon the property an express trust upon a parol agreement, is forbidden, as all express trusts must be in writing, or else the express trusts are not enforceable as such. Mays v. Perry, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 729</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 698</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

        When the parol agreement is a mere attempt to create an express trust,
       
       as such it is invalid as to any of the property because such a trust can be created only in writing. Caswell v. Caswell, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 153</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E. 748</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       When plaintiff purportedly conveyed a duplex to plaintiff's son by a duly recorded deed stating that the conveyance was for $10 and other valuable consideration, and plaintiff did not require any agreement in writing as to the true consideration for the deed, which was that the plaintiff was to have a right of possession of an apartment on the premises for the balance of plaintiff's life, this was an attempt to set up an express trust by parol, and plaintiff obtained no interest under this alleged agreement. Smith v. Lynch, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 338</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 175</cite> (1954) (decided under former law).

       Petition seeking to establish an implied trust will fail when all the allegations relied on are based solely upon an oral agreement setting up an invalid express trust. If, however, it is made to appear from all the alleged facts and circumstances surrounding a transaction that an implied trust was established, the mere fact that there may have been an abortive attempt to establish by parol an express trust, does not operate to destroy the implied trust which the facts and circumstances otherwise establish. Johnson v. Upchurch, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 762</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 617</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

        When an express trust is not created by writing,
       
       the plaintiff must recover, if at all, upon an implied trust. Bryant v. Green, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 874</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E. 123</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - Decedent's will unambiguously created a charitable trust rather than an outright devise subject to a condition subsequent as: (1) the decedent plainly stated the decedent's express intent to devise the decedent's home to an organization that would maintain the property in perpetuity for conservation purposes; (2) the decedent also bequeathed gardening equipment to the same organization, clearly for the purpose of tending the land that the corporation had been given and was expected to hold as trustee; (3) the devise reflected all of the composite elements of an express trust; and (4) the failure of the will to use the terms "trust" and "trustee" did not alter the outcome.

       When a person has used language from which it can be gathered that the person intended to create a trust, such intention is not negatived by the surrounding circumstances, the settlor has done such things as are necessary in equity to bind oneself not to recede from that intention, the trust property is of such a nature as to be legally capable of being settled, the object of the trust is lawful, and the settlor had complied with the provisions of law as to evidence, a good and valid declaration of trust has (prima facie) been made. No technical terms or expressions need be used. It is sufficient if the language used shows that the settlor intended to create a trust, and clearly points out the property, beneficiary, and disposition to be made of the property. McCreary v. Gewinner, <cite class="ga_court">103 Ga. 528</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E. 960</cite> (1898) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

        Trust is an equitable obligation, either express or implied,
       
       resting upon a person by reason of a confidence reposed in the person, to apply or deal with property for the benefit of some other person, or for the benefit of that person and another or others, according to such confidence.

        Majority rule appears to be
       
       that funds paid by a mortgagor to an escrow account to be used by the mortgagee to meet tax and insurance obligations upon the property as those obligations accrue do not constitute trust properties such as would render the mortgagee accountable to the mortgagor for any earnings or profits from the funds.

       Estates may be created not for the benefit of the grantee but for the use of some other person; they are termed trust estates; no formal words are necessary to create such an estate and whenever a manifest intention is exhibited that another person shall have the benefit of the property the grantee shall be declared a trustee.

       When a person makes a deposit in a savings bank in the person's own name as trustee for another person, retains the bank book, gives notice to the beneficiary, makes withdrawals from the deposits in the account, and dies leaving the account unexplained, the beneficiary is entitled to the balance remaining at the death of the depositor, unless evidence is produced that overcomes the legal presumption in favor of the trust, by showing that the depositor never intended to create a trust, or has revoked the trust.

       Testator devised his property as follows: I will to my wife, R, for her to give to our children as they arrive of age as she may be able, keeping a memorandum so as each child shall be equal. It was held, that "the words 'for her to give,'" etc., in the will, construed in connection with the rest of the item, are not such precatory or recommendatory words as will create a trust. It is left discretionary with her to give off to the children as she is able, and it is not declared what she shall give off, whether the entire share of each child or only a part. Had the intention been apparent that the wife should hold or use the property for the benefit of the children during minority, a trust would have been created, although the words were not mandatory in form.

       Words, "I give, to my beloved wife, my wagons, buggy, and also my household and kitchen furniture, all without limitation or reserve, for her to do as she thinks best for herself and all of my lawful heirs," are not sufficient precatory words to create a trust because the wife was first given without reserve or limitation.

       Provisions in the will requiring the testator's wife to make an inventory, to sell at public or private sale, make a final return and instructing the ordinary (now probate judge) to discharge the executor do no more than protect creditors and follow the law applicable to executors, and in nowise diminish the fee simple estate therein devised.

       Trust was improperly modified to forego any distributions to a beneficiary, who had been charged with aggravated assault and battery of the settlor's spouse, because the record did not establish that the assault was motivated by the beneficiary's greed for the trust receipts, rather than by the beneficiary's mental condition, which had required appointment of a guardian ad litem.

       - Because a husband was both the settlor and the sole beneficiary of a trust and to have allowed him to shield his assets with a spendthrift clause would have been contrary to both express law and policy, the spendthrift clause was invalid and unenforceable, and did not protect the trust property from claims for alimony or property division.

       - In a case in which the issue was whether the campaign funds of the debtor, a candidate for public office who filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy without incorporating the campaign, were the property of the bankruptcy estate, the spendthrift trust exception to the anti-alienation provision in 11 U.S.C.
   §
   541(c)(1)(A) did not apply because the campaign funds were not held in a spendthrift trust under Georgia law. There was no evidence of a writing creating an express trust, let alone an express trust containing a valid spendthrift provision as required under O.C.G.A.

        Resulting trust is an implied-in-fact or inferred trust.
       
       It is not based upon fraud or misrepresentation. On the contrary, the basis of the true constructive trust is fraud, actual or "constructive." Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">150 Ga. 544</cite>, <cite class="app_court">104 S.E. 236</cite> (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §§
   3740 and 3741).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When A pays the purchase money and causes the deed to be made to A's spouse, and an oral agreement to hold in trust for A is shown to rebut the presumption of gift, the majority view is that the trust is nevertheless resulting if the oral agreement is not different from the agreement which would be implied if the grantee were legally a stranger to A. Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">150 Ga. 544</cite>, <cite class="app_court">104 S.E. 236</cite> (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §§
   3740 and 3741).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a divorce, a husband did not show that the transfer of the marital home to the wife for "love and affection" to protect the home from possible future creditors created an implied resulting trust under which the wife held the home for the husband because the husband did not show an express trust had been created or fully performed without exhausting trust property. Brock v. Brock, <cite class="ga_court">279 Ga. 119</cite>, <cite class="app_court">610 S.E.2d 29</cite> (2005) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Repayment of the loan was not a transfer of an interest of the debtor's property and, therefore, not voidable as a preferential treatment since the funds were loaned to be applied to pay a specific creditor, debtor deposited the funds into a checking account the sole purpose of which was to satisfy that obligation, the debtor understood that the funds could not be used for any other purpose, and the balance in the account always exceeded the amount of the loan before the debtor repaid defendant.

       - Resulting trust may be rebutted even by parol declarations of the person in whose favor the trust would otherwise be raised; and it is effectually rebutted by a subsequent deed taken by the same parties proffering to follow the very same trusts.

       - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a record title holder in a quiet title action because a disputed question of material fact existed whether the holder had agreed to deed back the properties at issue to the claimant after financing fell through; thus, a dispute existed as to whether a constructive trust should be implied under the circumstances.

       Trial court erred in granting an ex-husband summary judgment as to the ex-wife's and mother's implied trust claim because there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether an implied constructive trust arose at the time of the 2008 conveyance.

       Assuming that a widow's counterclaim against her late husband's two siblings for failure to continue mortgage payments on a home that the husband had bought for another sibling was for a constructive trust on the property, the widow was not entitled to summary judgment because the familial gift presumption applicable to purchase money resulting trusts could apply, or the husband's contributions toward the home could be considered gifts or voluntary payments.

       - As between husband and wife, parent and child, brother and brother, or sister and sister, payment of the purchase money of land by one of the correlatives, and causing the conveyance to be made to the other, will generally suggest an intention to make a gift. This may or may not prevent a resulting trust, according to the circumstances of the particular transaction. Certainly, a trust for the benefit of the one paying the money does not necessarily result. Printup v. Patton &amp; Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">91 Ga. 422</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E. 311</cite> (1893) (decided under former law).

        <p>
       - When the court charged that if the husband conveyed property to the wife and she paid the remainder of the purchase price without anything showing that it was for the purpose of securing the part paid, a presumption arises that it was a gift which may be rebutted; there was no application and the principle announced in Gould v. Glass, <cite class="ga_court">120 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E. 505</cite> (1904). Barnett v. Strain, <cite class="ga_court">151 Ga. 553</cite>, <cite class="app_court">107 S.E. 530</cite> (1921) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       Whenever a husband acquires the separate property of his wife, with or without her consent, he must be deemed to hold the property in trust for her benefit, in the absence of any direct evidence that she intended to make a gift of the property to him. Barber v. Barber, <cite class="ga_court">125 Ga. 226</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E. 1017</cite> (1906) (decided under former law).

        After a debtor appealed a bankruptcy court's order finding that the debtor's transfer of half interest in three lots of real property to the debtor's spouse was a fraudulent conveyance, the debtor's spouse was not entitled to an implied purchase money resulting trust. The spouse did not pay consideration for the property to be transferred to the debtor when the debtor initially acquired the property, and the spouse did not own a half interest in the property by virtue of a purchase money resulting trust or otherwise.

       With the undisputed evidence showing a voluntary, intentional, and deliberate gift of the property by the husband to the wife, who had no knowledge of the transaction, and made no promise or agreement to hold the property for the husband, such gift cannot be cut down to an implied or resulting trust by events subsequently transpiring; and therefore, the declarations of the wife, after she had knowledge of the deed, as to the ownership of the property, and the payment of taxes and the making of improvements on the property by the husband, are insufficient to establish a resulting trust.

       - Husband who, in order to delay or defeat the collection of a claim for alimony or other lawful demands against him, conveyed land to another person and put that person in possession, could not maintain against the latter an action for the breach of a bond given by him to reconvey the land whenever so required.

       - When a husband pays the purchase money of land from his own funds and has the land conveyed to his wife, the presumption which the law makes is that the husband intended to make a gift to his wife; but the presumption is a rebuttable one, and a resulting trust in favor of the husband may be shown.

       If a husband buys and pays for land, and takes a deed in his wife's name, a presumption arises that he intends to make an absolute gift to her; and in order to overcome this presumption he must show something which raises an obligation in her to hold the property in trust for him. An absolute gift cannot, by events transpiring after it is made, be metamorphosed into a trust. Williams v.

       When a husband pays the purchase money of land from his own funds and has the land conveyed to his wife, the presumption which the law makes is that the husband intended to make a gift to his wife; but the presumption is a rebuttable one, and a resulting trust in favor of the husband may be shown. Parol evidence of the nature of the transaction, or the circumstances, or the conduct of the parties, is admissible to rebut the presumption of a gift; but in order to rebut the presumption of a gift the proof must be clear and convincing. Williams v. Thomas, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 767</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 603</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

       Resulting trust, as between husband and wife where the husband pays the purchase money and title is taken in the name of the wife, rests upon the intention of the parties at the time of the transaction, with the presumption being that the transaction was a gift. Parol proof of conduct, circumstances, and declarations is admissible as tending to show the intent of the parties; and such evidence might ordinarily, if sufficiently clear and convincing, authorize a jury to find that the intention of the parties was that the conveyance should be in trust and not a gift. But when the undisputed testimony of the husband, who seeks to establish the trust, shows a deliberate and intentional gift, such gift cannot be cut down to a trust by proof of subsequent events. Williams v. Thomas, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 767</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 603</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933,

       In a divorce, when a husband transferred the marital home to the wife for "love and affection" to protect the home from possible future creditors, and claimed that this created an implied resulting trust under which the wife held the home for the husband, he did not overcome the presumption that this was a gift, under former O.C.G.A.

      Presumption established by statute may be repelled by evidence showing that the husband thereafter exercised acts of dominion over the property of such a character as were inconsistent with ownership by the wife. Acts of the wife apparently recognizing ownership in the husband are proper matters for consideration in determining whether there has been an acceptance of the gift. Ashbaugh v.

      If a mother buys lands with her own funds and causes the title to be made to her son under an understanding and agreement that the property is to be hers, and that the son will make to her such conveyance as she may require, a trust in favor of the mother will be implied.

       - Debtor held any post-bankruptcy petition payment that the debtor might receive on the debtor's retirement benefit in constructive trust for the debtor's ex-spouse to the extent of one half of such net benefit, since established principles of equity would not allow the debtor to be unjustly enriched at the ex-spouse's expense by discharging in bankruptcy an interest in a benefit established by a final divorce decree.

       - Guardian cannot, either directly or indirectly, buy property of the guardian's ward at a sale thereof by some other person or authority, as a creditor of the ward selling at public auction under a power of sale. If the guardian does by such means acquire the legal title to property of the guardian's ward, the guardian will be deemed a trustee as to such property at the election of the ward or the ward's heirs at law. Allen v. Wade, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 753</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 538</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       If, after appointment of one as guardian of another's property, one buys a tax claim against one's ward's estate, as by obtaining a deed to oneself from a county conveying land which the county had previously purchased as the property of the ward at a tax sale, one will be treated in equity as holding under such deed as trustee for one's ward.

       - When one by a trick, or a fraud, or other wrongful act, obtained money from the trustee of the victim, one was, unless one had some other or better right thereto, an involuntary trustee of the thing gained for the benefit of the person who would have otherwise had the thing.

       When defendant obtained money by fraud and trickery ("the telegram racket") in order to prevent the defendant from taking advantage of defendant's own wrong, a naked, constructive, ex maleficio trust would be imposed by operation of law upon the property thus obtained even though it was contrary to the defendant's intention and will, and the defendant became a trustee ex maleficio for such property; the defendant was trustee ex maleficio of a naked ex maleficio trust, which required no action on the defendant's part beyond the turning over or returning of the money to the beneficiary, the victim.

       - When land is purchased by one with the money of others, under an agreement and understanding that title is to be taken in the name of all, and the one procures a deed to the land but causes the deed to be made to oneself alone, an implied trust will arise in favor of the others as to an undivided interest in the land.

       Evidence supported a finding that the life insurance funds from the deaths of a daughter's parents in the hands of the daughter's grandmother were subject to a constructive trust since the insurance company paid the funds to the grandfather based on the acquiescence of the daughter's uncle, who was the administrator of the parents' estates, and the assertion that the parents' deaths were simultaneous, which acquiescence, in light of the contrary evidence and in light of the uncle's own conclusion that the mother died first, was a breach of the uncle's fiduciary duties owed to the daughter; the evidence showed that the grandfather would have been unjustly enriched by retaining those insurance funds that should have been paid to the daughter through the estates; receiving the proceeds under the grandfather's will, the grandmother was also not an innocent purchaser and therefore took title to the proceeds subject to the trust impressed upon them.

        <p>
       - In all cases when a trust is sought to be implied, parol evidence of the nature of the transaction, or the circumstances, or the conduct of the parties, is admissible either to imply or rebut a trust. Stern v. Howell, <cite class="ga_court">160 Ga. 261</cite>, <cite class="app_court">127 S.E. 776</cite> (1925) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If from all the facts and circumstances an implied trust is otherwise established, it is not destroyed by the express verbal agreement which may have constituted a part of the transaction. The express agreement may be shown, not as fixing the interest to be owned by the parties, but as rebutting the inference of a gift by the plaintiff. Hudson v. Evans, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">32 S.E.2d 793</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - An instrument relied upon as creating an implied trust must show facts from which it may be ascertained that legal title to the property is in one person and the beneficial interest in another. West v. Downer, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">127 S.E.2d 359</cite> (1962) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       Conduct and declarations of the parties subsequent to the transfer, which are consistent with an agreement to hold the property for the benefit of another, may be evidence of a constructive trust.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - An implied trust reflecting the true intentions of the parties may be established by parol evidence, although the effect of such evidence is to alter or vary a written instrument. In re Gaites, 466 F. Supp. 248 (M.D. Ga. 1979) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-106).

        <p>

        Trial court did not err in allowing parol evidence to establish an implied trust
       
       in favor of the grantor, notwithstanding the warranty deed from the grantor to the grantor's brother, since it was agreed the grantor would continue residing in the house for the grantor's lifetime upon payment of taxes and insurance. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga. App. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">346 S.E.2d 848</cite> (1986) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - Earmarking doctrine did not apply because there was no substitution of one creditor for another, and although the only written documentation of the loan was a promissory note, parol evidence could be used to determine if the loan created an implied trust.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Implied trusts are not within the statute of frauds, and the courts will hear parol evidence, showing the facts from which the trusts are sought to be implied. Alexander v. Alexander, <cite class="ga_court">46 Ga. 283</cite> (1872) (decided under former Code 1868,
   §§
   2290 and 2291); Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">150 Ga. 544</cite>, <cite class="app_court">104 S.E. 236</cite> (1920); Guffin v. Kelly, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 880</cite>, <cite class="app_court">14 S.E.2d 50</cite> (1941);(decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-108).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In all cases where a trust is sought to be implied, the court may hear parol evidence of the nature of the transaction, or the circumstances, or conduct of the parties, either to imply or rebut a trust. Hemphill v. Hemphill, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 585</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 878</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §§
   3732 and 3739).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While an express trust must be created by writing, and cannot be proved by parol, implied trusts may be established by parol evidence, although the effect of such evidence is to alter or vary a written instrument, and although the defendant sets up and insists upon the statute of frauds. Sykes v. Reeves, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 587</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 688</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        To engraft an implied trust upon an absolute deed by parol evidence,
       
       such evidence ought to be clear and satisfactory. Brown v. Leggitt, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 366</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E.2d 889</cite> (1970) (decided under former law); Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga. App. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">346 S.E.2d 848</cite> (1986);(decided under former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t53c12s53-12-34" target="_self">53-12-34</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Deed absolute in form may be shown by parol evidence to have been made in trust for the benefit of the grantor when the maker remains in possession of the land. Hall v. Turner, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 763</cite>, <cite class="app_court">32 S.E.2d 829</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   108-108).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An express trust cannot be made by parol agreement.
       
       Nor can an allegation of an express, oral trust be employed to defeat a resulting trust. Wells v. Wells, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 586</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933,

      The owners of property located in this state or persons desiring to acquire beneficial ownership of such property may create by deed an estate therein and in the improvements made thereon and in the property to be acquired, for the benefit of themselves and such other persons, whether sui juris or not, who may contribute to the improvement or development or acquisition of the property and their assigns or transferees, provided that the deed creating the estate shall provide for the improvement or development of the property covered thereby or for the acquisition of the property and the trustee therein named, and his or her successor shall have some active duty to perform in and about the trust property or the management or control of the same. The deed creating the estate shall be recorded as provided in Code Section 53-12-152. When such an estate is created, the legal title to the property and all the property added thereto or substituted therefor shall vest and remain in the trustee named and his or her successor, in accordance with the terms of the deed, with all the powers conferred thereby upon the trustee, and shall not during the continuance of the estate pass to or vest in the beneficiaries. At the end of 25 years from the date of the deed creating the estate, the title to such of the property as may then belong to the estate shall vest in the beneficiaries; and, if the deed creating the estate so provides, a renewal of the estate may be made at the end of the 25 years, upon the terms and conditions and in the manner therein set forth, for a like period; provided, however, that in the alternative to the period of 25 years and the renewal thereof, if the deed so provides, the estate may be created for any period of time specified therein which does not extend beyond any number of lives in being and 21 years thereafter.

The trustee or person in charge of the estate representing the trustee shall be subject to the same demand as that provided by Code Sections 9-13-58 and 11-8-112 for the levying officer to make upon the officers of a corporation. Persons having claims against the estate may enforce the same by action against the trustee thereof in like manner as actions against corporations, and service thereof may be perfected by serving the trustee, if a resident of this state, and if not, then by publication. The venue of such actions shall be the same as that of similar actions against private corporations, but neither the trustee nor the beneficiaries of the estate shall be personally or individually liable therefor except in cases where officers and stockholders of private corporations would be liable under the law.

       Hospital is not, any more than a drugstore, a charitable institution per se;

      While a hospital is not per se a subject of charity, and it depends upon the service given as to whether or not it is a subject of charity within the meaning thereof, nevertheless a devise "to the Masonic Hospital of Georgia, for tubercular children" is a charitable bequest within the meaning of the statute.

       Test which determines whether a hospital is charitable
      
      or otherwise is the hospital's purpose, that is, whether the hospital is maintained for gain, profit, or advantage, or not; and the question of whether a hospital is maintained for the purpose of charity or for that of profit is to be determined, in case the hospital is incorporated, not only from the hospital's powers as defined in the hospital's charter, but also from the manner in which the hospital is conducted.

      Hospital is not per se a subject of charity; whether a hospital is such subject of charity depends on requirement of hospital service rendered for relief of human suffering as related to the poor, and to be free of charge where there is inability to pay. When such is the purpose and the hospital operates in pursuance of that purpose, it is a subject of charity within the meaning of the law. Taylor v.

      When the finding was authorized that hospital owned and maintained by the City of Augusta, commonly known as the "University Hospital of Augusta, Georgia," and thus designated in the will in question, was a charitable institution, owned by the city and maintained primarily for the gratuitous treatment of the sick and needy of the city and county, and that by that item the testator intended the estate therein bequeathed to be applied to the promotion of the charitable objects of such hospital, the charitable bequest, being valid, would be given effect.

      When residuary bequest, construed in connection with all the items of the will and the statutory law showed the intent of the testator to require hospital service free of charge to poor people who were unable to pay, the proposed hospital was a proper subject of charity within the meaning of the law, and this result was not altered because of the further intent to charge persons able to pay, since the receipts from that service were to be devoted to maintenance or improvement of the hospital, with no element of private gain.

       - As a general rule, the doctrine of cy pres is applied in cases: (1) where there is the presence of an otherwise valid charitable grant or trust, that is, one that has charity as its purpose and sufficiently offers benefits to an indefinite public; (2) where the specific intention of the settlor may not be legally or practicably carried into effect; and (3) where there is exhibited a general charitable intent on the part of the settlor. Trammell v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 841</cite>, <cite class="app_court">199 S.E.2d 194</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When it was apparent from entire will and codicil that bequest to the governing authorities of a named association, "same being an Orphan's Home located at Macon, Georgia," was intended as a charitable trust for the benefit of orphans as a class, and that the designated "governing authorities" were merely to perform the office of trustee, the bequest was sufficiently definite and specific to be capable of execution, and since a trust will not fail for the want of a trustee, the legacy would not lapse merely because there may have been no such orphan's home and "governing authorities" as were mentioned in the will; in such case a court of equity could, by approximation, effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator in a manner most similar to that indicated by the testator.

       - Fact that a religious, charitable, or educational organization named as a beneficiary in a will discontinues its active functions after the execution of the will does not impair its right to take the gift so long as its identity, whether corporate or associative, continues without dissolution until the death of the testator.

        Doctrine of cy pres cannot be applied to establish trust for entirely different purpose
       
       from that intended by testator. Evans v. Abney, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 826</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1968), aff'd, <cite class="us_code">396 U.S. 435</cite>, <cite class="s_court">90 S.

   §
   108-202).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Cy pres will not be applied when there is demonstrated an intention of the settlor contrary to the inference of general charitable intent that the property should be applied exclusively to the purpose which is or has become impracticable or illegal. Such demonstration of a specific intent of the settlor as would result in a failure of the devise must be clear, definite, and unambiguous. In such event the trust will fail, and a resulting trust will be implied for the benefit of the testator or the testator's heirs. Trammell v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 841</cite>, <cite class="app_court">199 S.E.2d 194</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       When the accomplishment of the particular purpose and only that purpose was desired by the testator and the testator had no more general charitable intent and the testator would presumably have preferred to have the whole trust fail if the particular purpose is impossible of accomplishment, the cy pres doctrine is not applicable. Evans v. Abney, <cite class="us_code">396 U.S. 435</cite>, <cite class="s_court">90 S. Ct. 628</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">24 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 634 (1970) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court's application of cy pres doctrine to impose a constructive trust in a corporation's favor was error under circumstances in which the decedent improperly named the corporation as a payable on death beneficiary of certificates of deposit and a trust account because, while the trial court may have been able to apply the doctrine of cy pres to as nearly as possible effectuate the decedent's intentions by, for example, allowing the decedent's charitable gift to go to some authorized entity that served much the same function as the corporation, the trial court did not do that; the trial court specifically imposed a constructive trust in favor of the corporation on the financial instruments, and this was error. Indeed, the trial court's use of cy pres in a manner that would have effectuated a payment that expressly violated the law turned the doctrine of cy pres on its head. Tuvim v. United Jewish Cmtys., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">285 Ga. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">680 S.E.2d 827</cite> (2009) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       Special chancery (now equity) jurisdiction over charitable bequests
      
      grows out of rule that, in cases of private right, courts will not enforce uncertainties, and that the parties at interest must be capable of definite ascertainment; but it is of the very nature of a charity that this is impossible, and from the most ancient times courts of chancery in England have applied very different rules in determining the validity of charitable bequests from the rules applied to such as were not charitable. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

      <p>
       <p>
      When the framers of the Code declared the courts of chancery (now equity) to have jurisdiction to enforce charitable bequests, declared what were charities and recognized the doctrine of cy pres, the framers intended to say something more than that courts of equity could enforce trusts; there was no propriety in giving this special jurisdiction or in defining charitable purposes if a bequest for charitable purposes, to be valid, must have the same certainty and definiteness as to its objects and mode of division, as bequests, not for charitable purposes.

       - Resignation of the assignee of a trust arising under general assignments for the benefit of creditors was not a revocation of the deed of assignment. The title having passed into the trustee, the trust should not be allowed to fail for the want of a trustee. A successor will be appointed. McFerran, Shallcross &amp; Co. v.

       Trust for the maintenance of a school will not fail because of the failure of trustees; and when the office is vacant with no provision for appointments the superior court sitting in equity upon petition by the beneficiaries will make the appointment. Thompson v. Hale, <cite class="ga_court">123 Ga. 305</cite>, <cite class="app_court">51 S.E. 383</cite> (1905) (decided under former Code 1895,

       When a deed creating a religious and educational trust provides that successive trustees shall be appointed by proper authorities, when the office becomes vacant, the trust will not fail because of there being no trustee but a court of equity will appoint one.

       When it was apparent from entire will and codicil that bequest to the governing authorities of a named association, "same being an Orphan's Home located at Macon, Georgia," was intended as a charitable trust for the benefit of orphans as a class, and that the designated "governing authorities" were merely to perform the office of trustee, the bequest was sufficiently definite and specific to be capable of execution, and since a trust will not fail for the want of a trustee, the legacy would not lapse merely because there may have been no such orphan's home and "governing authorities" as were mentioned in the will; in such case a court of equity could, by approximation, effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator in a manner most similar to that indicated by the testator. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 684</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the manifest intention was to create a charitable trust for tubercular children, even though the charitable institution named never existed, the purpose and object for which the trust was created still exists and the legacy does not lapse, and the cy pres doctrine applies.

       If a gift is made for a public charitable purpose, it is immaterial that the trustee is uncertain or incapable of taking, or that the objects of the charity are uncertain and indefinite. It will, nevertheless, be sustained. Roughton v. Jones, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 774</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - When a will creates a trust estate, imposing upon the executor the additional duty to hold the legal title until the death of the daughter, the trust continues until the trust is fully executed by a sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds according to the terms of the will. In such case the superior court is empowered, after the death of the executor trustee, to appoint a new trustee in the place of such deceased. Sanders v. Hinton, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 812</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       - It matters not how large the number of beneficiaries may be; the petition of two of the beneficiaries is sufficient in this respect to bring the petition within the jurisdiction of the superior court. Sanders v. Hinton, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 812</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       All of the beneficiaries stand alike and have equal rights not only in the division of the proceeds arising from a sale of the property, but as to the forum in which the application for the appointment of a trustee should be made. The proceeding may be had as well in the county of the residence of the testator, and where the trust property is located, as in the county of the residence of the nonpetitioning beneficiaries. Sanders v. Hinton, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 812</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        Power and authority of superior courts to appoint new trustees
       
       when the sole or surviving trustee has become disqualified in some manner cannot be exercised when the trust instrument provides the method of appointment of successors unless some reason appears that the method provided by the trust instrument cannot be followed.

       - Trial court had to look to trust instrument to determine how a vacancy in position of trustee was to be filled as the law directed the trial court to start there in determining how to fill that position after the settlor and a trustee died, and the two successor co-trustees resigned before the trustee died, leaving the trust unrepresented.
   Thus, a trial court was authorized to allow the trust's beneficiaries to be appointed as successor trustees as the law allowed interested parties to petition and be appointed as trustees, especially since the law did not limit the number of successor trustees it could appoint and appointment of the successor trustees was neither inconsistent with the settlor's intentions nor the interests of the beneficiaries.

       - When a person as next friend filed a bill to set up equity in property and was decreed to be a trustee with the title vested in the trustee as trustee for the wife and children, this amounted to an acceptance of the trust by the trustee; and if there was no renunciation of the trust, the trustee continued to be the trustee for the children, and if the trustee failed to act when the trustee should have done so, the trustee is liable to the children for the trustee's nonaction. Salter v. Salter, <cite class="ga_court">80 Ga. 178</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E. 391</cite>, <cite class="am_st_r">12 Am. St. R. 249</cite> (1887) (decided under former law).

       When one enters one's acceptance on the back of a deed appointing one trustee, one has accepted the trust and "no disclaimer will remove the character of trustee". New S.

       When one appointed trustee, with notice of the trust, voluntarily undertakes to discharge duties devolving upon the trustee, and interferes with the trust fund in such a manner and to such an extent as that one's interference therewith cannot be plainly referred to some other ground of action, one will be conclusively presumed to have accepted the trust. Freeman v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">115 Ga. 23</cite>, <cite class="app_court">41 S.E. 385</cite> (1902) (decided under former law).

       - Trial court did not err in granting a settlor summary judgment on his son's claim regarding the son's removal as a co-trustee because before his removal as trustee, the son refused to sign legal documents after verbally promising to do so, he placed his girlfriend on the company payroll, and he threatened to sue his siblings; that evidence gave the settlor what the trust instrument described as "reasonable cause" to remove the son.

       - Trial court erred in concluding that a widow's considerable powers of control over two trusts entitled her to summary judgment on two of the children's/beneficiaries' claims against the trust created for the purpose of supporting them during their lifetimes; she was required to diligently and in good faith ascertain whether they required support, and her powers over the assets did not entitle her to commit waste.

       - Trial court did not err when the court granted the trustees summary judgment on the son's claims for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty because there was no evidence of bad faith, and, therefore, judicial intervention into the trustees' consistent decisions to treat all beneficiaries, including themselves, equally in the form of per stirpes distributions was not authorized; the son produced no evidence that the trustees ignored the beneficiaries' means of support, but even if the trustees had done so, the trustees could, in the trustees' discretion, exclude the beneficiaries' resources from their consideration on the basis of both: (i) the trust instrument's grant to distribute either equal or unequal amounts to each of the settlor's children; and (ii) the trustees' personal knowledge concerning the settlor's intended treatment of the children.

       - Trial court erred in concluding that a widow's considerable powers of control over two testamentary trusts as trustee and executor entitled her to summary judgment on two of the children's/beneficiaries' claims against the trust created for the purpose of supporting them during their lifetimes; she was required to diligently and in good faith ascertain whether they required support, and her powers over the assets did not entitle her to commit waste.

       - In a breach of trust action, the trial court did not apply an incorrect standard of care in that a co-trustee could only be held liable if the co-trustee failed to act in good faith because if there was any error, the error was created by the co-trustee since the co-trustee consented to the instructions given and failed to request a charge that clearly set forth what the co-trustee asserted to be the proper standard for acts performed with absolute discretion.

       - It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a new trial motion brought by a trustee who was found to have breached the trustee's fiduciary duty to trust beneficiaries by making distributions to a co-trustee under a trust's encroachment provision because the trustee breached the trustee's duty to protect the trust corpus as: (1) the trustee inconsistently required the co-trustee to provide supporting evidence for corpus distributions and let the co-trustee exceed an allotted budget; and (2) the beneficiaries were damaged by the resulting reduction in trust corpus.

       - In a trust beneficiary's action against a co-trustee and others, issues of fact remained as to the beneficiary's claims for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of a trust asset for less than fair market value and failure to account for a commission owed on the sale, rendering summary judgment on these claims improper.

        <p>
       In a beneficiary's claims against a trustee and the trust's attorneys, issues of fact remained as to the trustee's and attorneys' duties surrounding the sale of the trust's cattle ranch at auction because no appraisal was done, the sale was only run for seven weeks, the trustee believed the land was worth more than the price obtained, and the trustee failed to consider a commission due to a real estate agent.

       - Because there were genuine issues as to whether trustees fraudulently concealed their breach of fiduciary duty in selling the principal trust asset to a co-trustee at a discount through a straw man in 1979, tolling the statute of limitations, and whether the beneficiaries exercised diligence in discovering the fraud, summary judgment was improper.

       - When, in a divorce case, the jury clearly intended to create a trust for the purpose of providing support for the minor child during the child's minority and also intended that there be monthly payments from the trust for the use of the child, but the husband failed to take any substantive steps to set up the trust, there was no error in the trial court naming a trustee and effectuating the trust by requiring the husband to make the payments necessary to uphold the husband's share of the debts, encumbrances, and maintenance of the trust property.

       While it is the rule that a bona fide purchaser of property in which trust funds have been invested is protected, the beneficiary of a trust estate may at the beneficiary's option, within a reasonable time, "affirm or reject an unauthorized investment by the trustee," and equity will aid the beneficiary in recovering the funds or property, or enforcing a lien for the wrongfully used funds, provided that the assets can be traced and remain in the hands of a person "affected with notice of the misapplication."

       - When trustee deposits money in bank, bank has the right to assume that the money so deposited will be applied by the trustee to proper purposes under the trust; and, acting under this assumption, the bank may lawfully pay the checks drawn by the person depositing the money, whether signed in the person's representative capacity or not.

        As regards establishment of debt due by estate, defendant legatees stand in place of executor.
       
       Thus, the action is not governed by the limitations in reference to actions for money had and received or unjust enrichment, but by the limitations to actions on the character of the claim against the estate.

       Creditor can follow assets into the hands of a distributee, with proper pleadings for that purpose, as well in a court of law as in a court of equity, but if the creditor elects to proceed in the former court, the creditor must allege and prove the same substantial facts as would be required to entitle the creditor to relief in the latter. As to requisite facts, see Scranton v. Demere, <cite class="ga_court">6 Ga. 92</cite> (1849) (decided under former law); Caldwell v.

        If it be true, as alleged, that H conveyed to M H's interest in a railroad company to enable the latter to build a railroad, and if instead of building the railroad its entire franchise and all its holdings were conveyed by a void contract to another corporation, it is optional with H to proceed against M for the breach of their undertaking, or to pursue and attempt the recaption of the property itself.

       - If a bank actively aids the trustee in misappropriating the fund, and especially if the bank participates in the misappropriation and receives the fruits of such misappropriation by obtaining payment of a debt due the bank by the trustee in one's individual capacity, the bank would be liable to the true owners of the fund for the amount thus wrongfully appropriated by the bank to the bank's own uses. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 4</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 803</cite> (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §§
   3595 and 4521).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a trustee deposits money in a bank, the bank has a right to assume that the money so deposited will be applied by the trustee to the proper purposes under the trust; and, acting under this assumption, the bank may lawfully pay the checks drawn by the person depositing the money, whether signed in one's representative capacity or not. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 4</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 803</cite> (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       When the absolute title to property is apparently in a vendor or mortgagor, the vendee or mortgagee is protected, unless the one seeking to set up a lien or trust against the property can show that the vendee or mortgagee had notice of trust funds having gone into the property. Tattnall Bank v. Harvey, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 752</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 724</cite> (1938) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       Mere fact that purchaser might have had some knowledge of a mingling by one's vendor of trust funds with one's own is not sufficient to charge the vendee with notice that trust funds had been diverted in the purchase of a particular piece of land.

       Because no verdict form presented the jury with the question of whether the siblings who sold their deceased mother's farm to another sibling had breached a fiduciary duty, a trial court erred in granting attorney's fees to the other siblings who sued over the purchase, as an award of fees under former O.C.G.A.

       - Jury question was presented as to whether two trustees of their children's trusts acted against the interests of the beneficiaries (their children) in bad faith by amending a partnership agreement to concentrate all voting power in themselves to the exclusion of the beneficiaries, who otherwise would have become partners when they turned 45.

       Beneficiaries' breach of fiduciary duty claim against the trustee of a family trust was time-barred because: (1) the statute began to run when the trustee entered into a loan transaction that allegedly harmed the trust; (2) the beneficiaries did not show the trustee withheld information from the beneficiaries, deterred the beneficiaries from hiring the beneficiaries' own advisor to review the loan, or deterred the beneficiaries from timely filing suit; and (3) the beneficiaries raised no fact issue as to whether the beneficiaries used diligence to discover any fraud that would toll the statute.

        Trustee shall not incur any individual or personal liability
       
       in such action. On the contrary, the statute expressly declares: "The judgment thus rendered shall impose no personal liability on the trustee," etc. It will therefore be seen that one is a mere nominal party, so far as personal interest in the action is concerned, charged with the duty of defending the action, not in one's own behalf, but on behalf of the cestuis que trust. If one fails properly to discharge this duty, one is liable to them in damages. Wagnon v. Pease, <cite class="ga_court">104 Ga. 417</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E. 895</cite> (1898) (decided under former Code 1895,
   §
   3203). Vason &amp; Davis v. Gardner, <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 517</cite> (1883) See also.

        <p>
       - In an action by beneficiaries of a trust to recover on a promissory note, the trial court did not err in limiting their potential counterclaim liability to the amount the beneficiaries would otherwise have received as trust beneficiaries since the beneficiaries could not be held personally liable in an action against the trust.

       - Insurer did not have a duty to defend a trustee as the real estate at issue was conveyed to the purchasers by another individual acting as attorney-in-fact for the trustee in the trustee's role as trustee, and the trustee did not allege the trustee had any interaction with the purchasers that would have created personal liability under state law, former O.C.G.A.

      If a trustee determines that an allocation between principal and income required by Code Sections 53-12-425 through 53-12-428 or Code Section 53-12-431 is insubstantial, the trustee may allocate the entire amount to principal unless one of the circumstances described in Code Section 53-12-361 applies to the allocation. Such power may be exercised by a cotrustee in the circumstances described in Code Section 53-12-361 and may be released for the reasons and in the manner described in such Code section. An allocation shall be presumed to be insubstantial if:
