       Ga. L. 2016, p. 257,
   §
   1/SB 319, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds that the mental health and wellness needs of Georgia's citizens require the availability of trained mental health professionals who can accurately diagnose, treat, prescribe, and appropriately assess the mental and emotional illnesses, disorders, and conditions from which they suffer and the vocational, educational, interpersonal, and intrapersonal needs essential to living and learning how to live productive and useful lives. It is the intent of the General Assembly to assure geographical and financial access for all of Georgia's citizens to excellent mental health services to the extent that Georgia's resources and regulations permit. To these ends, Georgia regulates its licensed psychiatrists, psychologists, professional counselors, marriage and family therapists, and clinical social workers who provide graduate level professional services to Georgia's private and public mental health services and to its public mental health, educational, and vocational support systems. The General Assembly seeks in such regulatory process to protect the public and assure it receives high quality and appropriate services and to define the scopes of practice and diagnostic authority for each of these professional groups consistent with the graduate level training and supervision, or its equivalent, that the members of each profession have sought and successfully completed. The General Assembly has empowered and authorized the Georgia Composite Medical Board, the State Board of Examiners of Psychologists, and the Georgia Composite Board of Professional Counselors, Social Workers, and Marriage and Family Therapists to fulfill these responsibilities and expects them to work together to assure a continuum of professional services that ensure appropriate diagnostic and assessment functions for each profession and the psychotherapeutic and counseling treatment services appropriate to each profession. The General Assembly recognizes that advances in medicine, science, education, training, and service delivery occur constantly in our modern history and therefore also expects the regulatory boards for each profession to assure that its licensees seek and successfully complete appropriate continuing education and training for the functions and services authorized to each profession."

       The General Assembly finds that the state has a need to continually improve its system for providing effective, efficient, and quality mental health, developmental disability, and addictive disease services. Further, the General Assembly finds that a comprehensive range of quality services and opportunities is vitally important to the existence and well-being of individuals with mental health, developmental disability, or addictive disease needs and their families. The General Assembly further finds that the state has an obligation and a responsibility to develop and implement planning and service delivery systems which focus on a core set of consumer oriented, community based values and principles which include, but are not limited to, the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a1">
         Consumers and families should have choices about services and providers and should have substantive input into the planning and delivery of all services;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a2">
         A single point of accountability should exist for fiscal, service, and administrative issues to ensure better coordination of services among all programs and providers and to promote cost-effective, efficient service delivery and administration;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a3">
         The system should be appropriately comprehensive and adaptive to allow consumers and their families to access the services they desire and need;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a4">
         Public programs are the foundation of the service planning and delivery system and they should be valued and nurtured; at the same time, while assuring comparable standards of quality, private sector involvement should be increased to allow for expanded consumer choice and improved cost effectiveness;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a5">
         Planning should begin at the local level and include local government, consumers, families, advocates, and other interested local parties;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a6">
         The system should ensure that the needs of consumers who are most in need are met at the appropriate service levels; at the same time, prevention strategies should be emphasized for those disabilities which are known to be preventable;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a7">
         The system should be designed to provide the highest quality of services utilizing flexibility in funding, incentives, and outcome evaluation techniques which reinforce quality, accountability, efficiency, and consumer satisfaction;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a8">
         The functions of service planning, coordination, contracting, resource allocation, and consumer assessment should be separated from the actual treatment, habilitation, and prevention services provided by contractors;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a9">
         Consumers and families should have a single, community based point of entry into the system;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a10">
         Consumers, staff, providers, and regional planning board and community service board members should receive ongoing training and education and should have access to key management resources such as information systems and technical and professional support services; and
        </li>
        <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1a11">
         The department is responsible for ensuring the appropriate use of state, federal, and other funds to provide quality services for individuals with mental health, developmental disabilities, or addictive disease needs who are served by the public system and to protect consumers of these services from abuse and maltreatment.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t37c01s37-1-2ol1b">
       Local governments, specifically county governing authorities, have provided outstanding leadership and support for mental health, developmental disability, and addictive disease programs, and the General Assembly finds that their investments, both personal and capital, should be valued and utilized in any improved system. As such, the state and any new governing structure should take special precautions to ensure that the county governing authorities have an expanded level of input into decision making and resource allocation and that any services or programs should continue to use and expand their use of county facilities and resources wherever appropriate and possible.

         Sovereign immunity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Considering the public purpose for which the boards were created, a community service board is a "state department or agency" entitled to raise the defense of sovereign immunity under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Par. IX. Youngblood v. Gwinnett Rockdale Newton Cmty. Serv. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">273 Ga. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">545 S.E.2d 875</cite> (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because community service boards are agencies or departments of the state, accordingly, the legislature acted unconstitutionally when the legislature ignored Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Par. IX(e) and the express terms of the Georgia Tort Claims Act, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.50.html#t50c21s50-21-20" target="_blank">50-21-20</a></cite> et seq., by enacting O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-11.1ol1c1" target="_self">37-2-11.1(c)(1)</a></cite> so as to denominate these newly-created state agencies or departments as unclassified public entities to be accorded the same immunity as counties. Youngblood v. Gwinnett Rockdale Newton Cmty. Serv. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">273 Ga. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">545 S.E.2d 875</cite> (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Limited sovereign immunity waiver was subject to a specific exception for assault or battery, and in determining whether this exception applied, it was not necessary that the act have been committed by a state officer or employee. A community service board was a state agency and was immune from a claim arising from the stabbing death of a resident at a community home run by the board. Oconee Cmty. Serv. Bd. v. Holsey, <cite class="ga_app_court">266 Ga. App. 385</cite>, <cite class="app_court">597 S.E.2d 489</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Community service board (CSB) was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity against a former employee's Americans with Disabilities Act claims because: (1) for the purpose of litigation, the Georgia General Assembly in O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-11.1ol1c1" target="_self">37-2-11.1(c)(1)</a></cite> defined a CSB as being akin to a county, which was not an arm of the state entitled to immunity; and (2) when it came to debt and liability, a CSB was autonomous pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-6ol1a" target="_self">37-2-6(a)</a></cite>; although other factors cut in favor of CSB entitlement to Eleventh Amendment immunity, including the state's exercise of some control over a CSB pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-10ol1b" target="_self">37-2-10(b)</a></cite> and a CSB partial state funding, such factors were afforded less weight by the court. Johnson v. Ogeechee Behavioral Health Servs., 479 F. Supp. 2d 1357 (S.D. Ga. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-11.1" target="_self">37-2-11.1</a></cite> stated community service boards (CSB) were not agencies of the state or any specific county and that the boards had the same immunity as counties and counties were not arms of the state and did not have Eleventh Amendment immunity, the defendant, a CSB former employer, was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on a plaintiff former employee's discrimination claim; it was noted that counties had significant control over the policy and decisions made by CSB in that counties appoint board members under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-6ol1b" target="_self">37-2-6(b)</a></cite> and the counties served could allow CSB to privatize or join the county government under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-6.4ol1a" target="_self">37-2-6.4(a)</a></cite>, which was especially cogent, because it meant CSB, without state approval, could take itself outside of the state's control, and under O.C.G.A.

       - When the community service board filed a declaratory judgment action against the board's former executive director, contending that the director's contract violated public policy and that the director was not entitled to payment and benefits for various reasons, and the director counterclaimed against the board, the trial court did not err in ruling in favor of the director because the board's broad powers encompassed all of the benefits paid to the director, and it did not show that any of the director's benefits fell outside of the provisions of the enabling legislation; the director was entitled to payment for any compensation related to performance already rendered; and the director's post-retirement benefits were not gratuities.

       - Because community service boards are agencies or departments of the state, accordingly, the legislature acted unconstitutionally when the legislature ignored Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Par. IX(e) and the express terms of the Georgia Tort Claims Act by enacting O.C.G.A.

       - When, in a personal injury action against an employee of a community service board as an individual, there was a factual issue as to the employment status, if it was decided that the employee was not a state employee but was a board employee at the time of the collision, then it was necessary to resolve whether the employee's actions arose from the use of a motor vehicle covered by an insurance policy.

       Employees of a county mental retardation center were not entitled to official immunity for ministerial acts performed in connection with their official duties. Washington v.

       Considering the public purpose for which the board was created, a community service board is a "state department or agency" entitled to raise the defense of sovereign immunity under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Par. IX. Youngblood v. Gwinnett Rockdale Newton Cmty. Serv. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">273 Ga. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">545 S.E.2d 875</cite> (2001).

        <p>
       Community service board (CSB) was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity against a former employee's Americans with Disabilities Act claims because: (1) for the purpose of litigation, the Georgia General Assembly, in O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-11.1ol1c1" target="_self">37-2-11.1(c)(1)</a></cite> defined a CSB as being akin to a county, which was not an arm of the state entitled to immunity; and (2) when it came to debt and liability, a CSB was autonomous pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-6ol1a" target="_self">37-2-6(a)</a></cite>; although other factors cut in favor of CSB entitlement to Eleventh Amendment immunity, including the state's exercise of some control over a CSB pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-10ol1b" target="_self">37-2-10(b)</a></cite> and a CSB partial state funding, such factors were afforded less weight by the court. Johnson v. Ogeechee Behavioral Health Servs., 479 F. Supp. 2d 1357 (S.D. Ga. 2007).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-11.1" target="_self">37-2-11.1</a></cite> stated community service boards (CSB) were not agencies of the state or any specific county and that the boards had the same immunity as counties and counties were not arms of the state and did not have Eleventh Amendment immunity, the defendant, a CSB former employer, was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on a plaintiff former employee's discrimination claim.

       - When the patient was a voluntary outpatient, the psychiatrist had no control of the patient in the sense that the psychiatrist could claim legal authority to confine or restrain the patient against the patient's will unless the patient met the criteria for involuntary commitment set forth in O.C.G.A.

       - When the physician's testimony in a release hearing shows only that the defendant did not engage in aggressive, psychotic behavior and was not mentally ill during the defendant's stay at the hospital while in a structured environment, and in view of defendant's medical history, the history of the defendant's functioning in society, and the history of the case, all of which are facts which the trial court is authorized to consider, the court was authorized to find that the criteria for civil commitment had been met.

Such prior orders of hospitalization entered by the courts, unless superseded at an earlier date by an order under this chapter or unless such prior orders expire under their own terms at an earlier date, shall remain valid until March 1, 1979, after which all such orders shall be null and void and of no effect.

       - State's policy of discharging a voluntary patient who has a legal guardian or affording the patient an involuntary commitment hearing only upon the request of the patient's guardian deprives the patient of the patient's right to challenge the patient's confinement and violates due process. Heichelbech v. Evans, 798 F. Supp. 708 (M.D. Ga. 1992), aff'd, 995 F.2d 237 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">510 U.S. 947</cite>, <cite class="s_court">114 S.

       Distinguishing between voluntary patients with legal guardians and those without in the state's procedure for discharge from a state mental hospital does not violate equal protection since there is a rational basis for the distinction.

      Any involuntary patient may apply to be transferred to voluntary status of hospitalization and shall be so transferred if he is able to understand and exercise the rights and powers of a voluntary patient unless the chief medical officer finds that this would not be in the best interest of the patient, which finding shall be entered in the patient's clinical record and signed by the chief medical officer. In any case in which such transfer to voluntary status occurs and in any case in which a patient transferred to voluntary status is discharged, notice of such transfer or discharge, as the case may be, shall be given: to the patient and his representatives; if the patient's hospitalization was ordered by the court, to the court which entered such order; if the patient was admitted to a facility under subsection (a) of Code Section 37-3-41, to the physician or psychologist executing the certificate; and, if the patient was under criminal charges, of which the facility received written notification, by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the law enforcement agency originally having custody of the patient. An involuntary patient transferred to voluntary status, which patient is under criminal charges, notice of which charges have been given in writing to the facility, may only be discharged into the physical custody of the law enforcement agency originally having custody of the patient. Such agency shall assume such custody within five days after the mailing of notification to the agency pursuant to this Code section.

       - When one is held in custody pursuant to a void or defective physician's certificate, there is a viable claim for false imprisonment, but only if the certificate was not issued in "good faith."

         "False imprisonment" at mental hospital involves a medical question.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Although action was one for false imprisonment, the standard to determine whether or not the plaintiff was unlawfully detained by institutionalization at a mental hospital was a medical one; therefore, the court looked to cases involving medical malpractice in determining whether or not the defendant exercised reasonable medical care in diagnosing the plaintiff's mental condition and whether the defendant acted properly based upon that diagnosis.

       - Defendant's undisputed expert medical testimony that the defendant exercised proper medical care in rendering the defendant's diagnosis and utilized proper legal procedures in effectuating transfer of plaintiff patient to Georgia Regional Hospital supported grant of partial summary judgment in defendant's favor as to the issue of false imprisonment.

       - Defendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was properly denied as the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of two misdemeanor counts of obstructing a law enforcement officer because there was ample testimony about the existence and purpose of the order pursuant to which they assisted the deputies in taking the defendant into custody for transport to a mental health facility; the defendant refused to comply with the officers' verbal commands, and began fighting with the officers when the officers tried to detain the defendant; the defendant hit, kicked, and scratched the officers; and the officers and the defendant fell to the ground, and the defendant continued fighting until the officers were able to gain control of the defendant.

       - When a person has been adjudged insane and committed to an institution, and thereafter seeks to be discharged upon the ground that the person's sanity has been restored, the person cannot invoke the writ of habeas corpus without showing that the person has exhausted specific statutory remedies, when such are provided; however, a party might, perhaps, show some valid reason excusing failure to pursue a statutory remedy, even in a case when ordinarily the party should pursue the remedy.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the defendant in a release hearing had been examined three separate times to determine mental competency in relation to a criminal trial, and there had been a judicial determination that the defendant was not mentally responsible for the defendant's crimes and apparently not competent to stand trial, there existed a continuing presumption of insanity at the time of the release hearing.

         Determination of mental illness limited and summary proceedings.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Jurisdiction of the ordinary (now probate judge) in issuing a commission to examine a person as to mental illness, competency, or the management of one's estate is limited; the proceedings are summary, and should be strictly construed. Proceedings must show on their face all facts essential to the ordinary's (now probate judge's) jurisdiction and strict compliance with statute. Trapnell v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">131 Ga. App. 254</cite>, <cite class="app_court">205 S.E.2d 875</cite> (1974).

        In finding for the government in an action brought by a wife
       
       after her husband shot her rendering her paraplegic, the court concluded that the wife failed to show that the alleged tortfeasor, a licensed social worker, had the requisite control over the husband to give rise to a legal duty as articulated by the Georgia Supreme Court in Bradley Center, Inc. v. Wessner, <cite class="ga_court">250 Ga. 199</cite> (1982); specifically, the court found that at no time did the husband meet the involuntary commitment standard under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c03s37-3-1" target="_self">37-3-1</a></cite>(9.1), and that even if the husband had exhibited the statutory conditions for involuntary confinement, the social worker alone could not have had him committed in accordance with O.C.G.A.

       - When the physician's testimony in a release hearing shows only that the defendant did not engage in aggressive, psychotic behavior and was not mentally ill during the defendant's stay at the hospital while in a structured environment, and in view of defendant's medical history, the history of the defendant's functioning in society, and the history of the case, all of which are facts which the trial court is authorized to consider, the trial court was authorized to find that the criteria for civil commitment have been met.

        <p>
       - Judgments by a court of ordinary (now probate court) ruling on mental competency or incompetency are judicial in nature and appealable to the superior court by the losing party. Tingle v. Harvill, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1972).

        <p>

        Procedure for determining competency seeks to protect the ward as well as the guardian
       
       and the members of the family who are required to receive notification by granting their full day in court including all appeals permitted in judicial proceedings. Tingle v. Harvill, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Guardian has the right of appeal to the superior court
       
       from an order of the court of ordinary (now probate court) restoring the ward to competency. Tingle v. Harvill, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1972).

        <p>

        Time for filing an appeal

       - Private hospital in which a patient is placed for treatment owes duty of safeguarding and protecting patient from any known or reasonably apprehended danger from the patient which may be due to the patient's mental incapacity, and to use ordinary and reasonable care to prevent such danger.

       It shall be the policy of this state to protect, within reason, the right of every individual to refuse medication except in cases where a physician determines that refusal would be unsafe to the patient or others. If the patient continues to refuse medication after such initial emergency treatment, a concurring opinion from a second physician must be obtained before medication can be continued without the patient's consent. Further, in connection with any hearing under this chapter, the patient has the right to appear and testify as free from any side effects or adverse effects of the medication as is reasonably possible.

       In cases of grave emergency where the medical staff of the facility in which a mentally ill individual has been accepted for treatment determines that immediate surgical or other intervention is necessary to prevent serious physical consequences or death and where delay in obtaining consent would create a grave danger to the physical health of such person, as determined by at least two physicians, then essential surgery or other intervention may be administered without the consent of the person, the spouse, next of kin, attorney, guardian, or any other person. In such cases, a record of the determination of the physicians shall be entered into the medical records of the patient and this will be proper consent for such surgery or other intervention. Such consent will be valid notwithstanding the type of admission of the patient and it shall also be valid whether or not the patient has been adjudged incompetent. This Code section is intended to apply to those individuals who, as a result of their advanced age, impaired thinking, or other disability, cannot reasonably understand the consequences of withholding consent to surgery or other intervention as contemplated by this Code section. Any hospital or any physician, agent, employee, or official who obtains consent or relies on such consent, as authorized by this Code section, and who acts in good faith and within the provisions of this chapter shall be immune from civil or criminal liability for his or her actions in connection with the obtaining of or the relying upon such consent; provided, however, that nothing in this Code section shall be construed to relieve any hospital or any physician, agent, employee, or official from liability for failing to meet the applicable standard of care in the provision of treatment to a patient. Actual notice of any action taken pursuant to this Code section shall be given to the patient and the spouse, next of kin, attorney, guardian, or representative of the patient as soon as practicably possible.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the patient, who was voluntarily confined, killed and wounded another, the trial court erred by denying the physicians' motions for summary judgment when, at the relevant time, the patient was an out-patient. The physicians had no control of the patient in the sense that the physician could claim legal authority to confine or restrain the patient against the patient's will unless the patient met the criteria for involuntary commitment. Additionally, there was no evidence from which one could conclude that the physicians knew or reasonably should have known that the patient was likely to cause bodily harm to oneself or to the victims.

        <p>
       - Trial court erred in granting the state's motion to involuntarily medicate the defendant in an attempt to make the defendant competent to stand trial because the defendant argued that the defendant had a statutory right to avoid involuntary medication; and, under the four-part Sell test (Sell v. United States, <cite class="us_code">539 U.S. 166</cite>, <cite class="s_court">123 S. Ct. 2174</cite>, 156 L. E. 2d 197 (2003)), the state failed to demonstrate that involuntarily medicating the defendant would significantly further important government interests and that the administration of the medication was medically appropriate for the defendant as the trial court failed to specify the anti-psychotic medication or the dosages that could be forcibly administered to the defendant.

In those cases in which the client will not or cannot appear, at least one member of the committee will make all reasonable efforts to interview the client and report to the committee. An updated individualized program plan for the client shall be presented to the committee. The committee shall report to the superintendent or regional state hospital administrator or his or her designee, other than the attending physician or a member of the committee, its written recommendations along with any minority recommendations which may also be submitted.

         Continuing presumption of insanity follows prior judicial determination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the defendant in a release hearing had been examined three separate times to determine mental competency in relation to a criminal trial, and there had been a judicial determination that the defendant not mentally responsible for the defendant's crimes and apparently not competent to stand trial, there existed a continuing presumption of insanity at the time of the release hearing. Pitts v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 691</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 435</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When prior determination based on clear and convincing evidence,
       
       as when the trial court had for the court's consideration the evidence of numerous prior committals for psychiatric treatment, evidence that following release from such structured treatment, the defendant had suffered decompensation and had often become violent and aggressive toward oneself or others when not undergoing a regular course of treatment and medication, even though the state did not affirmatively offer it or any additional evidence at the release hearing. Pitts v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 691</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 435</cite> (1979).

        Precepts of due process require a clear and convincing
       
       standard of proof in a civil proceeding to commit an individual to a mental hospital involuntarily. Pitts v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 691</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 435</cite> (1979).

If the client continues to refuse medication after such initial emergency treatment, a concurring opinion from a second physician must be obtained before medication can be continued without the client's consent.

In such cases, a record of the determination of the physicians shall be entered into the medical records of the client and this will be proper consent for such surgery or other intervention. Such consent will be valid, notwithstanding the type of admission of the client, and it shall also be valid whether or not the client has been adjudged incompetent.

      As used in this chapter, the term "community services" means a coordinated, consumer and family centered, consumer and family directed, and comprehensive system of community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that enable individuals with developmental disabilities to exercise self-determination, be independent, be productive, and be integrated and included in all facets of community life. Such services shall include those deemed reasonably necessary by the department to provide for education, training, rehabilitation, and care of individuals with developmental disabilities and shall include but not be limited to: diagnostic and evaluation services; day-care and training services; work-activity services; support coordination, day support, and personal support services; supportive employment services; community residential services such as group family-care homes, community living arrangements, and host homes; transportation services incidental to educational, training, and rehabilitation services; technology and durable equipment support and services; social services; medical services; and specified home services.

     <b>
      Purpose of procedural safeguards contained in chapter.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Procedural safeguards contained in O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 37 are obviously for purpose of ensuring that individual rights are not eroded in name of medical expediency. Kendrick v. Metropolitan Psychiatric Ctr., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 839</cite>, <cite class="app_court">282 S.E.2d 361</cite> (1981).

     <b>
      Procedural safeguards of chapter must be strictly complied with.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 37 involves extremely sensitive area of deprivation of liberty and requires strict compliance with all of its procedures. Kendrick v. Metropolitan Psychiatric Ctr., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 839</cite>, <cite class="app_court">282 S.E.2d 361</cite> (1981).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Reason for requiring rigid adherence to designated procedures.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Rigid adherence to designated procedures is especially important in light of relative ease with which one may be taken from first interview with a physician to involuntary confinement and treatment. Kendrick v. Metropolitan Psychiatric Ctr., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 839</cite>, <cite class="app_court">282 S.E.2d 361</cite> (1981).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Provisions for contesting confinement.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 37 amply provides for the invocation of legal measures to contest the validity of confinement. Watkins v. Roche, 529 F. Supp. 327 (S.D. Ga. 1981).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Rationale for limited liability of private physicians.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - Throughout the various provisions of O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 37, the judgment of the private physician is sought, but is not required. Rather, it is the judgment of the state's physicians that is determinative of the question of further examination or treatment. To open physicians to federal suit by decreeing that the physicians act for the state in making purely medical decisions would effectively chill the use, and accompanying benefit, of a private physician's judgment in an emergency situation simply because the physician may not be willing to give it for fear of being exposed to a lawsuit. The disadvantage in this is that the statutory alternatives do not provide the immediacy of action of a physician's certificate. Watkins v. Roche, 529 F. Supp. 327 (S.D. Ga. 1981).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Treatment time limits.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 37 prescribes maximum time limits for steps leading to treatment, but no minimums. If two physicians agree that an individual needs involuntary treatment as contemplated by that chapter, the elapsed time between the patient's arrival at the first doctor's office or at the hospital and onset of involuntary psychiatric treatment could be no more than the time occupied by two interviews, which is the outer limits of due process and cannot be reduced by procedural safeguards any further. Kendrick v. Metropolitan Psychiatric Ctr., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 839</cite>, <cite class="app_court">282 S.E.2d 361</cite> (1981).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 37 provides citizens with the means of protecting themselves from those persons suffering from alcohol or drug related problems, as well as at the same time helping those who, because of their problem, are unable to help themselves. Such concern and conduct is simply not the exclusive province of the state, and O.C.G.A.

         Presence of state action in initiating involuntary examination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Subjugation of an individual for an involuntary examination is not dependent upon a physician's certificate. Laymen may, by way of affidavits, initiate the process leading to an examination as well, although in not as a direct a manner as physicians. Secondly, physicians are not compelled by the state to sign certificates. Both of these factors militate against the finding of state action against a doctor to support an action under 42 U.S.C.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c07s37-7-41" target="_self">37-7-41</a></cite> permits ordinary citizens other than doctors to initiate the process for securing examinations, the suggestion of state action under the theory of performing a "public function" is weakened, if not eliminated. Otherwise, the actions of laymen would be subjected to the label of state action. Watkins v. Roche, 529 F. Supp. 327 (S.D. Ga. 1981).

By allowing a physician to bypass the necessity of obtaining a court order, the General Assembly implicitly recognized that a physician's training, expertise, and professionalism qualify the physician to make a judgment in the best interests of a person to which a court could add but little, if anything.

The beliefs of laymen, grounded on credible observations, are sufficient to warrant a court ordered examination. The fact that a court makes the final decision should not be viewed as meaning that the nature of a physician's conduct, in the context of subsection (a), is equal to that of the court in terms of state action. The distinction in procedure is justified since it is rare that laymen are qualified to make medical judgments. The presence, or rather, the interposition, of the court serves as a shield to guard against malicious or vexatious attempts to harass a person by subjecting the person to needless examinations. Watkins v. Roche, 529 F. Supp. 327 (S.D. Ga. 1981).

       <p>
        - State does not reward a physician for executing a certificate or punish a physician for failing to sign one. The language of this section clearly states that "Any physician . . . may execute a certificate . . ." and in no manner implies that the execution of the certificate is mandatory. Obviously, the physician enjoys discretion in the matter. Watkins v. Roche, 529 F. Supp. 327 (S.D. Ga. 1981).

         Power under certificate is very limited, despite involuntary aspects.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Consequence of a certificate is nothing more than an examination, albeit involuntary. The power of a certificate is very limited. It does not commit a person for treatment. It merely subjects a person to any emergency care that may be required and an examination by the state to confirm or reject the beliefs stated in the certificate. Once a person is admitted to a receiving facility, an examination must be made by a state doctor within 24 hours. Watkins v. Roche, 529 F. Supp. 327 (S.D. Ga. 1981).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t37c07s37-7-43" target="_self">37-7-43</a></cite> require a concurring opinion of two physicians that a patient requires involuntary treatment. The first physician's diagnosis and certificate that an individual is in need of treatment authorizes involuntary taking of that person to an emergency receiving facility to undergo, within 24 hours, an examination by a second physician. If upon that second examination the examining physician concludes that the patient is in need of or requires treatment, then that patient can be legally confined in an evaluation facility without his or her consent.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - Decision to refer a person for further evaluation and, perhaps, for treatment rests with the state and the state alone. A private physician cannot commit someone, in the usual sense of the word, solely by a certificate. Basically, the certificate simply initiates the state's involvement and is not of and in itself the point of origin of state action. Watkins v. Roche, 529 F. Supp. 327 (S.D. Ga. 1981).

   The first physician's diagnosis and certificate that an individual is in need of treatment authorizes involuntary taking of that person to an emergency receiving facility to undergo, within 24 hours, an examination by a second physician. If upon that second examination the examining physician concludes that the patient is in need of or requires treatment, then that patient can be legally confined in an evaluation facility without his or her consent.

       If at any time during a period of involuntary outpatient treatment, including but not limited to interim outpatient treatment arranged pursuant to subsection (b) of Code Section 37-7-91, the patient fails without good cause or refuses to comply with the outpatient treatment plan, the physician or psychologist in charge of the outpatient treatment plan or that physician's or psychologist's designee may petition the court originally approving the involuntary treatment of the patient or the court of the county in which the patient is a resident or where the patient may be found for an order authorizing a peace officer to take the patient and immediately deliver the patient to the community mental health center in charge of the patient's outpatient treatment plan, if a physician or psychologist is available there to examine the patient, or to the nearest emergency receiving facility serving the county in which the patient is found. If in the discretion of the court such an order is issued, the patient shall be delivered to the facility and may be given such emergency or other medical treatment as is indicated by good medical practice. The patient must be released from the custody of the community mental health center within four hours and from the custody of the emergency receiving facility within 48 hours after being taken into the custody of that center or facility unless the examining physician or psychologist concludes that, because of a change in the patient's condition, the least restrictive alternative which would accomplish the treatment goals is hospitalization of the patient. The physician or a psychologist may then execute a certificate under the conditions specified therefor in subsection (a) of Code Section 37-7-41, if the examination is done in a community mental health center, or under the conditions specified therefor in Code Section 37-7-43, if the examination is done in an emergency receiving facility.That certificate shall have the same duration and effect as a certificate issued pursuant to subsection (a) of Code Section 37-7-41 or Code Section 37-7-43, as applicable.

       If it is necessary to continue involuntary treatment of a hospitalized patient beyond the end of the period during which the treatment facility is currently authorized under this chapter to retain the patient, the chief medical officer prior to the expiration of the period, shall seek an order authorizing such continued treatment in the manner provided in this Code section. The chief medical officer may seek such an order authorizing continued involuntary treatment involving inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, or both under the procedures of this Code section and Code Section 37-7-93.

       If the chief medical officer finds that continued involuntary treatment is necessary (1) for an individual who was admitted while serving a criminal sentence but whose sentence is about to expire or (2) for an individual who was hospitalized while under the jurisdiction of a juvenile court but who is about to reach the age of 17, the chief medical officer shall seek an order authorizing such continued treatment in the manner provided in this Code section; and this chapter shall apply fully to such a patient after that time.

       A Committee for Continued Involuntary Treatment Review shall be established by the chief medical officer of each hospital and shall consist of not less than five persons of professional status, at least one of whom shall be a physician and at least two others of whom shall be either physicians or psychologists.The committee may conduct its meetings with a quorum of any three members at least one of whom shall be a physician. The function of this committee shall be to review and evaluate the updated individualized treatment plan of each patient of the hospital and to report to the chief medical officer its recommendations concerning the patient's need for continued involuntary treatment. No person who has responsibility for the care and treatment of the individual patient for whom continued involuntary treatment is requested shall serve on any committee which reviews such individual's case.

       If the chief medical officer desires to seek an order under this Code section authorizing continued involuntary treatment for up to 12 months beyond the expiration of the currently authorized period of hospitalization, he shall first file a notice of such intended action with the Committee for Continued Involuntary Treatment Review, which notice shall be forwarded to the committee at least 60 days prior to the expiration of that period.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c07s37-7-83ol1e">
       Within ten days of the date of the notice, the committee shall meet to consider the matter of the chief medical officer's intention to seek an order for continued involuntary treatment. Prior to the committee's meeting, the patient and his representatives shall be notified of the following: the purpose of such meeting, the time and place of such meeting, their right to be present at such meeting, and their right to present any alternative individualized treatment plan secured at their expense. In those cases in which the patient will not or cannot appear, at least one member of the committee will make all reasonable efforts to interview the patient and report to the committee. The physician or psychologist proposing the treatment plan shall present an updated individualized treatment plan for the patient to the committee. The committee shall report to the chief medical officer or his designee, other than the physician or psychologist proposing the treatment plan or a member of the committee, its written recommendations along with any minority recommendations which may also be submitted. Such report will specify whether or not the patient is an alcoholic, a drug dependent individual, or a drug abuser requiring involuntary treatment and whether continued hospitalization is the least restrictive alternative available.

Such person may apply for voluntary admission pursuant to Code Section 37-7-24.

       If after considering the committee's recommendations and minority recommendations, if any, the chief medical officer or his designee, other than the attending physician or member of the committee, determines that the patient is an alcoholic, a drug dependent individual, or a drug abuser requiring involuntary treatment, he shall, within ten days after receiving the committee's recommendations, serve a petition for an order authorizing continued involuntary treatment along with copies of the updated individualized treatment plan and the committee's report on the designated office within the department and shall also serve such petition along with a copy of the updated individualized treatment plan on the patient. A copy of the petition shall be served on the patient's representatives. The petition shall contain a plain and simple statement that the patient or his representatives may file a request for a hearing with a hearing examiner appointed pursuant to Code Section 37-7-84 within 15 days after service of the petition, that the patient has a right to counsel, that the patient or his representatives may apply immediately to the court to have counsel appointed if the patient cannot afford counsel, and that the court will appoint counsel for the patient unless the patient indicates in writing that he does not desire to be represented by counsel or has made his own arrangements for counsel.

       If a hearing is not requested by the patient or the representatives within 15 days of service of the petition on the patient and his representatives, the hearing examiner shall make an independent review of the committee's report, the updated individualized treatment plan, and the petition. If he concludes that continued involuntary treatment may not be necessary or if he finds any member of the committee so concluded, then he shall order that a hearing be held pursuant to subsection (i) of this Code section. If he concludes that continued involuntary treatment is necessary, then he shall order continued involuntary treatment involving inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, or both for a period not to exceed one year.

       If a hearing is requested within 15 days of service of the petition on the patient and his representatives or if the hearing examiner orders a hearing pursuant to subsection (h) or (j) of this Code section, the hearing examiner shall set a time and place for the hearing to be held within 25 days of the time the hearing examiner receives the request but in any event no later than the day on which the current order of involuntary inpatient treatment expires. Notice of the hearing shall be served on the patient, his representatives, the facility, and, when appropriate, on counsel for the patient. The hearing examiner, within his discretion, may grant a change of venue for the convenience of parties or witnesses. Such hearing shall be a full and fair hearing, except that the patient's attorney, when the patient is unable to attend the hearing and is incapable of consenting to a waiver of his appearance, may move that the patient not be required to appear; however, the record shall reflect the reasons for the hearing examiner's actions. After such hearing, the hearing examiner may issue any order which the court is authorized to issue under Code Section 37-7-81.1 and subject to the limitations of that Code Section 37-7-81.1, provided that a patient who is an outpatient who does not meet the requirements for discharge under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of Code Section 37-7-81.1 shall nevertheless be discharged and provided that the hearing examiner may order the patient's continued inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, or both for a period not to exceed one year, subject to the power to discharge the patient under subsection (b) of Code Section 37-7-85 or under Code Section 37-7-94. In the event that an order approving continued hospitalization is entered for an individual who was admitted while serving a criminal sentence under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, but whose sentence is about to expire, the chief medical officer shall serve a copy of that order upon the Department of Corrections within five working days of the issuance of the order.

       The department shall determine all persons who are liable for the cost of care of a patient and notify such persons of their joint and several liability and of their assessment. Such notice shall offer opportunity for any person so notified to be heard to show cause, if there be any, why such person should not be liable for payment of the assessment.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c09s37-9-5ol1b">
       When the department determines that persons legally liable for the cost of care of a patient do not have sufficient income or assets to pay the entire cost of care, the department shall determine for each such person the amount payable toward cost of care which shall be a fair and equitable amount based on ability to pay determined in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 37-9-6. When applicable, the notice provided for in subsection (a) of this Code section shall reflect as the assessment the amount payable toward cost of care provided for in this chapter; and if a hearing is requested by any person receiving such notice, such person may question his liability for cost of care as well as the amount of his assessment.Failure of the patient or other persons liable for cost of care to provide financial information to the department required to determine assessments on the basis of ability to pay in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 37-9-6 or failure of the patient or other persons liable for cost of care to cooperate with the department in obtaining payment of any insurance or health benefits available for a patient may result in assessment of such persons of the full cost of care of the patient.Failure of the patient or other persons liable for cost of care to cooperate with the department in applying on behalf of the patient for federal benefits and insurance, program, or plan benefits in order that a determination may be made of eligibility for such benefits may also result in assessment of such persons of the full cost of care of the patient and the burden of providing information to reduce the full cost of care is on the patient or other persons liable for cost of care.

       Any investigation or hearing regarding ability to pay shall not operate to deny or delay admission of a patient to a hospital or to deny or delay providing services for such patient.

      <li id="t37c09s37-9-5ol1d">
       It shall be the duty of the department to reexamine the assessment periodically and either reduce or increase such assessment as hereinafter provided in accordance with changes in the ability to pay of the person liable for cost of care. If the department determines that the economic circumstances of a person liable for cost of care have improved to an extent justifying an increase in the assessment, any such increase shall apply only to cost of care for services rendered for the patient after the effective date of the increase in assessment and no such increase shall cause the assessment to exceed the total cost of care. The department may not increase an assessment as provided in this Code section without affording the person liable for cost of care an opportunity for a hearing on the question of the increase in the assessment. A person liable for cost of care may apply to the department for a change in the assessment when the person's economic circumstances have changed sufficiently to affect adversely his future ability to pay. If an assessment for services previously rendered for a patient is being paid in accordance with a scheduled plan of payments approved by the department, then a reduction in assessment because of a change in the economic circumstances affecting adversely the ability to pay of the person liable for cost of care may apply to that portion of the assessment for services previously rendered for the patient which remain unpaid as of the date of the reduction of the assessment as well as to the assessment for cost of services rendered after the date of the reduction. However, no such reduction shall require the refund of any payments made on an assessment prior to the date of the reduction of the assessment. After investigation and hearing, the department shall act upon the application made by the person liable for cost of care. Any redetermination of the assessment pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the requirements of Code Section 37-9-6.Notwithstanding any reexamination or corresponding adjustment of an assessment which might be afforded, each assessment shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of the initial assessment or any reassessment thereafter.No reduction, increase, or opportunity for hearing shall be allowed after the assessment period.

       The department may accept payment for full cost of care if any person liable for cost of care offers such payment in lieu of declaring financial circumstances and having an assessment determined by hearing.Any assessment made pursuant to the authority of this subsection shall be subject to redetermination as provided by subsection (d) of this Code section if requested by the person liable for cost of care.

     <p>
      The board shall establish standards for determining assessments when such assessments are less than the full cost of care. Such standards shall be based on the income, assets, and other circumstances of the persons liable for cost of care and shall include consideration of the number of dependents, as defined under Georgia income tax law and regulations; legal rights to payment under any insurance agreement, and other evidence of ability to pay; but no assessment shall be fixed or collected on the basis of any assets exempted by subsection (b) of Code Section 37-9-8. In determining assessments for persons liable for cost of care, the department shall develop procedures to ensure that no dependent, deduction, or personal exemption as defined by Georgia income tax law will be reflected more than once in the determination of assessments for any one patient. In establishing standards to determine such assessments, the board shall adopt criteria to be applied uniformly to all persons liable for cost of care, except that the board may adopt separate criteria for assessing monthly benefits or funds from any source to cover cost of care, support, and treatment provided to patients who are hospitalized for longer than three months and whose current needs, as defined by the Social Security Administration, are being met. However, the board shall ensure that the assessment made each month shall allow the recipients of such benefits or funds to retain at a minimum an amount as a personal allowance equal to the amount of the personal needs allowance allowed beneficiaries under the state medical assistance plan. Further, such standards will include special provisions for assessing developmental disabilities respite care allowed by law or duly adopted departmental regulations, where such admissions are legally limited to 56 days of care a year. To the extent practicable, such criteria shall ensure that persons having the same or substantially the same financial ability to pay cost of care shall have the same or substantially the same financial obligation to pay such cost of care.

       In addition to the use of income for determining assessments provided for in this chapter and for the payment thereof, any other assets of a person liable for cost of care, except as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, shall be considered in determining an assessment and shall be liable to be assessed for the payment thereof. Such assets shall include any tangible or intangible property or any combination thereof and shall also include the net proceeds derived from the disposition of any such property including any disposition of any such property which took place 90 days or less prior to the date services were first rendered to the patient by a hospital. When the income of a person liable for cost of care is sufficient to determine that an assessment should be made for the total cost of care, it shall not be necessary for the department to investigate and determine the other assets of such person; but such investigation and determination may be made by the department if necessary to collect the assessment from the person liable for cost of care.

      Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the department shall not be required to expend public funds for the purpose of providing support, care, and treatment covered under this chapter to any patient until such patient has exhausted his or her eligibility and receipt of benefits under all other existing or future private, public, local, state, or federal programs or plans. Before the department expends public funds for a patient's cost of care, the department may assess and recover the cost of a patient's care from the patient or other persons liable for such patient's cost of care if such patient is eligible for benefits under any other program or plan.In the event the patient is covered by an insurance contract or any other plan or benefit of any nature providing for payment of hospitalization, medical expenses, and other health care services or any combination thereof, such patient or other person liable for the cost of care of such patient shall pay or cause to have paid from such insurance, plan, or benefit without deduction, exemptions, or credits, the full cost of care of the patient, or that portion thereof covered by such insurance, plan, or benefit. The assessment for cost of care of the patient made by the department pursuant to Code Section 37-9-5 shall be for the total amount payable by such insurance, plan, or benefit up to the total cost of care or for that portion of cost of care payable by such insurance, plan, or benefit; and if the proceeds from such insurance, plan, or benefit are less than the total cost of care, such assessment shall include an assessment based on the remaining balance, except where full payment of the balance or a portion thereof is required by a health insurance program or other plan or benefit, in which case the balance or at least the required portion thereof will be the assessment. Further, the department shall comply with all federally funded health and medical insurance programs which require established amounts payable by beneficiaries and is authorized to accept amounts payable toward cost of care under any insurance program, plan, or benefit if paid according to the provisions of such programs, plans, or benefits even though the amounts payable may exceed cost of care amounts as provided by this chapter. The department shall develop procedures to apply the provisions of this chapter, specifically Code Section 37-9-5, to any amounts which remain payable by the patient or beneficiaries under a federally funded health and medical insurance program, provided that the application of any such procedures does not invalidate payment of benefits under the program.For the purpose of carrying out this Code section, the department is authorized to accept assignment of benefits payable under such insurance, plans, or benefits; but the department shall not require the assignment of such benefits as a condition precedent to the admission of a patient to a hospital or as a condition precedent to providing services for such patient.In order to collect maximum benefits payable toward cost of care, the department is authorized to contract with any insurance program, plan, or benefit to become a participating member hospital if payments are not made or are made at a lesser than full coverage amount to nonparticipating members.Moreover, the department or its designated agents will have subrogation rights to the recovery of a patient's cost of care that the patient or other person liable for the patient's cost of care may have against any person, estate, organization, entity, or plan.Further, if any patient or other person liable for the cost of a patient's care receives benefits or funds in settlement, judgment, or otherwise for any health care, medical expenses, or hospitalization or other care directly related to services and care provided by the department to a patient, the patient or other person liable for cost of care will pay or cause to have paid the full cost of care or that portion thereof recovered which is directly related to the care provided by the department.This right of subrogation is cumulative and in addition to any other remedy and this right shall be available for any enforcement or collection process which is contemplated under other provisions of this chapter.

     <p>
      The Interstate Compact on Mental Health is enacted into law and entered into by the State of Georgia with any and all states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <div>
      <h5>
       INTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       The Contracting States solemnly agree that:

        A
       </span>
       RTICLE I.
      </p>
      <p>
       The party States find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party States find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party States to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalized or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party States in terms of such welfare.

Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, he shall be detained in the State where found pending disposition in accordance with law.
        </p>
        <p>
         The duly accredited officers of any State party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the patient, shall be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to this compact through any and all States party to this compact, without interference.

        <p>
         The duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party States may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility or for the maintenance of any institution on a joint or cooperative basis whenever the States concerned shall find that such agreements will improve services, facilities or institutional care and treatment in the fields of mental illness or mental deficiency. No such supplementary agreement shall be construed so as to relieve any party State of any obligation which it otherwise would have under other provisions of this compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         This compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any State when enacted by it into law and such State shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all States legally joining therein.

         The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any party, State, or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any State party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining States and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

       RTICLE III.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever a person physically present in any party State shall be in need of institutionalization by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency, he shall be eligible for care and treatment in an institution in that State irrespective of his residence, settlement or citizenship qualifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision of paragraph (a) of this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another State whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph shall include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof, and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       No State shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Article unless the sending State has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient, furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient, given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving State an opportunity to examine the patient if said authorities so wish; and unless the receiving State shall agree to accept the patient.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event that the laws of the receiving State establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that he would be taken if he were a local patient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such further transfer of the patient may be made as seems likely to be in the best interest of the patient.
      </p>

       <span>

       </span>
       RTICLE IV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the State in which a patient is physically present, it shall be determined that the patient should receive after-care or supervision, such care or supervision may be provided in a receiving State. If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending State shall have reason to believe that after-care in another State would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving State to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such after-care in said receiving State, and such investigation shall be made with all immediate speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient's intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient and such other documents as may be pertinent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending State and the appropriate authorities in the receiving State find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive after-care or supervision in the receiving State.
      </p>
      <p>
       In supervising, treating or caring for a patient on after-care pursuant to the terms of this Article, a receiving State shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care and treatment that it employs for similar local patients.

      </p>
      <p>
       No person shall be deemed a patient of more than one institution at any given time. Completion of transfer of any patient to an institution in a receiving State shall have the effect of making the person a patient of the institution in the receiving State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sending State shall pay all costs of and incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this compact, but any two or more party States may, by making a specific agreement for that purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       No provision of this compact shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party State, or between a party State and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party State or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party State or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to any provision of this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any reciprocal agreement between a party State and a non-party State relating to institutionalization, care or treatment of the mentally ill or mentally deficient, or any statutory authority pursuant to which such agreements may be made.

      <p>
       Nothing in this compact shall be construed to abridge, diminish, or in any way impair the rights, duties and responsibilities of any patient's guardian on his behalf or in respect to any patient for whom he may serve, except that where the transfer of any patient to another jurisdiction makes advisable the appointment of a supplemental or substitute guardian, any court of competent jurisdiction in the receiving State may make such supplemental or substitute appointment and the court which appointed the previous guardian shall upon being duly advised of the new appointment, and upon the satisfactory completion of such accounting and other acts as such court may by law require, relieve the previous guardian of power and responsibility to whatever extent shall be appropriate in the circumstances; provided, however, that in the case of any patient having settlement in the sending State, the court of competent jurisdiction in the sending State shall have the sole discretion to relieve a guardian appointed by it or continue his power and responsibility, whichever it shall deem advisable. The court in the receiving State may, in its discretion, confirm or reappoint the person or persons previously serving as guardian in the sending State in lieu of making a supplemental or substitute appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "guardian" as used in paragraph (a) of this Article shall include any guardian, trustee, legal committee, conservator, or other person or agency however denominated who is charged by law with power to act for or with responsibility for the person or property of a patient.

       RTICLE IX.
      </p>
      <p>
       No provision of this compact except Article V shall apply to any person institutionalized while under sentence in a penal or correctional institution or while subject to trial on a criminal charge, or whose institutionalization is due to the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness or mental deficiency, said person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional institution.
      </p>
      <p>
       To every extent possible, it shall be the policy of States party to this compact that no patient shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup, but such patient shall, with all expedition, be taken to a suitable institutional facility for mental illness or mental deficiency.

       Each party State shall appoint a "compact administrator" who, on behalf of his State, shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his State and who shall receive copies of all reports, correspondence, and other documents relating to any patient processed under the compact by his State either in the capacity of sending or receiving State. The compact administrator or his duly designated representative shall be the official with whom other party States shall deal in any matter relating to the compact or any patient processed thereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compact administrators of the respective party States shall have power to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.

       A State party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect one year after notice thereof has been communicated officially and in writing to the Governors and compact administrators of all other party States. However, the withdrawal of any State shall not change the status of any patient who has been sent to said State or sent out of said State pursuant to the provisions of the compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Withdrawal from any agreement permitted by Article VII, paragraph (b), as to costs or from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to Article XI shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement.

       Pursuant to said compact, the commissioner of behavioral health and developmental disabilities, or his delegate, is hereby designated to be the compact administrator. The compact administrator, acting jointly with like officers of other party States, shall have power to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms of the compact. The compact administrator is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to cooperate with all departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of this State and its subdivisions in facilitating the proper administration of the compact or any supplementary agreement or agreements entered into by this State thereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compact administrator is hereby authorized and empowered to enter into supplementary agreements with appropriate officials of other States pursuant to Articles VII and XI of the compact. In the event that such supplementary agreements shall require or contemplate the use of any institution or facility of this State or require or contemplate the provision of any service of this State, no such agreement shall have force or effect until approved by the head of the department or agency under whose jurisdiction said institution or facility is operated or whose department or agency will be charged with the rendering of such service.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compact administrator, using funds appropriated to the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities and the Department of Public Health, may make or arrange for any payments necessary to discharge any financial obligations imposed upon this State by the compact or by any supplementary agreement entered into thereunder.

      <p>
       The compact administrator is hereby directed to consult with the immediate family of any proposed transferee and, in the case of a proposed transfer from an institution in this State to an institution in another party State, to take no final action without notice to the admitting court or in case of admission other than by a court, then notice to the admitting medical facility is required.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the administration of this compact, the compact administrator shall in no way abridge the rights or privileges of any patient to appeal to the courts for a hearing as provided under the laws of Georgia.
