       - Since, during the trial of a state patrolman for false imprisonment, it appeared from the evidence that the patrolman's sole defense was that the patrolman made the arrest for drunkenness upon the public highway without a warrant because the patrolman, in good faith, had probable cause to believe that the offense was being committed in the patrolman's presence, a failure to instruct the jury on a good faith defense was an error, requiring the grant of a new trial.

However, there is no authority for the Uniform Division to provide private security, within or without the boundaries of Georgia. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-14.

        - When the function to be performed involves something other than the enforcement of traffic and motor vehicle laws, the enforcement of criminal laws on state property, or apprehending fugitives, some further requirement is necessary to authorize the activity; that further requirement may be either the Governor's direction to suppress riots or labor strikes or assist in a criminal case investigation, a local law enforcement request for assistance in a criminal matter, or the failure to prevent or detect a criminal act because of the unavailability of a local law enforcement officer at the time. 1987 Op.

        If a coach or anyone else is attacked in the presence of a trooper and there is no local law enforcement officer immediately available to respond, the trooper is a sworn officer and has a duty, recognized by statute, to intervene to stop the criminal act and arrest the attacker; in so doing, the trooper is acting within the scope of employment, and, under the terms of the present policy, is entitled to insurance coverage. However, there is no authority for the Uniform Division to provide private security, within or without the boundaries of Georgia. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-14.

       - State proved that the false statement alleged in the indictment was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) because the GBI was actively investigating a missing person case; because two videos contained clues referencing a Georgia missing person and the location of a missing person's body parts in Augusta, and it was then determined that the computer from which the videos were being posted was in Georgia, the jury could reasonably infer that the other missing person cases referenced in the first video would have a Georgia connection, giving the GBI jurisdiction to investigate the cases.

       - State proved that the false statement alleged in the indictment was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) because: the GBI was actively investigating a missing person case; two videos contained clues referencing a Georgia missing person and the location of a missing person's body parts in Augusta; and, the computer from which the videos were being posted was in Georgia. Therefore, the jury could reasonably infer that the other missing person cases referenced in the first video would have a Georgia connection, giving the GBI jurisdiction to investigate the cases.

       - State proved that the false statement alleged in the indictment was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) because: the GBI was actively investigating a missing person case; two videos contained clues referencing a Georgia missing person and the location of a missing person's body parts in Augusta; and, the computer from which the videos were being posted was in Georgia. Therefore, the jury could reasonably infer that the other missing person cases referenced in the first video would have a Georgia connection, giving the GBI jurisdiction to investigate the cases.

       - If a criminal record is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, a superior court has three available remedies - expungement, modification, or supplementation - so long as the court finds the remedy to be "required by law" and "appropriate."

       <p>
        <p>
       - Expungement should be reserved for exceptional cases based upon competing state and citizen interests, and the fact that the defendant's arrest record did not reflect that the defendant was acquitted by operation of law did not constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting the remedy of expungement instead of modification or supplement.

      effective April 28, 2019, deleted former paragraph (a)(2), which read: " 'Division' means the Division of Forensic Sciences of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation."; redesignated former paragraph (a)(3) as present paragraph (a)(2); substituted the present provisions of paragraph (a)(2) for the former provisions, which read: "Detention facility" means a penal institution under the jurisdiction of the department used for the detention of persons convicted of a felony, including penal institutions operated by a private company on behalf of the department, inmate work camps, inmate boot camps, probation detention centers, and parole revocation centers. Such term shall also mean any facility operated under the jurisdiction of a sheriff used for the detention of persons convicted of a felony including a county jail or county correctional facility."; added paragraph (a)(3); substituted the present provisions of subsection (b) for the former provisions, which read: "Any person convicted of a felony offense who is held in a detention facility or placed on probation shall at the time of entering the detention facility or being placed on probation have a sample of his or her blood, an oral swab, or a sample obtained from a noninvasive procedure taken for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis to determine identification characteristics specific to the person. The provisions and requirements of this Code section shall also apply to any person who has been convicted of a felony prior to July 1, 2011, and who currently is incarcerated in a detention facility, serving a probation sentence, or serving under the jurisdiction of the Board of Pardons and Paroles for such offense. It shall be the responsibility of the detention facility detaining or entity supervising a convicted felon to collect the samples required by this Code section and forward the sample to the division unless such sample has already been collected by the department or another agency or entity."; and, in subsection (c), substituted "DNA" for "The" at the beginning of the first sentence, in the third sentence, substituted "identifying" for "identification" near the beginning and inserted "in accordance with Code Sections 35-3-162 and 35-3-163" near the end.

       Classification of subjecting convicted felons but not convicted misdemeanants to the DNA identification process was rationally related to the Georgia legislature's legitimate law enforcement purpose of creating a permanent identification record of convicted felons because the statute encompassed all convicted felons whose crimes and/or past histories were serious enough to warrant a sentence to confinement, as opposed to lesser punishment, and the legislature acted reasonably and not arbitrarily when the legislature focused on those convicted felons who were housed in a correctional facility where DNA samples can be efficiently and economically obtained.

The General Assembly further finds that the work of some of these agencies overlaps, and that the at-risk families and troubled children of Georgia will be more efficiently and effectively served by consolidating the Children and Youth Coordinating Council with the Children's Trust Fund Commission, by placing the functions of the Georgia Child Fatality Review Panel under the supervision of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children, and by encouraging these consolidated agencies to collaborate to create a consistent vision for serving the needs of our state's families in need."

        <p>
       - Trial court erred by entering a default judgment against a police officer for failing to timely answer because the officer was immune from suit on the claim brought under state law; thus, the default judgment entered on that claim was a nullity and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and should have dismissed the state law cause of action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

        <p>
       - With respect to law enforcement officers claiming qualified immunity in a case alleging that certain searches violated Fourth Amendment rights, the officers could show that the officers were acting within the officers' discretionary authority because it is clear that performing searches and assisting in arrests are legitimate job-related functions within the power of law enforcement bodies under O.C.G.A.

       - In a suit by a passenger against a Department of Corrections (DOC) probation officer whose vehicle collided with the passenger's vehicle during a police chase, because the officer's actions were consistent with DOC's non-defective policy, which allowed the officer to assist law enforcement, DOC had sovereign immunity under O.C.G.A.

       - Because a peace officer's invocation of a right against self-incrimination could not shield that officer from an inquiry into the effect of that assertion on the officer's job performance, and because the record supported an administrative decision that the officer's refusal to cooperate in an investigation provided sufficient grounds for the Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council to enter an order of decertification, the superior court erred in reversing an administrative law judge's decision upholding the decertification and finding that the officer's actions amounted to unprofessional conduct.

        - When a deputy arrested a person for being drunk at a high school football game, the deputy was entitled to qualified immunity as to the arrestee's excessive force claim because, inter alia, the deputy was certified under Georgia law and, thus, the requirement that registered peace officers not have more than a 12-month gap between positions in law enforcement was inapplicable to the deputy.

        County was statutorily required to maintain duplicate personnel records for a police officer who worked for the county school system and to forward a copy of the records to the Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council, and the county was required by regulation to inform the Council when the officer resigned in lieu of termination; dismissal of the officer's claim for breach of an alleged contract requiring the county to report only that the officer resigned was proper.

      It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any municipal or county police department or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the municipal or county police department or a member thereof. Furthermore, the municipal or county police department, which has provided quality law enforcement services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the department, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any municipal or county police department's name or any term used to identify the department or its members without the expressed permission of the local governing authority. The provisions of this chapter are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.
