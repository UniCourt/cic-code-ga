      The provisions of this chapter are enacted to further the policy of the State of Georgia to encourage and enable persons with disabilities or elderly persons to participate fully in the social and economic life of Georgia and to encourage and promote their education and rehabilitation. It is the intent of this chapter to eliminate, insofar as possible, unnecessary physical barriers encountered by persons with disabilities or elderly persons whose ability to participate in the social and economic life of this state is needlessly restricted when such persons cannot readily use government buildings, public buildings, and facilities used by the public.

Within ten days after receipt of the report, the director shall acknowledge receipt of the report, in writing, to the person making the report.

A hearing upon such petition and notice thereof shall be carried out pursuant to subsection (f) of this Code section. If as a result of the hearing the court finds probable cause to believe that the person named in the petition is a disabled adult in need of protective services or an elder person needing protective services and that any other person is interfering with the conduct of an investigation required under this Code section, the court may issue an order authorizing that investigation and prohibiting interference therewith by any person.

A hearing upon such petition and notice thereof shall be carried out pursuant to subsection (f) of this Code section. If as a result of the hearing the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person named in the petition is a disabled adult in need of protective services or an elder person needing protective services and that any other person is interfering with the provision of such services, the court may issue an order authorizing the provision of such services and prohibiting the interference therewith by any person.

The judge, in his or her discretion, may issue an ex parte order requiring the caretaker or any other person at the place where the disabled adult or elder person resides to afford an adult protection agency employee immediate access to such person to determine the person's well-being.

       Evidence that the defendant falsely convinced the first victim that the victim's grandson needed bail money and falsely convinced the second victim that the defendant was in financial difficulty in Malaysia and trying to return to children in the U.S. was sufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty of two counts of exploitation of an elderly person.

       Evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's convictions of exploitation of a disabled adult and theft by taking because the jury was presented evidence sufficient from which the jury could conclude that the defendant acted with guilty knowledge and criminal intent when taking funds from the defendant's mother's account, especially after the defendant became the mother's guardian and the conservator of the mother's assets. The evidence showed that the defendant concealed required information on the petition for appointment of a guardian and/or conservator the defendant wrote checks and executed transfers from the mother's individual account to joint accounts and then transferred the money to the defendant's individual account and used the money to pay the defendant's personal expenses.

       Sufficient evidence supported the appellant's convictions on two counts of exploitation of elder person, two counts of theft by taking, and 11 counts of financial-transaction-card fraud based on at least circumstantial evidence that the appellant's mother did not authorize the appellant's near total depletion of various financial accounts by transfers to the appellant's account, ATM withdrawals, money sent to another country, and buying online merchandise, furniture, and jewelry.
