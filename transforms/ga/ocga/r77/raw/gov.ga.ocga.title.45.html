<p class="p4"><b>Construction.</b> - Georgia Court of Appeals erred by inappropriately grafting the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-1-4(b) onto subsection (d) and then defining the types of state programs or operations that would allegedly have to be involved in order for a public employee to present a viable claim for retaliation under subsection (d); by inserting the terms of subsection (b) into subsection (d), and then defining those inapplicable terms with language that does not exist, the court engaged erroneously in rewriting the statute. Colon v. Fulton County, 294 Ga. 93, 751 S.E.2d 307 (2013), overruled on other grounds, Rivera v. Washington, 2016 Ga. LEXIS 248 (Ga. 2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The residency requirement for a candidate for any county office, except offices of a judicial nature, shall be 12 months' residency within the county. The residency requirement for a candidate for any municipal office, except offices of a judicial nature, shall be 12 months' residency within the municipality; provided, however, that municipalities may by charter provide for lesser residency requirements for candidates for municipal office, except offices of a judicial nature. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, the General Assembly may provide by local law for a period of district residency for candidates for any county or municipal governing authority or board of education who are elected from districts not to exceed 12 months' residency within the district from which each such candidate seeks election.

<p class="p4"><b>No restoration of public office.</b> - While the grant of a pardon restores one to full rights of citizenship, including the right to hold public office, and operates to remove all blot and stain growing out of a previous conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude, it does not operate to confer or restore a public office which was previously held, but which on account of the previous conviction and sentence was necessarily relinquished.

<p class="p4"><b>Lack of standing.</b> - Former county commissioner lacked U.S. Const. Art. III standing to pursue a suit alleging that the redistricting done under 2002 Ga.

Laws 401 was found unconstitutional, a new redistricting plan might still cause the commissioner to lose the commissioner's incumbent status, thereby preventing the commissioner from running for the office of commissioner in the district that the commissioner served for eight years because the commissioner was no longer a resident of that district, as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-2-1; thus, the commissioner's injury could not be redressed by a favorable decision.

<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of common law.</b> - At common law, one could simultaneously hold two public offices unless the two were incompatible, and incompatibility existed when performance of duties of one office interfered with performance of duties of the other. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-6.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prohibition against simultaneously holding two county offices.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-2-2 is a direct prohibition against an individual holding two county offices at the same time. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-89. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-2-2 prohibits simultaneous holding of two county offices, or one county officer being deputy to another. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-6.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A special enactment may authorize a plurality of offices,</b> and since this section itself contemplates a special enactment, such an enactment may be made without violating the constitutional prohibition against enactment of special laws when provision has been made by general law. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U71-34.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time of creation of county office not controlling.</b> - The general law that members of county boards of tax assessors are ineligible to serve on county boards of education is applicable to a county, even though the county school system was created prior to adoption of the Constitution of 1877. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 58.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"County officers" defined.</b> - In a technical sense, the term "county officers" includes only the "county officers" referred to in 1945, Art. XI, Sec. II, Para. 1 (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. I, Para. III), i.e., those who are elected by the qualified voters of their respective counties and hold office for four years. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 146. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ordinarily, unless there is some special statute, a county police officer does not come within the term of one holding a county office. The county office within the purview of this section has been held to be an office created by law for a term of four years and elected by the people of the county. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No disqualification from running for another office.</b> - This section does not say that a person holding one office shall be disqualified to be elected to another, but merely says that a person may not hold two such offices at the same time; the effect of this language is that a person holding one office is not disqualified from running for another, but on election to the latter office, that person automatically forfeits the first. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 146.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Qualifying as candidate for another office not prohibited.</b> - Although this section declares that no person shall hold two county offices, it appears that qualifying as a candidate for the office of ordinary (now judge of probate court) while serving as a justice of the peace, would not result in placing the candidate in the position of holding two county offices; moreover, a justice of the peace is not a county but a state officer. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-219.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of county officer winning primary nomination for another county office.</b> - A member of the county board of education would be eligible to run in a county primary for the office of county commissioner, since a primary is not an election in the strict sense of the term, and obviously does not result in placing the successful nominee in the position of "holding" an office within the meaning of this section; however, if the person receives the nomination, that person must resign as a member of the school board prior to qualifying in general a election for commissioner. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 146.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>No vacancy created.</b> - The office does not expire at the expiration of the term, but the elected officer holds over until a successor is commissioned and qualified. Holding over prevents vacancy. Stephenson v. Powell, 169 Ga. 406, 150 S.E. 641 (1929). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An office is not vacant so long as it is filled by an incumbent who is legally qualified to exercise the powers and perform the duties which pertain to it. Garcia v. Miller, 261 Ga. 531, 408 S.E.2d 97 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Superior court judge to serve "until his successor is qualified."</b> - Previous state constitutions explicitly provided that the term of office for superior court judges "shall be for four years, and until his successor is qualified." Omission of the phrase "until his successor is qualified" in the 1983 Constitution does not prevent judges from remaining in office after their four-year term of office ends. Garcia v. Miller, 261 Ga. 531, 408 S.E.2d 97 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a complete and continuous judicial system is required to ensure that governmental functions continue without interruption, the judicial power of holdover superior court judges remains vested in them until their successors are qualified. Garcia v. Miller, 261 Ga. 531, 408 S.E.2d 97 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commission not conclusive evidence as to term of office.</b> - A commission issued by the Governor to a duly elected member of the board of education of a county, in which the term of such officer is stated to be for a given number of years and to end on a designated date, is not conclusive evidence of the right of such officer to hold beyond such term and designated date, and does not prevent courts from looking behind the commission and determining, in a proper case, when the term of such officer legally begins and ends. The statute and not the commission determines the commencement and ending of the term of such officer. Stephenson v. Powell, 169 Ga. 406, 150 S.E. 641 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Board of commissioners to hold over.</b> - After a local Act was enacted to abolish the board of county commissioners and establish a new board, but the Act failed to provide for an election date for the new members, the members of the board existing at the date of its passage should discharge the duties and functions of their office until the members of the new board are elected and qualified. Kidd v. Nelson, 213 Ga. 417, 99 S.E.2d 123 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislature may specify a special procedure to fill vacancies in positions of county commissioners</b> as long as that procedure violates no other constitutional provision. Smith v. Abercrombie, 235 Ga. 741, 221 S.E.2d 802 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability on bond continues.</b> - The effect of this section is to extend the term of office under the original appointment until a successor has been qualified, with the further effect that liability on an official bond continues when an official elected for a fixed period thereafter holds over, after its expiration, until a successor is appointed. City of Elberton v. Jones, 35 Ga. App. 536, 133 S.E. 745 (1926). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the general rule is that sureties are liable only for a breach of official duty committed by their principal during the term of office for which the bond was given, the effect of this section is to extend the term of office under the original appointment until a successor has been qualified, with the further effect that liability on such a bond continues when an official elected for a fixed period thereafter holds over, after its expiration, until a successor is appointed. Century Indem. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 175 Ga. 834, 166 S.E. 235 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hold over official properly replaced.</b> - Removal of the appellant from a city zoning board was upheld because once the appellant held over, the appellant could be replaced at any time, without regard to cause, by the city council appointing a successor and since the member did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the position once becoming a holdover official, the appellant was not entitled to due process protections before the city council appointed the successor.

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>45-4-20. - This section, speaking in a general sense, was enacted to prevent miscarriages of justice that might occur whenever such a bond is not approved as prescribed by law. Century Indem. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 175 Ga. 834, 166 S.E. 235 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Bond with nonconforming contents taking the place of official bond.</b> - The law requiring a bond for the Commissioner of Agriculture, and the bond alleged to have been breached being the only bond given by the defendant as Commissioner of Agriculture, and being the bond under which the person served as Commissioner of Agriculture during the time alleged, the bond, even assuming if it was irregular in some respects, "stands in the place of the official bond." Talmadge v. McDonald, 44 Ga. App. 728, 162 S.E. 856 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the bond executed by a public official who was required by statute to execute a bond for the faithful performance of the duties of the office contained limitations upon the liability of the principal and the surety which were not permissible in the statutory bond, it was payable to the obligee required by the statute, and it was the intention of the parties to execute the statutory bond required of a public officer for the faithful performance of the duties of the office; therefore, the limitations were void, and the bond was to be considered as the statutory bond required. American Sur. Co. v. Googe, 45 Ga. App. 108, 163 S.E. 293 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Bond not properly executed and approved taking the place of official bond.</b> - When a bond was executed by a bank, which had been legally designated as a depository to receive money for a county in which the office of treasurer had been abolished, and the bond was conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the bank of its duties as county depository but was made payable to a designated person described therein as the ordinary "in and for said county, for the time being, and his successors in office," and, when the county was one which had a commissioner to whom the bond should have been made payable as required by former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 571 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-6-4), and the bond was approved by the ordinary (now probate judge), the tax collector, and the commissioner, as the "county depository commission," instead of by the commissioner, as required by that section, the bond was one indemnifying the county against loss of county funds while in the possession of the bank as the county depository; and while the bond was not executed and approved as required by law, it stood, by virtue of former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 298 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-4-20), in the place of the official bond required by law of a depository of county funds.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bond not properly executed creating common law liability.</b> - A bond of a public officer of this state, not made payable to the obligee designated by the statute requiring such bond, and not conditioned as prescribed by law, is not vitiated, but is a common-law undertaking rather than a statutory bond, and the surety on such a bond is only liable under the provisions contained in such bond.

<p class="p4"><b>Bond is binding even though not signed by the principal.</b> - When an official bond is made, delivered, accepted, and acted upon as an official bond, the same being a joint and several obligation under its terms and provisions, it is binding on both principal and surety, though not signed by the principal.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Option to bring personal suit or action on official bond.</b> - If a person has been injured and has suffered damage by any wrongful act committed by an officer under color of office, the person can sue such officer personally or upon the officer's official bond, and recover the amount of the damage. Citizens' Bank v. American Sur. Co., 174 Ga. 852, 164 S.E. 817 (1932); Jones v. Reed, 58 Ga. App. 72, 197 S.E. 665 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Suit for wrongful act by sheriff or deputy.</b> - Suit may be brought upon the sheriff's bond for any wrongful act "committed under color of the his office" by the sheriff or a deputy, and such a bond is obligatory upon the principal and sureties thereon for the "use and benefit of every person who is injured" by such wrongful act. Richards v. American Sur. Co., 48 Ga. App. 102, 171 S.E. 924 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Suit by member of the public not authorized on nonofficial bond.</b> - When the instrument sued on in an action against a municipal police officer for false arrest, is not a statutory official bond, and consequently can be enforced only according to the terms and obligations stated in the bond, the terms of this section cannot be read into the bond so as to authorize a suit in favor of a member of the public. Collins v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 72 Ga.

<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Liability of Sureties</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sureties are chargeable with knowledge of the law,</b> and of having executed official bonds with reference to the law. Citizens' Bank v. American Sur. Co., 174 Ga. 852, 164 S.E. 817 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sureties are chargeable with subsequent changes in the law.</b> - By the proviso in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and similar provisions, a surety is given notice that on executing bond with the ordinary it would become liable for the faithful discharge of the duties of that officer under any law subsequently passed, and also that under some latter statute it might become liable for more than the injury actually sustained. It thus consented to become liable along with the officer whose duties and responsibilities were subject to change by law, thereby contracting for the future, to the extent of such changes as would be germane. National Sur. Corp. v. Gatlin, 192 Ga. 293, 15 S.E.2d 180 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Liability for wrongful acts of sheriff.</b> - The sureties on the bonds of sheriffs of this state are liable to persons for injuries proximately resulting to them: (1) because of the failure of the sheriff to perform a duty imposed upon the sheriff by law; (2) because of the improper or neglectful performance of such a duty; and (3) for any wrongful act committed under color of the sheriff's office. Goforth v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., 80 Ga. App. 121, 55 S.E.2d 656 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability for wrongful acts of deputy sheriff.</b> - A failure of a sheriff, by and through a deputy, to faithfully perform the duties of office constitutes a breach of the official bond given by the sheriff for the faithful performance of the duties of office, and a right of action against the surety for the breach of the bond arises ex contractu in favor of any person aggrieved by such breach of the bond. Powell v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 48 Ga. App. 529, 173 S.E. 196 (1934); Hawkins v. National Sur. Corp., 63 Ga. App. 417, 11 S.E.2d 250 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The official bond given by a sheriff, conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of office, obligates the surety thereon for any breach of official duty by the sheriff's deputies, and this includes deputies de facto.

<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff bound by election of remedy.</b> - When the plaintiff had previously elected to sue on the bond of the sheriff, instead of on the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>deputy's bond, for the alleged wrongful acts of the sheriff and the deputy and had prosecuted that suit to judgment for an amount less than the penal sum of the sheriff's bond, as it did not appear that such judgment could not be satisfied (as in fact it had been), the plaintiff was bound by that election and was barred from maintaining a second present suit, on the deputy's bond, for the same damage and injury for which the plaintiff had previously recovered judgment against the surety on the sheriff's bond. Shelton v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., 86 Ga. App. 818, 72 S.E.2d 813 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Who is required by general law to give a bond.</b> - The provisions embraced in this section were intended to be applicable only to the public officers of this state who are required by general law to give bonds for the faithful performance of duties they owe to the public at large.

Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 89-407 and 89-420 were not, therefore, to be regarded as having any application whatever to a bonded officer of a municipality who is required, by special legislation relating to that municipality alone, to give such a bond as the mayor and council may deem necessary to the proper protection of the city itself.

<p class="p4">When the instrument sued on in an action against a municipal police officer for false arrest, is not a statutory official bond, and consequently can be enforced only according to the terms and obligations stated in the bond, the terms of the statute cannot be read into the bond so as to authorize a suit in favor of a member of the public.

<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 45-4-25 inapplicable to any bond not required by law at time of its creation.</b> - Since the bond was not required by statute or law at the time of its creation, it could not and did not "stand in the place of the official bond," and a plaintiff cannot sue thereon in plaintiff's own name as the "person aggrieved."

<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff's recovery not limited to amount of officer's bond.</b> - The public officer would be personally be liable in tort for any official misconduct or acts colore officii whereby the plaintiff was damaged and the plaintiff would not be restricted in a recovery to the amount of the officer's official bond. Cantrell v. National Sur. Co., 46 Ga. App. 202, 167 S.E. 314 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery of expenses limited to action under consideration.</b> - Since this section provides for the awarding of expenses of the suit, including the costs of court, it is construed to mean the present damage suit under consideration, and not the previous litigation; therefore, the plaintiff could not lawfully recover for two items of costs in previous litigation. Talmadge v. McDonald, 44 Ga. App. 728, 162 S.E. 856 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sureties liable for misconduct of deputies.</b> - The words "misconduct of the officer" as used in this section mean not only the misconduct of the sheriff, but also the misconduct of the sheriff's deputies who are the general agents of the sheriff to do and perform all acts which by law appertain to the office, and since the doctrine of respondeat superior applies, the liabilities of the sureties on the sheriff's bond are measured by that of the principal. American Sur. Co. v. Smallon, 54 Ga. App. 45, 186 S.E. 892 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sureties not liable for mere penalties imposed for dereliction of duties.</b> - The liability of sureties on official bonds does not ordinarily include liability for mere penalties imposed upon the principals for a dereliction of official duties, but is limited to injury sustained. National Sur. Corp. v. Gatlin, 192 Ga. 293, 15 S.E.2d 180 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Measure of damages for sheriff's breach of official bond.</b> - The measure of damages for the breach of the official bond of a sheriff is ordinarily the amount of injury actually sustained, including the reasonable expenses of the suit thereon and the costs of court.

<p class="p4"><b>No need to show bad faith for recovery of attorney's fees.</b> - In a case arising under this section, it is unnecessary to show bad faith, or the like, as a condition to the recovery of attorney's fees.

<p class="p4">In a suit on a bond of a public officer for official misconduct, it is unnecessary to show bad faith or the like as a condition to the recovery of attorney's fees, as is generally required in contract actions by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 20-1404 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County not entitled to recover attorney's fees.</b> - Since it was not shown by the evidence that the county suffered any injury or loss because of having to pay attorney's fees, the county was not entitled to recover attorney's fees under<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this section. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. v. Floyd County, 178 Ga. 595, 173 S.E. 720 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What amounts to bad faith.</b> - Any arbitrary omission by the officer to do that which is required of the officer by law, or any conscious disregard of the limitation upon the officer's authority, would amount to bad faith within the meaning of that term as employed in this section. Copeland v. Dunehoo, 36 Ga. App. 817, 138 S.E. 267 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Recovery of reasonable expenses as well as exemplary damages.</b> - This section is susceptible of the construction that when exemplary damages are awarded there can still be a recovery for the reasonable expenses of the suit to the plaintiff, which necessarily includes attorney's fees.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Instructions not prejudicial to defendant.</b> - It is not prejudicial to the defendant for the court to charge the jury that to authorize a recovery for punitive or exemplary damages the jury must be satisfied that there was some wilful misconduct on the part of the officers, or that entire want of care by them which would give rise to the presumption of a conscious indifference to consequence, and that there must be evidence satisfactory to the jury either of malicious wantonness or of an oppression by the officers as against the plaintiff.

<p class="p4"><b>Past offers to resign not continuing offers.</b> - A recital that a named officer on different occasions "has stated to me, as Governor of Georgia, that if I desired to accept his resignation I could do so, and that he would 'go home,' " does not show a resignation, but merely discloses past offers to resign if the Governor then so desired. The statements so ascribed to the officer were not continuing offers, conditional or otherwise, and did not authorize future action thereon by the Governor. Patten v.

<p class="p4"><b>Facts not constituting a resignation.</b> - When an order of the Governor contained a specific recital of facts to show a resignation, and it appeared that the facts did not constitute a resignation in law, a declaration in the Governor's order that "the resignation aforesaid . . . is hereby accepted" does not show a vacancy created by the acceptance of a resignation.

<p class="p4"><b>Vacancy created by suspension of officer.</b> - A county board of education had the right to suspend the county superintendent of schools for the commission of a crime involving moral turpitude. If convicted of the charge, such official would lose all rights to the office to which the official had been elected. If acquitted, the official might serve the remainder of the term for which elected. Parkerson v. Hart, 200 Ga. 660, 38 S.E.2d 397 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Change in residence by a county commissioner.</b> - Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-5-1(5) is applicable to county commissioners, when the commissioners are elected from districts by the entire electorate of the county their office is not vacated by removing their residence from the area from which they were elected and into another area of the county, in the absence of such a specific provision of the local Act creating the board.

<p class="p4"><b>Vacancy created by failure to file official bond.</b> - When an election for Commissioner of Roads and Revenues for Madison County, a legislative office, was held in November, at which an incumbent was reelected to such office, it was the incumbent's duty to file an official bond with the ordinary on or before January 1; and, upon the incumbent's own personal failure to do so, a vacancy in the office resulted.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Due process requirements for removal for misconduct.</b> - Under this section, a mere charge of misconduct in office on the part of the incumbent does not show abandonment; nor may the Governor, against the will of the incumbent, declare a vacancy upon any theory of abandonment until the fact is ascertained in a judicial proceeding. Patten v. Miller, 190 Ga. 123, 8 S.E.2d 757 (1940); Partain v. Maddox, 227 Ga. 623, 182 S.E.2d 450 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Abandonment caused by acquiescence in wrongful removal.</b> - While acquiescence may be entirely different from abandonment, the abandonment of a public office may result from an acquiescence by the officer in wrongful removal or discharge; after a summary removal, an unreasonable delay by an officer illegally removed in taking steps to vindicate rights may constitute an abandonment of the office, and the voluntary surrender of an office to another because of the erroneous belief that such other has been duly elected as successor to the surrendering officer may constitute an abandonment.

<p class="p4"><b>Quo warranto denied challenging appointment of judges.</b> - Trial court's denial of the challenger's petition for a writ of quo warranto was affirmed because the newly created positions on the Georgia Court of Appeals qualified as vacancies under Ga.

<p class="p8"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>No vacancy created by incumbent holding over.</b> - Since none of the seven grounds mentioned in this section exist in the case of a hold-over, there is no vacancy in the office and the incumbent can legally perform the duties of the office until the incumbent's successor is appointed and qualified. 1963-65 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 216.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Withdrawal of resignation.</b> - Unless a resignation is meant to be effective immediately (which a tender would not seem to be), it may be withdrawn before acceptance. 1963-65 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 581.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illness of officer as ground for vacancy.</b> - While illness of the officer is not specifically enumerated in the Georgia statute, in all probability the permanent illness of the officer might be construed by the Georgia courts to bring about a vacancy on the ground of incapacity; since it has been held that temporary imprisonment does not incapacitate, neither does temporary illness incapacitate for office. 1954-56 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 204.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State court judge must continue to maintain residency in county</b> from which the judge is elected in order to retain the judge office and, if the judge fails to do so, then the office becomes vacant as a matter of law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1995 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U95-6.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determination of vacancy in office of justice of the peace.</b> - Absence from the state, without change of residence, does not vacate the office of justice of the peace until the vacancy has been judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, but change of residence to another state vacates the office. 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 79. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of member of county board of education living within city limits.</b> - Members of a county board of education who because of an extension of the corporate limits of a city, find themselves residing within the territorial boundaries of an independent public school district, do not lose their membership on such board of education; they continue to hold office until removed by quo warranto proceedings. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 101.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of county officer leaving area represented.</b> - Construing this section, a county officer legally elected to office who thereafter leaves from the geographical area represented does not ipso facto cease to hold such office, but is at least a "de facto" officer, and so remains until there is a judicial ascertainment of that fact; the rule is otherwise when the officer moves outside the state. 1954-56 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 71; 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 101. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A member of the county board of education does not become disqualified merely by moving into another militia district, unless another member of that county board also resides in that militia district, or unless an independent school system is located therein. 1952-53 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 64.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Elected at-large official moving from district qualified from.</b> - A county commissioner, who qualifies from a particular district in a county and is elected at-large, who moves residence from the district from which the commissioner qualified to another district in the county does not create a vacancy in that office. 1985 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 85-36.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relinquishment of rights as member of state board.</b> - A member of a state board who has not protested the eligibility of one elected to succeed that member, and who has yet failed to attend the regular meetings of the board, has relinquished rights as a member. 1948-49 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 214.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>City not liable on void contract.</b> - A municipality cannot be held liable upon an implied contract for the value of any benefits received by it under a contract made with one of its officials when the municipality is expressly forbidden to make such a contract; such a contract, being void, cannot be ratified by an acceptance or use by the municipality of the benefits furnished thereunder.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lien on property acquired by city at tax sale.</b> - The title acquired by a city at a tax sale is the same as that any individual would have obtained; that is, it obtains title subject to the lien of the special assessment. It is authorized to convey no better title than it holds. It may not by merely reselling the property divest the lien of the assessment; for to allow this would provide a method for vitiating the provision making this lien "coequal" with the lien of other taxes.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Settlement agreement enforceable.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a property owner's motion for summary judgment in a county breach of contract action because a settlement agreement between the parties was enforceable; the county attorney had authority to make the settlement offer on behalf of the county board, and while a vote in a public meeting was a required formality to effectuate the purchase, the board's failure to complete that formality when voting in the public meeting could not destroy an already existing settlement agreement.

<p class="p4"><b>Ultra vires contract not enforceable under quantum meruit theory of recovery.</b> - Appellate court erred by holding that an environmental engineering company could recover against a city on the company's quantum meruit claim because quantum meruit was not an available remedy against the city since the claim was based on a municipal contract that was ultra vires as the contract was never approved by city council.

<p class="p4"><b>"Unconferred power" refers to powers of municipality rather than officer.</b> - Except when the municipality's ability to exercise its governmental powers is itself threatened by the unauthorized action of a municipal officer, the term "unconferred power" as used in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-6-5 has traditionally been interpreted as referring to the powers of the municipality rather than the powers of the officer. Star Laundry, Inc. v. City of Warner Robins, 189 Ga. App. 839, 377 S.E.2d 709, rev'd on other grounds, 259 Ga. 348, 381 S.E.2d 38 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">The trial court properly entered judgment n.o.v. against plaintiffs, golf professionals who alleged that they had an oral contract with a city to provide services on the city's golf courses, which contract was breached when the golf courses were leased to another, since the plaintiffs failed to show that the alleged contract was authorized. Cole v. City of Atlanta, 195 Ga. App. 67, 392 S.E.2d 283 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>City attorneys are public officers</b> within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-6-5 and plaintiffs in an action against the city had a duty to apprise themselves of the attorneys' capacity to bind the city to a settlement contract; even though an express restriction on a city attorney's right to settle a cause of action, embodied in a municipal ordinance, was not communicated by the city or its attorney to plaintiffs, they were presumptively charged with knowledge of the ordinance. Black v. City of Atlanta, 61 F.3d 27 (11th Cir. 1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in charging jury that the city attorney, as the city's agent, bound the city through the attorney's conduct, as the charge contained a correct statement of the law pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-6-5 and the city failed to point to a specific limitation on the city attorney's authority that would have required a different charge under the facts and theories of the case.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegation of agency insufficient.</b> - While generally an allegation of agency is sufficient to withstand both general and special demurrer (now motion to dismiss), such is not true in cases involving the powers and duties of public officials when the agent is without authority of law to act. Ingalls Iron Works Co. v. City of Forest Park, 99 Ga. App. 706, 109 S.E.2d 835 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">County administrator incorrectly advised a former county employee that the employee would start receiving retirement benefits in nine years. As the administrator disregarded and deviated from the terms of the county retirement plan, rather than simply making a mistake during an otherwise authorized action under the plan, the administrator engaged in an ultra vires action that could not support the employee's promissory estoppel claim under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-3-44(a).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>City cannot compel general contractor to enter into subcontract with particular company.</b> - Company listed as a "potential subcontractor" in a bid on a contract with a city could not reasonably rely on city officials' assertions that the city could, on the basis of the listing, compel the general contractor to enter into the subcontract with the company, since city officials cannot establish a duty on the part of the city when none exists by law. Southeast Grading, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 172 Ga. App. 798, 324 S.E.2d 776 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>City attorney's authority limited by ordinance.</b> - A public sector attorney's authority, like that of any other public officer, is defined and prescribed by law, including municipal ordinances; thus, a city and police officers who had entered a settlement agreement executed by city attorneys on their behalf were not estopped from challenging the agreement on the basis that a city ordinance restricted the apparent authority of the attorneys to execute the agreement, even though the ordinance was not specifically communicated to the opposing party. City of Atlanta v. Black, 265 Ga. 425, 457 S.E.2d 551 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actions by county attorney can bind county.</b> - Although a county attorney did not have plenary authority over a matter involving a property owner's erection of a sign that exceeded the zoning height limitations and should have sought the approval of the County Board of Commissioners prior to entering into a consent order with respect to the dispute, the county was bound by the order after the attorney asserted that the attorney had the power and authority to enter the order and it was in the interests of public policy. Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-6-5 does not confer plenary settlement authority over a public sector attorney, the attorney's actions in the circumstances justified the imposition of the attorney's actions on the county. DeKalb County v. DRS Invs., Inc., 260 Ga. App. 225, 581 S.E.2d 573 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Individual employees cannot bind city without approval.</b> - Actions of individual city officials who are not empowered to act on behalf of the city cannot be relied upon by others to commit the government's resources, regardless of good intentions; thus, to the extent that Walston &amp; Assoc. v. City of Atlanta, 224 Ga. App. at 484 (1997); City of Dallas v. White, 182 Ga. App. at 783 (1987); and City of St. Marys v. Stottler Stagg &amp; Assoc., 163 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Promulgation of rules.</b> - Even if a state department employee manual given to all employees did purport to establish procedural protections for employees, its promulgation was beyond the authority of the director of the department and could not bind the city.

<p class="p4">Since the transfer of a prisoner was not made pursuant to any order of court, being the result of some informal arrangement between the state and federal officers, it is immaterial that the state officers may have acted improperly in this matter, since the state would not be bound by the act of such officers in releasing the prisoner without authority of law and the case is the same as though the prisoner had escaped from the custody of the state officers. Jordan v. State, 41 Ga. App. 779, 154 S.E. 725 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Because a mayor lacked authority to unilaterally bind the town to a contract with the contractor, any contract based on an authorization from the mayor was unauthorized; this foreclosed the contractor from asserting estoppel against the town.

<p class="p4"><b>Unauthorized waiver of sovereign immunity.</b> - The compensation of some other person or persons for comparable injuries on the same county property, or the purchase of insurance for such purposes, does not create a cause of action in a plaintiff suing a city in a tort action.

<p class="p4"><b>Officer not entitled to rely on estoppel.</b> - Board's action in rescinding a retired officer's prior credited service was not a recalculation, but an annulment of an entitlement that had no legal basis and was thus proper. The retired officer's entitlement to the prior service credit never vested, so the board lacked any power which was expressly conferred by law to award the pension based on that prior service, and the retired officer was not entitled to relief under the doctrine of estoppel.

<p class="p4"><b>Especially concerning the expenditure of public funds.</b> - An appropriate starting point for any discussion of whether or not a public board or officer in Georgia is legally authorized to take a given action is the observation that the powers of public boards and officers are limited in this state to those defined by law, a rule which is of especial force when the questioned power relates to an expenditure of public funds; it has been said to justify such an expenditure there must be a provision of law clearly providing for or authorizing the expenditure. 1977 Op.

Per diem differential shall be paid by the legislative fiscal office to the member upon the member's notification to the legislative fiscal office of the days for which the daily expense allowance was received for which the member wishes to claim the per diem differential, and the legislative fiscal office shall keep a record of the days for which per diem differential is so claimed and paid. <br>

No reimbursement shall be made on any voucher or claim submitted after that date. Any amounts remaining in such expense account at the end of the first year of the two-year biennium may be claimed for expenses incurred during the second year of the two-year biennium. Any amounts remaining in any expense account which are not so claimed by April 15 of the year following the second year of the biennium and any amounts claimed which are returned as hereafter provided for in this paragraph shall lapse and shall be remitted by the legislative fiscal office to the general fund of the state treasury. Any former member of the General Assembly may be reimbursed for expenses incurred while a member of the General Assembly upon compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.

This penalty and award of attorneys' fees may also be imposed upon the surety by any court acquiring jurisdiction of the subject matter, in the event it is shown that the surety has acted in bad faith and has been vexatiously litigious or that it has filed defensive proceedings for delay only.

In the absence of specific statutory or contractual requirement it is only necessary to constitute a demand that the surety be notified that immediate payment of the debt is requested. There is no requirement here of demand on the principal to initiate the running of interest against the principal, and the evident purpose of the statutory requirement of demand on the surety is to give such surety an opportunity to immediately reimburse the county for any loss within the terms of the bond occasioned by the breach of principal, without subjecting it to the payment of interest prior to the time the county notifies it that immediate payment of such obligation is requested.

<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof shifted to officer cited in execution.</b> - The law presumes, when a fi. fa. is issued against a county tax collector, that the amount named therein is due by the officer, and the burden is on the tax collector to show that the fi. fa. is invalid or inoperative in whole or in part, notwithstanding any provision in this section. When the fi. fa. is introduced in evidence, the burden of proof shifts from the official issuing the execution to the tax collector. Adamson v.

<p class="p10">When any officer to whom this chapter relates shall succeed himself in office or has been elected to succeed himself in office or has been elected to succeed himself in a subsequent term, such officer or the surety on his bond either for the current term or for the term which has or shall have expired, or for a term about to begin, may file with the official or the county or municipal authority having jurisdiction to cite for accounting a petition asking that an accounting be had as to the acts of such officer during the term which has ended or is about to end. Such official or county or municipal authority shall then cause a citation to issue and be served on the officer and the sureties on his bonds for both terms, except such of them as shall be party to or join in the petition; and such further proceedings shall be had as are provided for in Code Section 45-8-20 in cases of citation for accounting. In the order or judgment rendered by the official or county or municipal authority conducting the accounting, or, in case of appeal, in the judgment of the court, the condition of the accounts of such officers shall be stated as between the two terms and as between the sureties for the respective terms; and the order or judgment shall set the terms upon compliance with which the sureties on the bond for the expired or expiring term shall be discharged or liability as to taxes, revenues, and public moneys satisfied; and it shall also settle and determine between the sureties in the respective bonds the matters for which each is or may be liable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The commissioner may provide for endorsements for contractual liability and, where necessary or convenient to the public functions of the state, the commissioner may also provide for additional insureds. In such event, the commissioner may alternatively retain all moneys paid to the Department of Administrative Services as premiums on such policies of liability insurance or contracts of indemnity, all moneys received as interest, and all moneys received from other sources to set up and maintain a reserve fund for the payment of such liability under, and the expenses necessary to administer properly, a self-insurance program. If the commissioner decides to institute a self-insurance program, the commissioner shall establish and maintain a reserve fund for the payment of liabilities arising out of claims against officers, officials, and employees of the state and for any additional insureds. The commissioner shall also charge to state entities such premiums, deductibles, and other payments taking into account any direct appropriations as shall be necessary to maintain the soundness of the insurance or self-insurance programs established under this Code section. The commissioner is further authorized to establish incentive programs, including differential premium rates based on participation in loss control programs established by the department, increased or decreased deductibles based on participation in loss control programs established by the department, and the imposition of fines and penalties. If any premiums, deductibles, fines, or penalties are unpaid, the department is authorized to deduct any unpaid amounts from the nonpaying agency's or authority's continuation budget subject to the approval of the Office of Planning and Budget and deposit those funds into the liability trust fund provided for in this Code section. Any amounts held by the commissioner which are available for investment shall be paid over to the Office of the State Treasurer. The state treasurer shall deposit such funds in a trust account for credit only to the self-insurance program. The state treasurer shall invest these funds subject to the limitations of Code Section 50-5A-7 and Chapter 17 of Title 50. All income derived from such investments shall accrue to the self-insurance program. When moneys are paid over to the Office of the State Treasurer, as provided in this subsection, the commissioner shall submit an estimate of the date such funds shall no longer be available for investment. When the commissioner wishes to withdraw funds from the trust account provided for in this Code section, he or she shall submit a request for such withdrawal, in writing, to the state treasurer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

However, the commissioner shall incur no obligation beyond the funds then available for commitment to the obligation.

<p class="p4"><b>Waiver of sovereign immunity.</b> - Establishment of comprehensive general liability trust fund for Department of Public Safety employees, covering negligence in performance of official acts, constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity to the extent of the available insurance in the case of an accident resulting from a high-speed chase by police. Martin v. Georgia Dep't of Pub. Safety, 257 Ga. 300, 357 S.E.2d 569 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 998, 108 S. Ct. 685, 98 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-9-5 expresses a legislative intent that sovereign immunity of the state is not to be waived through the furnishing of insurance authorized by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-9-4, the language of the Constitution (Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Para. IX) forces the court to reach a contrary result. Price v. Department of Transp., 257 Ga. 537, 361 S.E.2d 146 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fired state employee's monetary claims against a state agency in federal court under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1981 were dismissed because the General Assembly had not waived its sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment by enacting the Fair Employment Practices Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-9-5, which permitted a state agency to purchase insurance on behalf of the agency's employees; passage of <span class="s1">§</span> 45-9-5did not amount to the State of Georgia's waiver of the state's sovereign immunity in federal court because sovereign immunity could never be implicitly waived.

<p class="p4"><b>City not required to defend employees.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-9-21 does not "require" the city to defend any civil action against its employees, but merely permits it to do so, pursuant to an adopted policy, as a part of the compensation paid by the employer to the employee. Horn v. City of Atlanta, 236 Ga. 247, 223 S.E.2d 647 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion in selecting what actions to defend.</b> - The phrase "in their discretion" indicates a legislative intent to give counties considerable latitude in determining what actions will be defended.

Haywood v. Hughes, 238 Ga. 668, 235 S.E.2d 2 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a local ordinance provided defense and indemnification to county employees who were the subject of lawsuits, but such coverage could be terminated by the county attorney, there was no abuse of discretion found by the county attorney's termination of an employee's coverage since the employee gave inaccurate or false responses to interrogatories and deposition questions regarding a prior position that the employee held; pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-9-21(a), the county attorney's decision was based on a reasoned, articulated basis, the omission by the employee was deemed material, and it was determined that the information was deliberately withheld.

<p class="p4"><b>Employment of counsel.</b> - A county governing authority has the implicit power to employ counsel for county officers. Stephenson v. Board of Comm'rs, 261 Ga. 399, 405 S.E.2d 488 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">County governing authority's employment of counsel to represent a superior court clerk did not violate Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. II, Paras. I(c)(1) or (7), which preclude the authority from exercising any power in a manner affecting "any elective county office" or "any court or the personnel thereof." Stephenson v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County's duty to pay attorney fees.</b> - When an official, acting in official capacity, is required to hire outside counsel to assert a legal position the local government attorney cannot (because of a conflict in representing the local government) or will not assert, and the official is successful in asserting his or her position, the local government must pay the official's attorney fees. Haralson County v. Kimball, 243 Ga. App. 559, 533 S.E.2d 762 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statutory law authorized local governments and other "public bodies" to adopt employment policies whereby the local government agreed to provide representation to the local government's employees if a conflict of interest existed and the matter did not involve property or money in which the governmental unit had an interest; since the sheriff was a local governmental unit employee who the trial court properly certified had a conflict of interest over the county commission's adoption of a budget that harmed the sheriff's department and that matter did not involve the government's property or money, the trial court properly ruled that the sheriff had a right to have counsel appointed for the sheriff, and have the sheriff's attorney's fees and expenses paid, on the sheriff's challenge to that budget.

<p class="p4"><b>General rule concerning extent of public officer's immunity.</b> - It is the general rule that public officers, when acting in good faith and within the scope of their duty, are not liable to private action, but this immunity is not extended to them when they do things not authorized by law, or act in a wanton or malicious way and with intent to injure the property of another.

<p class="p4"><b>General rule concerning county immunity.</b> - It is the general rule that a county when exercising governmental functions and acting as an agency of the state is not liable, in the absence of a statute imposing liability, for its failure to perform a duty or for its negligent performance of the duty, not even when the duty is imposed by statute; and there is no distinction in the application of this rule between the neglect to perform an act which ought to have been performed, and the performance of the duty in a negligent manner.

<p class="p4"><b>Removal from office.</b> - A city commissioner's removal from office, based on acts committed prior to taking office, was erroneous because: (1) removal was not authorized by the city's charter; (2) the commissioner's conduct of maintaining innocence until the entry of a guilty plea after taking office was not an official act or one done under the color of the office; (3) the acts committed did not prevent the commissioner from performing the duties of that post; and (4) the commissioner was not guilty of evading the law after becoming a member of the commission. Ciccio v. City of Hephzibah, 289 Ga. App. 134, 656 S.E.2d 245 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C0862, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 474 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No duty on board to put citizen on agenda.</b> - A citizen was not entitled to a writ of mandamus directing a school board to place the citizen on the board's agenda because setting the agenda was a discretionary act that was not subject to mandamus and none of the statutes cited by the citizen, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 20-2-1160(a), 45-10-1 and 50-6-6(b), imposed a duty on the board to place the citizen on the board's agenda.

<p class="p4"><b>Funeral service inspectors as trade association officers.</b> - State Board of Funeral Service inspectors appointed pursuant to O.C.G.A. Title 43, Chapter 18 are not prohibited by state law from holding appointed or elected office in private associations of funeral service practitioners. However, serving as an officer in such private association could create an appearance of impropriety by competing loyalties which may be owed to the association and to the board. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Representation by lawyer/legislator.</b> - Lawyer/legislator may represent the legal interests of a Georgia company on matters in other states, including political consulting and the drafting of legislation. However, even if there may not be a per se conflict of interest, a lawyer/legislator must always vigilantly guard against such conflicts developing depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation, especially when matters arise involving the lawyer/legislator's own actions in the consideration of legislation within the General Assembly. 2009 Op.

III), was designed for the prevention of surreptitious legislation, and the prevention of "omnibus" bills containing many adverse matters; although it is not required that the title of an act contain an exact synopsis of the law itself, it is required that the matter following the enacting clause be definitely related to what is expressed in the title, and have a natural connection to the main object of the legislation; therefore, the courts could rule the Act comprised of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 45-10-3 through 45-10-5, which Act imposes a general code of ethics on members of the Board of Human Resources and purports to take away the rule making authority of all boards, commissions, and authorities of state government, constitutionally defective (but other interpretations may militate against such construction). 1976 Op.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is essential to the proper operation of democratic government that public officials be independent and impartial, that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure, that public office not be used for private gain other than the remuneration provided by law, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of government. The attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists a conflict between the private interests of an elected official or a government employee and his duties as such. The public interest, therefore, requires that the law protect against such conflicts of interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of elected officials and government employees in situations where conflicts exist. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the government of those men and women who are best qualified to serve it. An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly declares that the operation of responsible democratic government requires that the fullest opportunity be afforded to the people to petition their government for the redress of grievances and to express freely to individual members of the General Assembly, to committees of the General Assembly, and to officials of the executive branch their opinions on legislation, on pending executive actions, and on current issues and that, to preserve and maintain the integrity of the legislative and administrative processes, it is necessary that the identity, expenditures, and activities of certain persons who engage in efforts to persuade members of the General Assembly or the executive branch to take specific actions, either by direct communication to such officials, or by solicitation of others to engage in such efforts, be publicly and regularly disclosed. The provisions of this article shall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure of such information so as to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the policy and purpose of this article to implement these objectives of protecting the integrity of all governmental units of this state and of facilitating the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel by prescribing essential restrictions against conflicts of interest in state government without creating unnecessary barriers to the public service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - The constitutionality of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 has been upheld, on the reasoning that public officials, who are peculiarly subject to complaint as to performance of their duties, may appear before the grand jury in the interest of preventing indictment on frivolous accusations. Mapp v. State, 204 Ga. App. 647, 420 S.E.2d 615 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 45-11-4 not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite.</b> - This section is not unconstitutional for the reason that the expression "malpractice in office" is too vague and indefinite to apprise the defendant of the conduct proscribed by that section because the expression is made sufficiently definite by construing the section in connection with the laws defining the official's duties. Steele v. State, 227 Ga. 653, 182 S.E.2d 475 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The question as to whether malpractice has been committed can only be answered by considering the laws defining the particular official's duties along with the malpractice statute; only by reading those provisions into this section is it made sufficiently definite to satisfy the requirements of a valid penal statute. Cargile v. State, 67 Ga. App. 610, 21 S.E.2d 326 (1942); Phillips v. State, 127 Ga. App. 499, 194 S.E.2d 278 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No equal protection violation.</b> - Conspiracy to commit murder is in no way similar to any crime for which a public officer would be entitled to appear before a grand jury; and thus this section does not violate the equal protection rights of a defendant so charged, under either the federal or the state Constitution. Orkin v. State, 236 Ga. 176, 223 S.E.2d 61 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4, by affording only certain enumerated officials the privilege of appearing before the grand jury prior to indictment, does not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. State v. Deason, 259 Ga. 183, 378 S.E.2d 120 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No equal protection or due process violation.</b> - Because peace officers must make split second decisions regarding the safety of themselves and others and public officials decisions are generally deliberative, there was a rational basis for treating the two differently and, thus, there was no equal protection or due process violation due to the manner in which O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 classified the two groups. Ellis v. State, 300 Ga. 371, 794 S.E.2d 601 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>45-11-4. - It is apparent that the legislature intended by this enactment to require faithfulness to public trust upon the part of the officials therein named. To secure this conduct the officials not only are required to perform the acts required of them by law, but are equally forbidden to commit under the color of office acts not authorized by law. Cargile v. State, 67 Ga. App. 610, 21 S.E.2d 326 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 furthers the legitimate state interest of protecting certain government officials, vested with the authority to exercise discretion, against possible frivolous indictments pursued by persons aggrieved by the exercise of that discretion because the legislative rationale is that, if these officials do not have such protection, their reputation and performance of their duties could be compromised while they are defending baseless charges; by enacting O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-7-52, the General Assembly intended to afford peace officers the enhanced protections given to other public officials regarding accusations arising from the performance or nonperformance of their official duties, and thus, the legitimate purpose of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-7-52, in conjunction with <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4, is to protect peace officers from harassing or frivolous charges before the grand jury. State v. Smith, 286 Ga. 409, 688 S.E.2d 348 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§§</b></span><b> 17-7-52 and </b>45-11-4. - Trial court erred by holding that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 17-7-52(a) and 45-11-4(g) did not apply as there was substantial evidence that the defendant entered the sheriff's office in furtherance of an investigation while the defendant was arguably on call on the night of the sheriff's death. Yancey v. State, 342 Ga. App. 294, 802 S.E.2d 702 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grand jury power not limited.</b> - It was not the intention to limit the power of the grand jury to cases in which there should be a prosecutor. Groves v. State, 73 Ga. 205 (1884). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4(g), a public officer who was accused of unprofessional conduct had the right to appear before the grand jury to make such sworn statement as desired at the conclusion of the presentation of the state's evidence; however, a public official who was the topic of a critical grand jury presentment did not have any right to maintain the secrecy of the document in circumstances in which, contrary to the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-12-80, the grand jury caused the premature release of its presentments by giving them to the county attorney, before presenting them to the superior court for publication. Decatur County v. Bainbridge Post Searchlight, Inc., 280 Ga. 706, 632 S.E.2d 113 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rational basis for special protection of officials.</b> - The dual dangers that the grand jury will be influenced by extra-legal, political considerations to return an unfounded indictment against a public official and that such indictment will cause disrespect of the public office are legitimate concerns of the state, providing a rational basis on which it could provide special protection from unfounded malfeasance in office charges or indictments of its commissioned officials, county judges, justices of the peace, and county commissioners. The procedures of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 are the means of effecting this policy. Sweeney v. Balkcom, 358 F.2d 415 (5th Cir. 1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cumulative methods for removal.</b> - The constitutional and legislative method for removing officers do not conflict with this section, they are cumulative. Kent v. State, 18 Ga. App. 30, 88 S.E. 913 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A special law for the removal of certain county commissioners</b> by the judge of the superior court is not invalid as controverting this section. Smith v. Duggan, 153 Ga. 463, 112 S.E. 458 (1922).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Punishment upon conviction.</b> - This section means that any of the officers charged with the offense therein named shall, upon a legal conviction in a court having jurisdiction, be punished as for a misdemeanor and removed from office. Cargile v. State, 194 Ga. 20, 20 S.E.2d 416, answer conformed to, 67 Ga. App. 610, 21 S.E.2d 326 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Peace officers.</b> - When the General Assembly modified O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 in 1990 to make plain that its protections encompassed those formerly in office, it fully realized that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-7-52 mandated that such protections be extended to peace officers. Dudley v. State, 273 Ga. 466, 542 S.E.2d 99 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the defendant quashed the indictment against the defendant due to the state's failure to allow the defendant to appear before the grand jury as was the defendant's right as a police officer under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 17-7-52 and <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4, the state did not appeal as was the state's right under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(1); the state instead obtained an accusation against the defendant, and the trial court quashed the accusation due to the state's failure to allow the defendant to appear before the grand jury, thus, the state could not argue, in opposing the defendant's motion to quash the accusation, that the defendant was not performing the defendant's official duties at the time of the alleged criminal conduct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, since the trial court had previously decided this issue against the defendant, res judicata under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-12-40 barred further litigation of the issue. State v. Allen, 262 Ga. App. 724, 586 S.E.2d 378 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 45-11-4 applicable only to probate judges, county commissioners, and justices of the peace.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 does not appear to apply to all government employees per se, but to probate judges, county commissioners, and justices of the peace who are charged with malpractice in office. Wages v. State, 165 Ga. App. 587, 302 S.E.2d 112 (1983) (decided prior to the 1983 amendment, which deleted the reference to justices of the peace, prior to the 1988 amendment, which made O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 also applicable to mayors and members of municipal governing authorities and prior to the 1990 amendment, which, in part, further broadened the applicability of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>County commissioners and notaries public.</b> - This section applies to county commissioners, and since notaries public are ex officio justices of the peace notaries are also included in this section.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 45-11-4 inapplicable to official resigning position prior to indictment.</b> - As O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 applies to state officials, a court clerk who resigned post prior to the institution of any proceedings against the clerk is not covered. To be eligible for the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4, a party must be a state official when an indictment is presented. Axson v. State, 174 Ga. App. 236, 329 S.E.2d 566 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since a defendant was an investigator for the district attorney when the criminal acts at issue occurred, but had been discharged from that position prior to indictment, there was no merit in the defendant's argument that the protections of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-7-52 and <span class="s1">§</span> 45-11-4 should be extended to one who is charged with official misdeeds but who is no longer employed as a government official or peace officer when proceedings against that former official are commenced.

<p class="p4"><b>No special privileges for officer charged with crime.</b> - When the special presentment in a conspiracy to defraud a county case does not charge a superior court judge with malfeasance or malpractice in office, the judge was not entitled, merely by virtue of the fact of occupying a high office in the state, to the special privileges accorded the holders of such offices under the provisions of this section.

Under these circumstances, the fact that the indictment alleges, or in proving the crime charged the proof would show, that in committing the crime charged the defendant committed an act which would constitute malpractice in office would not make the indictment one so charging defendant under this section.

<p class="p4"><b>Comptroller General is not authorized to draw a warrant upon the State Treasurer</b> (now director of the Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services). Irons v. Harrison, 185 Ga. 244, 194 S.E. 749 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment from specified account.</b> - A warrant drawn by the Governor upon the State Treasurer (now director of the Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services) directing the latter to place the amount of such warrant "to the account of the school fund," is payable out of that fund as derived from the sources authorized by the constitution and the law; and it is not only the right but the duty of the State Treasurer (now director of the Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services) to so construe such a warrant. Park v. Candler, 113 Ga. 647, 39 S.E. 89 (1901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocability of warrant.</b> - An executive warrant upon the treasury of the state, authorizing the payment of money in pursuance of an appropriation made by law, is not a contract nor in the nature of a contract, but is only a license or power, and is revocable so long as the payment which it warranted has not been made. Fletcher v. Renfroe, 56 Ga. 674 (1876). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If revocation cannot take place by the separate act of the Governor, it can take place by the joint act of the Governor and the General Assembly; and a resolution passed by both houses and approved by the Governor, instructing the State Treasurer (now director of the Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services) not to pay a warrant, is a virtual revocation.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extent of power.</b> - This section does not confer upon the Governor the power to compromise or release a corporation from an ad valorem tax; the Governor can do no more than suspend the tax until the meeting of the next General Assembly.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion to suspend collection of taxes.</b> - The Governor under this section is given broad discretionary power to suspend the collection of taxes or any part thereof due the state until the next meeting of the General Assembly after such suspension. 1950-51 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 424.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No authority to extinguish tax liability.</b> - This section assumes that a tax liability has lawfully accrued and that taxes are legally due the state, and the Governor has no authority to extinguish this liability; the extent of the Governor's power is to suspend the collection of it until the meeting of the next General Assembly. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 360. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under the provisions of this section, a Governor has the authority to suspend the collection of taxes until the next session of the General Assembly but is not authorized to relieve the taxpayer from any tax liability; the grant of an exemption from taxation is a legislative function which can only be exercised by the General Assembly. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-23.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere postponement of due date for taxes.</b> - The suspension of taxes under this section is really just a postponement of the date upon which taxes become due and are payable. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-23.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure of legislature to ratify suspension order.</b> - When the collection of taxes is suspended by the Governor's executive order, under this section, until the next meeting of the General Assembly, and at the next meeting of the General Assembly such executive order fails of ratification, the taxes which would otherwise have been due and collectible thereupon become due and payable. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 360. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The General Assembly may ratify the Governor's order and make the relief permanent, but if legislative ratification is not forthcoming at the meeting of the next General Assembly the effect of the Governor's order of suspension, by the express language of the statute, terminates, leaving the taxpayer exposed to, and without any relief against, the usual processes of the collection of what had all the time been a legal liability for the taxes. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 360.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suspension order in effect until adjournment of legislature.</b> - An executive order or suspension is terminated by operation of law upon the failure or refusal of the General Assembly to ratify it at its next meeting after the date of the issuance of the executive order since the General Assembly might ratify the order by proper legislation at any time prior to its adjournment, it must be considered that the order remained in effect until the final adjournment. 1952-53 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of suspension order by succeeding Governor.</b> - When the collection of taxes is suspended by the Governor's executive order under this section, and prior to submission of the matter to the next General Assembly a succeeding Governor revokes such executive order, the taxes which would otherwise have been due and collectible during the period of such executive order thereupon become due and payable. 1958-59 Op.

The person designated to perform the duties of the Commissioner of Insurance shall not receive any compensation in addition to that he was, or is, receiving as clerk, but any expense incurred in furnishing the bond required by this Code section and Code Section 45-12-24 shall be borne by the state. When the person designated under authority of this Code section and Code Section 45-12-24 shall have given the bond required and said bond has been approved as required, he shall be authorized to do everything, perform every act, and exercise every prerogative or discretion that the Commissioner of Insurance might do, perform, or exercise under existing law in the absence of his incapacity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power to spend appropriated funds.</b> - The actual power of a public agency to spend public money for particular activities or purposes must be pursuant to a general law, not an appropriation Act. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-80.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Appropriation by General Assembly to unit of organization.</b> - The term "budget unit" does not depend upon whether the General Assembly appropriates money to a unit of organization defined only by the General Appropriations Act; a budget unit is a unit of organization to which appropriations may be made separate from an appropriation to any other unit of organization; whether the General Assembly may do so depends upon whether the unit of organization has authority under general law, independent of the authority of any other unit of organization under general law, to spend public funds. 1974 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proceeds from sales of unserviceable property must be deposited.</b> - Proceeds of property sales may constitutionally be retained by the agency concerned, because such proceeds are not "taxes," "fees" or "assessments." As a matter of statute, however, most such proceeds must be paid into the state treasury: first, such proceeds would in general constitute "other moneys" within the meaning of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 40-423 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-12-92); and second, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 91-804 (see former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-16-144) provided that the proceeds of sales of unserviceable property shall be paid into the treasury. 1977 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revenue transferred from another agency need not be deposited into state treasury.</b> - The constitutional and statutory provisions when the provisions speak of revenues refer to outside receipts; revenues which are received by one agency from another agency, unlike outside receipts, are already subject to the annual appropriations process; therefore, such revenues need not be deposited into the state treasury to ensure that the General Assembly can exercise control over state finances. 1977 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Certain income generated by judicial branch need not be deposited into state treasury.</b> - Certain income generated by the judicial branch of government, including dues paid by members of the State Bar of Georgia, fees paid to the office of bar admissions by applicants for admission to the bar, and fees paid by court reporters to the board of court reporting of the Judicial Counsel, may be retained by the judicial branch. 1977 Op.

The Attorney General is authorized to determine the title and to change the title of any attorney or other employee of the Department of Law or any attorney at law under independent contract to the Department of Law in order to define the duties and responsibilities of any attorney or other employee of the said department and to establish salaries and effect promotions of any such attorney or other employee of the said department, except that those positions in the department which are within the classified service on April 18, 1975, shall be covered by the procedures prescribed by the State Personnel Board. Neither the Attorney General nor any other attorney at law employed full time by the Department of Law shall engage in the private practice of law during his or her term of appointment. Attorneys at law under independent contract to the Department of Law may engage in the private practice of law even though they may have been appointed or designated either specially or generally as assistant attorneys general or attorneys. Notwithstanding that any attorney at law under independent contract to the Department of Law has been appointed or designated either specially or generally as an assistant attorney general and thus is identified with the State of Georgia as its representative for cases arising within the scope of that appointment or designation, representation of a defendant in criminal proceedings by that assistant attorney general shall not constitute a conflict of interest if that assistant attorney general provides written disclosure of such appointment or designation to the defendant prior to accepting employment by that defendant or, when a court has appointed an assistant attorney general to represent an indigent criminal defendant, disclosures to the defendant and to the court, to be reflected in the record of that court, such appointment or designation as assistant attorney general.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County attorney could act as agent for department.</b> - Even if the county attorney was not as an attorney at law authorized to act for the State Highway Department (now Department of Transportation), the county attorney was at least one who in fact purported to act as agent for the department in filing the appeal. While it is true that written authority to so act was not filed with the appeal, the county attorney's act was ratified by the Attorney General and this dispensed with the necessity of the presence of the written authority. State Hwy. Dep't v. Sumner, 102 Ga. App. 1, 115 S.E.2d 787 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>County attorney may act with actual and implied authority.</b> - When the condemnation proceeding could have been instituted in the name of the county itself and, in fact, the proceeding was brought by the county in the name of the State Highway Department (now Department of Transportation), and the county attorney's assistance in the case in other respects was never objected to or questioned, the county attorney had authority, actual as well as implied, to sign the appeal as attorney for the department.

<p class="p4"><b>Representation before Health Planning Review Board.</b> - The Assistant Attorney General fulfilled a constitutionally and statutorily mandated dual role in representing both the State Health Planning and Development Agency and the Health Planning Review Board, but this dual role as prosecutor and legal advisor to the Review Board did not taint the opportunity of each party to present its case in full before the Review Board.

L. 1975, p. 1184, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 does not indicate a willingness on the part of the General Assembly to authorize a state agency to be represented by private counsel of its choice who offer to do so at no expense to the agency. 1976 Op.

If a registered professional nurse, nurse practitioner, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant authorized to make a pronouncement of death under Code Section 31-10-16 or a qualified physician is not available, a coroner, deputy coroner, or medical examiner's investigator may make a pronouncement of death at the investigation scene if, and only if, one or more of the following conditions is met: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(D) Death has been established by qualified emergency medical services personnel. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) It shall be the duty of a coroner notified as required by Code Section 45-16-24 to summon a medical examiner and proper peace officer. It shall be the duty of a county medical examiner so notified to summon a proper peace officer. When present at the scene of death, the peace officer shall have jurisdiction over the scene of death. The medical examiner or coroner and the peace officer shall together make inquiries regarding the cause, manner, and circumstances of death. If either the peace officer or medical examiner is not present at the scene of death, then whichever of the two officers is present shall have jurisdiction over the scene of death. If neither the peace officer nor the medical examiner is present at the scene of death in any county in which the office of coroner has not been replaced by a county medical examiner, the coroner shall assume the responsibility of such officers at the scene of death and shall have the body transported to a local medical examiner who shall conduct a medical examiner's inquiry. The medical examiner, at any time, to facilitate examination, when he or she deems it necessary, may have the body embalmed or retain it for refrigeration for preservation or to avoid the threat of infectious disease prior to release of the body to the next of kin. Such expense of embalming shall be paid by the county of the coroner's or medical examiner's jurisdiction. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

This may be accomplished either by examination in situ or by removal of the jaws with teeth to the dentist's office. The dentist shall chart the deceased's dentition and make two copies, one of which shall be filed with the medical examiner's inquiry report to the division and the other with the Georgia Crime Information Center of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The dentist may, at his or her discretion, make such X-rays of the mouth as he or she deems necessary. The dentist shall be paid a fee as determined in accordance with Code Section 35-3-151.

The coroner, medical examiner, or peace officer shall take possession of any objects, anatomical specimens, or articles which, in his or her opinion, may be helpful in establishing the cause of death, manner of death, or identification of the deceased; and in cooperation with a forensic laboratory he or she may make such tests and examinations of said objects, specimens, or articles as may be necessary or useful in determining the cause of death, manner of death, or the identity of the deceased. At his or her discretion, the medical examiner or coroner may dispose of such objects, specimens, or articles when the medical examiner's or coroner's need for their retention has ended, provided that any property of value shall be returned to the next of kin of the deceased when no longer needed in the investigation or for evidence in a prosecution. Any coroner who converts property of a deceased to his or her personal use shall be guilty of a violation of Code Section 16-8-4 and upon conviction shall be punished as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of Code Section 16-8-12. In the event that a criminal prosecution arises, all such objects and articles together with reports of any examinations made upon them shall be retained in the custody of the investigating agency or the forensic laboratory which conducted the examination until their production as evidence is required by the prosecuting officer or upon written order of the peace officer in charge or court having proper jurisdiction. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Holds over until successor appointed.</b> - Notaries public are public officers, whose duties, oaths and powers are prescribed by law. They are appointed for four years, but upon the expiration of that time, a notary and the notary's office do not cease, but the notary continues to hold that position until a successor is appointed, or until the notary is removed.

<p class="p4"><b>Notarial acts after end of term.</b> - If, after the expiration of the term for which a notary was appointed and before that fact was discovered, the notary attested an affidavit, both parties acting in good faith, if not an officer de jure, the notary would, in such transaction, be an officer de facto, and the attestation would not be void.

<p class="p4"><b>Notary stamp on power of attorney sufficient to modify trust.</b> - Because a trust provided that the settlor "may at any time by duly executed written instrument alter or amend" the trust, the settlor had reserved the right to alter or amend the trust, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-40(a), and the settlor's execution of a power of attorney clearly expressed the settlor's intent to name the settlor's son as the executor of the settlor's estate and the trust and was properly notarized under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-17-6(a)(1).

<p class="p4"><b>Other exceptions.</b> - Unsworn declaration satisfied the requirements of 28 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1746 because it was in writing and subscribed by the declarant as true under penalty of perjury; therefore, it was allowed to be used as evidence in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, despite the general rule set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-17-6, requiring affidavits to contain a proper notarial seal.

<p class="p4"><b>Use of title.</b> - A notary public does not use a notary seal in the attestation of specified papers not requiring such use; a notary's title should be written under the notary's name, but when the seal is used it probably is not necessary for the notary to show such title. 1952-53 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Election by notary of words used in seal.</b> - The language of this section is clear and unambiguous; it is expressed in the disjunctive, and makes no distinction as to which notaries may use the words "State at Large," and which may use the words designating their county; the plain words of the statute give the election to any notary. In so doing, it is quite possible that the General Assembly intended that a notary whose activities, because of the notary's particular situation, would be confined to one county, would desire to identify with that particular county, whereas a notary whose situation would require travel over the state would desire to use the words "State at Large." 1957 Op.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority to attest affidavits.</b> - At one time there appears to have been doubt as to the power of notaries to attest affidavits in this state. It was removed by the Act of 1863, codified in this section. That statute, however, was properly in part declaratory of a power already recognized. Simpson v. Wicker, 120 Ga. 418, 47 S.E. 965, 1 Ann. Cas. 542 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">An affidavit is sufficient as a basis for framing an accusation in a criminal court, although made before a commercial notary public; the question remains, however, whether such an affidavit would furnish a sufficient foundation for the issuance of an arrest warrant. Mitchell v. State, 126 Ga. 84, 54 S.E. 931 (1906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notaries public do not have authority</b> to administer the oath required for an affidavit on which a dispossessory warrant is issued. Young v. Cowles, 128 Ga. App. 770, 197 S.E.2d 864 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action not requiring a seal.</b> - In attesting an affidavit in forma pauperis, accompanying a bill of exceptions, a notary public need not fix a seal, since it is not such a material act, under this section, as requires a seal for its authentication. Collins v. State, 206 Ga. 95, 55 S.E.2d 599 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notary also signing will as witness.</b> - It was error to grant summary judgment to a caveator in a will contest in which the first of three witnesses signed both as a witness and as a notary. Even if the first witness did not intend to act as a witness, if the first witness and a second witness signed the will in the decedent's presence, then O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20(b), requiring two witnesses, was satisfied even if a third witness signed outside the decedent's presence; furthermore, although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-17-8(c)(1) disqualified a witness from also acting as a notary, the first witness's disqualification as a notary was immaterial because the will was not a self-proving one requiring a notary.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conflict of interest disqualifies notaries.</b> - Having established themselves as active officers and spokespersons for a recall effort, notaries public became more than generally interested electors. Hence, any recall petition pages with affidavits notarized by the notaries or either of them were properly disregarded. Howell v. Tidwell, 258 Ga. 246, 368 S.E.2d 311 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A notary who circulated part of a nominating petition and also signed the petition was disqualified from notarizing circulators' affidavits on the petition, and it was proper to disqualify those pages with affidavits notarized by such person.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disqualification of notary.</b> - An affidavit, probating a mortgage, taken before the attorney of the mortgagee, who is a notary public, is not a legal affidavit, and a mortgage recorded on such probate is not legally recorded.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No private civil cause of action.</b> - Bank did not have a viable civil cause of action under the notary statute against an attorney who allegedly falsely attested that guarantee agreements were signed in the attorney's presence as, even when combined with the general statutory principles of tort law, notaries had a duty to the public that did not support an actionable claim.

<p class="p4"><b>Maximum not mandatory charge.</b> - The State Personnel Board and the Governor, in their discretion, can assess any state department any amount for its employer contribution not to exceed 4 (now 5) percent of that department's "total outlay for personal services." That provision simply sets a maximum limit on the employer's contribution which may be charged.

<p class="p4"><b>Amount of employer contribution.</b> - The statutory authority of the State Personnel Board and the Governor to set the employer contribution is no longer constrained by a percentage cap in general law. However, the authority is constrained by the health plan statute itself to require the board to set the contribution for the year within amounts made available by the appropriations act. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-3. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the board sets the employer contribution, it must take into account the budget, which in June has been finalized by enactment of the new appropriations act.

<p class="p4"><b>Right to express complaints and opinions.</b> - A state employee has the right, either singularly or collectively, to express or communicate complaints or opinions relating to state employment, including freedom to enter into organizations created for like purposes; the only limitation upon such activities of the state employees would prevent their striking, or otherwise interfering with proper performance of the duties of state employment, or obstructing access to or egress from state property. 1969 Op.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation v. Heard, 166 Ga. App. 895, 305 S.E.2d 670 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proving or disproving discrimination in "disparate impact" case.</b> - In a "disparate impact" case, all that the aggrieved employee need prove to establish a prima-facie case of discrimination is that, regardless of intent to discriminate, the employer's otherwise facially neutral selection device screens out a disproportionate number of minorities. Once this is shown, the burden then shifts to the employer to demonstrate that, although it has discriminatory consequences, its facially neutral selection device is in fact job-related. Georgia Bureau of Investigation v. Heard, 166 Ga. App. 895, 305 S.E.2d 670 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proving or disproving discrimination in "disparate treatment" cases.</b> - When dealing with subjective rather than facially-neutral and hence objective employment procedures, the case is to be treated as one involving "disparate treatment" wherein the employee's prima-facie case is shown by evidence that the subjective decision to deny the employee a promotion was racially motivated. The employer's rebuttal evidence must relate to defending the employee's subjective decision as having been based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. Georgia Bureau of Investigation v. Heard, 166 Ga. App. 895, 305 S.E.2d 670 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof in sex discrimination case.</b> - To establish a prima facie case of "disparate treatment" when discrimination on the basis of sex is alleged the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Kilmark v. Board of Regents, 175 Ga. App. 857, 334 S.E.2d 890 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Race discrimination.</b> - When an employer treats some employees less favorably than others due to race, the focus is on "disparate treatment." Georgia Dep't of Human Resources v. Montgomery, 248 Ga. 465, 284 S.E.2d 263 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requisites of prima-facie case of "disparate treatment."</b> - Plaintiff can make out a prima-facie claim of "disparate treatment" by showing: (i) that the plaintiff belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that the plaintiff applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite the plaintiff's qualifications, the plaintiff was rejected; and (iv) that, after the plaintiff's rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons with the complainant's qualifications.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Subjective evaluation against objective standards not "facially-neutral."</b> - When the employer's relevant promotion device consisted of a panel of supervisors who subjectively evaluated and rated each applicant's qualifications against a number of objective standards, such subjective decision-making promotional system was not such a "facially-neutral" employment practice that the proof thereof - standing alone and without further evidence authorizing a finding of discriminatory intent - will establish a prima-facie case of employment discrimination under the "discriminatory impact" theory and thereby shift the burden of proof to the employer.

L. 1978, p. 859 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 45-19-29 and 45-20-4), the State Personnel Board and the Office of Fair Employment Practices (OFEP) have overlapping jurisdiction over charges of unlawful employment discrimination in the classified service; however, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-19-41, if an individual processes a claim of discrimination with either the State Personnel Board or with the OFEP and receives a final determination from either the State Personnel Board or a special master, that person cannot then attempt to process a charge with the other agency where the second charge involves any issues that were determined by the first administrative agency or that could have been included under the rules of law in the original administrative action. Where there is concurrent jurisdiction, the charging party has a choice concerning the agency to which that party will apply for relief. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the purpose of this article to establish in the state a system of personnel administration which will attract, select, and retain the best employees based on merit, free from coercive political influences, with incentives in the form of equal opportunities for all; which will provide technically competent and loyal personnel to render impartial service to the public at all times and to render such service according to the dictates of ethics and morality; and which will remove unnecessary and inefficient employees. It is specifically the intent of the General Assembly to promote this purpose by allowing agencies greater flexibility in personnel management so as to promote the overall effectiveness and efficiency of state government. To this end, and in accordance with Code Sections 45-20-2 and 45-20-6, all positions filled after July 1, 1996, shall be included in the unclassified service as defined in this article, except as provided in Code Section 15-11-69. It is also specifically the intent of the General Assembly that employees in the classified service prior to July 1, 1996, shall continue to be employees in the classified service so long as they remain in classified positions or as otherwise provided by law. It is further specifically the intent of the General Assembly that state government operate within a framework of consistent core personnel policies and practices across all state agencies and entities and that the state's most valued resource, its employees, be managed in a manner to promote work force productivity and sound business practices. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to achieve these purposes, it is the policy of the state that agencies treat all employees in accordance with the following principles: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Assuring fair treatment of applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, religious creed, or political affiliations. This "fair treatment" principle includes compliance with all state and federal equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Recruiting, selecting, and advancing employees on the basis of their relative ability, knowledge, and skills, including open consideration of qualified applicants for initial employment; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Providing equitable and adequate compensation based on merit, performance, job value, and competitiveness within applicable labor markets; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Training employees, as needed, to assure high quality performance and to provide work force skills needed to maintain and advance the state's goals and objectives; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) Retaining employees on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, correcting inadequate performance where possible and appropriate, and separating employees whose performance is inadequate; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Assuring that employees are protected against coercion for partisan political purposes and are prohibited from using their official authority for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or nomination for office. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It shall be the responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services (DOAS) to perform the following functions: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Establish and maintain a state-wide system of pay ranges for all job classes; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Define job classes, establish associated minimum qualifications for those classes, and assign those classes to appropriate pay ranges; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Develop and maintain a common employment application form to be used by all applicants for state employment, which form may be supplemented as necessary by agencies in seeking information about agency job classes; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Develop, validate, or administer applicant screening devices when requested by agencies and when funding for such activities can be accomplished on a cost recovery basis; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) In consultation with agencies, establish state-wide criteria for the implementation of rules and policies adopted by the State Personnel Board which agencies shall use in developing internal processes for classification, compensation, pay for performance, and performance management, including processes involved in defining job classes, establishing and applying associated minimum qualifications, assigning jobs to appropriate state-wide pay ranges, developing and applying applicant screening methods, and measuring worker effectiveness; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Audit agencies' processes as referred to in paragraph (5) of this subsection and report findings annually to the Governor and the General Assembly in conjunction with an annual report on the overall status of the state work force.

Guidelines defining consideration practices shall be developed at the state level.

<p class="p8"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ranking of employees.</b> - The fact that Department of Natural Resources (DNR) pilots were ranked higher than pilots employed by the Georgia State Patrol did not violate rights of the latter since DNR employees are excluded from the merit system and the rank of state patrol employees must be compared with others in that system who are similarly situated for equal protection purposes.

<p class="p4"><b>1996 and 2000 amendments were not unconstitutional.</b> - Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IV, Sec. III, Para. I left it to the General Assembly to create a state merit system by the enactment of laws regarding selection of state personnel based on merit; legislation providing systems for public employment was subject to amendment or even repeal, and so the 1996 and 2000 amendments to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-2(15) were not unconstitutional.

<p class="p4"><b>Persons not covered.</b> - Plaintiff, a former safety engineering manager for Georgia Southern University, did not have a protected property interest in the plaintiff's continued employment at the time of termination and, thus, the plaintiff's termination did not support a due process claim against the individual defendants as, at the time of the plaintiff's termination, the applicable statute, former paragraph (15)(I) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-2, expressly excluded from the state merit system all officers, officials, and employees of the University System of Georgia, except those officers, officials, and employees already eligible to be covered by the state merit system by law or executive order.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Classified employees who have successfully completed a working test period may be dismissed from employment or otherwise adversely affected as to compensation or employment status only if such action is taken in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board governing adverse actions and appeals for classified employees. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This article is not intended to create a property interest in the job, but rather to create only a procedure under which classified employees can be dismissed or otherwise adversely affected. The procedure adopted for dismissing a classified employee from employment or otherwise adversely affecting his or her compensation or employment status shall include, as a minimum, that the appointing authority must provide the classified employee with reasons for the action and an opportunity to file an appeal and request a hearing which may be held before either the board or an administrative law judge of the Office of State Administrative Hearings; provided, however, that the hearing may be held subsequent to the effective date of the dismissal or other purported adverse action; provided, further, that the right to appeal shall not apply when persons are dismissed or otherwise adversely affected as to compensation due to curtailment of funds or reduction in staff when such action is in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No adverse action appealed to the State Personnel Board under the rules and regulations of the board, this article, or otherwise shall be considered invalid for failure to follow or comply with the rules and regulations of the board, this article, or any other requirement unless it is shown that the individual against whom the action has been taken has been substantially harmed by the procedural failure. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decision of the board on an appeal as to whether a dismissal or other adverse action was in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the State Personnel Board shall be binding upon the appointing authority. The board may modify the action of the appointing authority but may not increase the severity of such action on the employee. Such appointing authority shall promptly comply with such order as may be issued as a result of the appeal to the State Personnel Board. The decision of the board shall not limit the rights of the employee or the department to judicial review as to errors of law, and such decision shall be stayed pending other further appeal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Property interest entitling<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>employee to due process.</b> - A public employee governed by the Georgia Merit Systems Act and the State Board Personnel Rules has a property interest in the employee's job entitling the employee to the protections of due process. Brown v. Georgia Dep't of Revenue, 881 F.2d 1018 (11th Cir. 1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employees in the classified service may be terminated only after an evidentiary hearing</b> on the grounds of their discharge, employees in the unclassified service have no such rights. Ray v. Edwards, 557 F. Supp. 664 (N.D. Ga. 1982), modified on other grounds, 725 F.2d 655 (11th Cir. 1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employee's statutory right to a hearing.</b> - Trial court did not err when the court held that the State Personnel Board exceeded the board's authority in adopting regulations authorizing an administrative law judge to resolve an appeal from the board's termination of a classified state employee without holding an evidentiary hearing because the regulation at issue, Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x), did not comport with the Georgia Merit System Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 45-20-8 and 45-20-9, in that the regulation denied the employee, who had been deemed "voluntarily separated" from employment, the statutory right to a hearing. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Dillard, 313 Ga. App. 782, 723 S.E.2d 23 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Those portions of Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x) which dispense with the need for an evidentiary hearing in cases involving the voluntary separation of a classified employee are contrary to law; the curtailed procedure laid out in Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x) cannot be reconciled with either the statutory scheme, which contemplates that the State Personnel Board must provide the classified employee with reasons for the action and an opportunity to file an appeal and request a hearing, the Georgia Merit System Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-8(b), or the rule's own more general procedures, which require that, within seven days of the filing of an appeal, the administrative law judge or the board shall designate an appropriate time and place to conduct the hearing. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Dillard, 313 Ga. App. 782, 723 S.E.2d 23 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction over application to waive mandatory retirement.</b> - A conservation ranger's right to apply for a waiver of mandatory retirement pursuant to former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-224 imposed a duty on the board to consider the application and the board's refusal to consider it adversely affected the employee's "employment status" within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-8; accordingly, the board had jurisdiction over the subject matter. State Personnel Bd. v. Adams, 216 Ga. App. 341, 453 S.E.2d 821 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Demotion must be pursuant to Act as existed at hiring.</b> - The Merit System Act creates a constitutionally protected contract between the merit system member and the state; therefore, merit system employees can be demoted only in compliance with the Act as it existed at the time they assumed their classified positions. Clark &amp; Stephenson v. State Personnel Bd., 252 Ga. 548, 314 S.E.2d 658 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Board authorized to modify action of appointing authority.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-8(d) endows the board with authority to reduce a sanction imposed by the appointing authority even though the board finds sufficient evidence to support a charge for which the sanction of dismissal is authorized. Dollar v. Department of Human Resources, 196 Ga. App. 698, 396 S.E.2d 913 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Board authorized to reinstate dismissal by appointing authority.</b> - When the State Personnel Board, in reviewing the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) decreasing the sanction imposed on a state employee from dismissal to a 30-day suspension, reimposed the dismissal, it was error for a trial court to find that the board's decision was not supported by a sufficient rationale; the board properly adopted findings and conclusions of the ALJ which were consistent with the board's own decision and then explained that the ALJ's recommended sanction was too lenient for the proved misconduct, as the misconduct was so severe as to warrant dismissal, so the board's decision was within the board's broad authority to impose sanctions on state employees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-8(d).

The party appealing and the department from whose action the appeal is taken shall be notified in writing within 15 days from the filing of the appeal that an appeal has been filed and the time for which a hearing is scheduled. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Failure to comply with such order shall be cause for punishment as for contempt of court. The costs of securing the attendance of witnesses, including fees and mileage, shall be computed and assessed in the same manner as prescribed by law in civil cases in the superior court. Once issued a subpoena may be quashed by the board or an administrative law judge if it appears that the subpoena was used primarily as a means of harassment, that the testimony or documents sought are cumulative, that the testimony or documents sought are not relevant, that the testimony or documents sought are not material, that to respond to the subpoena would be unduly burdensome, or that for other good reasons basic fairness dictates that the subpoena should not be enforced. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Both parties shall have the right to present oral arguments to the board. Any presentation to the board on the matter by an administrative law judge shall be made in the presence of the parties.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of an evidentiary hearing</b> on a state trooper's claims that the trooper was harmed due to personal favoritism, cronyism and arbitrary decision-making within the Department of Public Safety was an abdication of the State Personnel Board's discretion and was contrary to law, arbitrary, and capricious. State Personnel Bd. v. Morton, 198 Ga. App. 845, 403 S.E.2d 455 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err when the court held that the State Personnel Board exceeded its authority in adopting regulations authorizing an administrative law judge to resolve an appeal from the board's termination of a classified state employee without holding an evidentiary hearing because the regulation at issue, Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x), did not comport with the Georgia Merit System Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 45-20-8 and 45-20-9, in that it denied the employee, who had been deemed "voluntarily separated" from employment, the statutory right to a hearing. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Dillard, 313 Ga. App. 782, 723 S.E.2d 23 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Those portions of Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x) which dispense with the need for an evidentiary hearing in cases involving the voluntary separation of a classified employee are contrary to law; the curtailed procedure laid out in Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x) cannot be reconciled with either the statutory scheme, which contemplates that the State Personnel Board must provide the classified employee with reasons for the action and an opportunity to file an appeal and request a hearing, the Georgia Merit System Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-8(b), or the Rule's own more general procedures, which require that, within seven days of the filing of an appeal, the administrative law judge or the board shall designate an appropriate time and place to conduct the hearing. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Dillard, 313 Ga. App. 782, 723 S.E.2d 23 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Exclusive jurisdiction of board to hear appeals.</b> - Only the board, and not the merit system commissioner, has the authority to review the decisions of a hearing officer. Brown v. Ledbetter, 569 F. Supp. 170 (N.D. Ga. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction over reprisals by employees.</b> - State Personnel Board should be given first opportunity to pass on issue of reprisals against employees by fellow employees, that issue being within the primary jurisdiction of the board. Bailey v. Wilkes, 162 Ga. App. 410, 291 S.E.2d 418 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judicial review of demotion of state employee.</b> - When the plaintiff, who was demoted by the employer, Georgia Retardation Center, a division of the Department of Human Resources (DHR), pursued administrative remedies, culminating in the denial of the plaintiff's appeal by the State Personnel Board, and then petitioned the superior court for judicial review, it was held that the plaintiff's employer is governed by the Georgia Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but the decision of which plaintiff seeks review is one made not by DHR but by the State Personnel Board, which is not governed by the APA, but by the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-1 et seq. Duval v. Department of Human Resources, 183 Ga. App. 726, 359 S.E.2d 756 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judicial affirmation of administrative ruling res judicata in subsequent federal civil rights action.</b> - A prior state court affirmance of a state administrative ruling is entitled to res judicata and collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent federal civil rights action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1983, notwithstanding the fact that the state court's review was limited to a determination of whether there was "any evidence" in the record sufficient to support the factual findings of the administrative tribunal. Gorin v. Osborne, 756 F.2d 834 (11th Cir. 1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Board order denying jurisdiction deemed final decision.</b> - The superior court had jurisdiction to hear and decide an appeal by a state employee from a determination of the board that it lacked jurisdiction over the person of the employee; the board's determination was final in that it denied the employee an ability to obtain a hearing before the board and, thus, the court was authorized to render a final decision in the case and issue an order thereon. State Personnel Bd. v. Adams, 216 Ga. App. 341, 453 S.E.2d 821 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order of the State Personnel Board denying state's motion to dismiss appeal was not a final decision</b> in the case but was analogous to denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint and thus was not appealable to superior court. Majanovic v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 163 Ga. App. 450, 294 S.E.2d 669 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Venue.</b> - Subject-matter jurisdiction for judicial review of State Personnel Board decisions lies in the superior courts with venue in the county of the place of employment of the employee. Duval v. Department of Human Resources, 183 Ga. App. 726, 359 S.E.2d 756 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Notwithstanding plaintiff having filed an action in the wrong county for venue purposes, the superior court errs in dismissing the action. Rather, in light of the defendant's motion to dismiss, the court should have transferred the case to the appropriate forum. Duval v. Department of Human Resources, 183 Ga. App. 726, 359 S.E.2d 756 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Clearly erroneous" standard of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 45-20-9(m) is the same as the "any evidence rule."</b> Hall v. Ault, 240 Ga. 585, 242 S.E.2d 101 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">State Personnel Board's decision must be affirmed by superior court when supported by "any evidence." Department of Human Resources v. Green, 160 Ga. App. 37, 285 S.E.2d 772 (1981); Department of Human Resources v. Turner, 174 Ga. App. 483, 330 S.E.2d 418 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On appeal from a denial of an application for indemnification for the death of a prison guard by the Georgia State Indemnification Commission, even if the findings of fact urged upon the reviewing court by the appellant were supported by the evidence presented at trial, if the facts found by the special master were supported by some credible evidence, the reviewing court could not disturb those findings. Georgia State Indemnification Comm'n v. Lyons, 256 Ga. 311, 348 S.E.2d 642 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-9(m) has consistently been construed as confining the scope of review by the superior court to the "any evidence" standard. Department of Human Resources v. Horne, 198 Ga. App. 341, 401 S.E.2d 556, cert. denied, 198 Ga. App. 897, 401 S.E.2d 556 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The trial court erred in reversing the dismissals of two correctional officers for use of excessive force against an inmate since the terminations were supported by some evidence, and there was no abuse of discretion in the board's failure to impose less severe punishment. Department of Cors. v. Shaw, 217 Ga. App. 33, 456 S.E.2d 628 (1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the State Personnel Board, in reviewing the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) decreasing the sanction imposed on a state employee from dismissal to a 30-day suspension, reimposed the dismissal, it was error for a trial court to find that the board's decision was not supported by a sufficient rationale; the board had properly adopted findings and conclusions of the ALJ which were consistent with the board's own decision and then explained that the ALJ's recommended sanction was too lenient for the proved misconduct as the misconduct was so severe as to warrant dismissal so the board's decision was not arbitrary and capricious under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-9(m)(5). Ga. Dep't of Natural Res. v. Willis, 274 Ga. App. 801, 619 S.E.2d 335 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Any evidence" standard does not raise constitutional question.</b> - The fact that the Georgia legislature and courts have confined the scope of review in appeals from the State Personnel Board to an "any evidence" standard does not present a constitutional due process violation and, hence, the plaintiff was precluded as a matter of law from litigating a federal constitutional claim because of plaintiff's previous state suit involving the same cause of action. Howkins v. Caldwell, 587 F. Supp. 98 (N.D. Ga. 1983), aff'd, 749 F.2d 731 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1117, 105 S. Ct. 2361, 86 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employee must first present to the personnel board</b> claims that the department has failed to abide by a court's ruling reversing the board's upholding of an employee's dismissal, including issues of back pay and other benefits. There is no provision for de novo consideration of any issue by the superior court. Department of Corrections v. Colbert, 202 Ga. App. 27, 413 S.E.2d 498 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 45-20-9(m) prevents a de novo determination</b> of evidentiary questions leaving only a determination of whether the facts found by the board are supported by any evidence. Hall v. Ault, 240 Ga. 585, 242 S.E.2d 101 (1978); Stanley v. Department of Human Resources, 146 Ga. App. 450, 246 S.E.2d 459 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When reviewing a decision of the State Personnel Board, if there is any evidence to support the decision of the board, the decision should be affirmed. Harris v. Department of Human Resources, 149 Ga. App. 500, 254 S.E.2d 866 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court must confine its review "to the record";</b> this clearly means the entire record. Department of Natural Resources v. Wilmot, 151 Ga. App. 324, 259 S.E.2d 715 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lack of authority to compel promotion.</b> - Neither the State Board, the superior court, nor the appellate court has the authority to compel a promotion when the appointing authority has, within the bounds of its permissible discretions, declined to do so. Horne v. Skelton, 152 Ga. App. 654, 263 S.E.2d 528 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reversal for departure from board policy.</b> - Trial court had the authority to reverse or remand decision of State Personnel Board on ground that the board abused its discretion by departing from its progressive discipline policy. Georgia Dep't of Labor v. Sims, 164 Ga. App. 856, 298 S.E.2d 562 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rights of third parties.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-9 did not authorize the superior court to reverse the state personnel board's decision regarding termination of a corrections officer based on the right of a third-party inmate to defend themselves in a disciplinary action. Department of Cors. v. Derry, 235 Ga. App. 622, 510 S.E.2d 832 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Review of school instructor's dismissal.</b> - State Personnel Board was authorized to reverse an administrative law judge's (ALJ) determination upholding a school instructor's dismissal, as O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-20-9(e)(2) comprehensively and specifically regulated the board's authority in its review of an ALJ's initial decision following a dismissal or adverse personnel action hearing.

Within 21 days after such notice is sent by first-class mail, each such department chief executive officer shall provide a written response to the commission regarding whether or not such department has available any position of continued employment for that official or employee proposed for termination from employment which may meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of Code Section 45-24-8.

If the commission determines such response meets those requirements, it shall offer continued employment in that position to the officer or employee on whose behalf the response was obtained; otherwise, the commission shall proceed as provided in subsection (c) of this Code section. Any official or employee who is thus offered a position of continued employment shall be deemed to have resigned from service at his or her own choice upon that person's failure to accept the position of continued employment, and no such official or employee so resigning from service shall qualify for retirement benefits based upon involuntary separation from employment without prejudice. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Five members of the commission shall be a quorum. At the meeting, the employer shall have the burden of convincing the commission that the involuntary separation is necessary, justified, and in the best interests of the state. The commission may request as much information and may meet as many times on each case as it deems necessary to reach an informed decision. No action shall be taken on the separation of the officer or employee until the commission makes a final determination as to whether the separation is necessary, justified, and in the best interests of the state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
