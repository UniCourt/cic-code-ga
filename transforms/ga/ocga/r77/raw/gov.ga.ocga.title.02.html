<p class="p8">Whenever the Constitution or laws of the United States or the State of Georgia require the issuance of a warrant to make an inspection under any law administered by the Commissioner of Agriculture or the Department of Agriculture, the procedure set forth in paragraphs (1) through (7) of this Code section shall be employed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">(1) The Commissioner or any person authorized to make inspections for the Commissioner shall make application for an inspection warrant to a person who is a judicial officer within the meaning of Code Section 17-5-21. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) An inspection warrant shall be issued only upon cause and when supported by an affidavit particularly describing the place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected and the purpose for which the inspection is to be made. In addition, the affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Cause shall be deemed to exist if either reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle, or there is reason to believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified therein, but not for a period of more than 14 days, unless extended or renewed by the judicial officer who signed and issued the original warrant, upon satisfying himself that such extension or renewal is in the public interest. Such inspection warrant must be executed and returned to the judicial officer by whom it was issued within the time specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the expiration of such time, the warrant, unless executed, is void. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) An inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant shall be made between 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. of any day or at any time during operating or regular business hours. An inspection should not be performed in the absence of an owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle unless specifically authorized by the judicial officer upon a showing that such authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the regulation being enforced. An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible entry where facts are shown which are sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a violation of this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department, which, if such violation existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful. Where prior consent has been sought and refused and a warrant has been issued, the warrant may be executed without further notice to the owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(5) It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to allow an inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant issued as provided in this Code section. Any person violating this paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(6) Under this Code section, an inspection warrant is an order, in writing, signed by a judicial officer, directed to the Commissioner or any person authorized to make inspections for the Commissioner, and commanding him or her to conduct any inspection required or authorized by this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department or regulations promulgated pursuant to this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided in subsection (n) of this Code section for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall mature at such times and bear interest at such rates as may be determined by the authority, payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman or vice chairman of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary or assistant secretary of the authority; and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairman or vice chairman of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person, and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under this chapter shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted.

The resolution or indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. The resolution or indenture may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Such holder, receiver, or trustee may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this chapter, or by resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, rents, and other charges for the use of the project or projects. In the event of default of the authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any revenue bond issue, such holder, receiver, or trustee shall be subrogated to each and every right which the authority may possess and, in the pursuit of his or its remedies as subrogee, may proceed either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceedings due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged directly or indirectly to the benefit of the revenue bond issue of which such holder, receiver, or trustee is representative. No holder, receiver, or trustee shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon, or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is recognized and declared: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) That the soil resources and fertility of the land of this state and the economic use thereof, the prosperity of the farming population of this state, the navigability of the rivers and harbors of this state, and the prevention of floods in this state are matters affected with a public interest; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) That the welfare of this state has been impaired and is in danger of being further impaired by destruction of its soil fertility, by uneconomic use and waste of its land, by exploitation and wasteful and unscientific use of its soil resources, by floods and impairment of its rivers and harbors and of the navigability of its waters and water courses as a result of soil erosion, and by the decrease in the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms in the state as compared with the net income per person in the state not on farms; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) That such evils have been augmented and are likely to be augmented by similar conditions in other states and are so interrelated with such conditions in other states that the remedying of such conditions in this state requires action by this state in cooperation with the governments and agencies of other states and of the United States and requires assistance therein by the government and agencies of the United States; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) That the formulation and effectuation by this state of state plans in conformity with Section 7 of the federal Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act is calculated to remedy such conditions and will tend to advance the public welfare of this state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Therefore, in order to promote the welfare of the people of this state by aiding in the preservation and improvement of soil fertility, in the promotion of the economic use and conservation of land, in the diminution of exploitation and wasteful and unscientific use of soil resources, in the protection of rivers and harbors against the results of soil erosion, and in the reestablishment, at as rapid a rate as is practicable and in the general public interest, of the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms and that of the net income per person not on farms that prevailed during the five-year period beginning August, 1909, and ending July, 1914, as determined from statistics available in the United States Department of Agriculture, and the maintenance of such ratio, this state assents to and accepts the federal Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and adopts the policy and purpose of cooperating with the government and agencies of other states and of the United States in the accomplishment of the policy and purposes specified in Section 7 of such act, subject, however, to the following limitations: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) The powers conferred in this article shall be used to assist voluntary action calculated to effectuate such purposes; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) Such powers shall not be used to discourage the production of supplies of foods and fibers in this state which are sufficient, when taken together with the production thereof in other states of the United States, to maintain normal domestic human consumption, as determined by the secretary of agriculture of the United States from the records of consumption in the years 1920 to 1929, inclusive, taking into consideration increased population, quantities of any commodities that were forced into domestic consumption by a decline in exports of particular commodities, and the quantities of substitutes available for domestic consumption within any general class of food commodities; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) In carrying out the purposes specified in this Code section, due regard shall be given to the maintenance of a continuous and stable national supply of agricultural commodities, adequate to meet consumer demand at prices fair to both producers and consumers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8">(G) Failure by any landowner or occupier of land to conserve the soil and control erosion upon his lands causes a washing and blowing of soil and water from his lands onto other lands and makes the conservation of soil and control of erosion on such other lands difficult or impossible; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">The purpose of this article is to regulate, in the public interest, the labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, use, and disposal of pesticides. The General Assembly finds that pesticides are valuable to this state's agricultural production and to the protection of man and the environment from insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be pests but that it is essential to the public health and welfare that they be regulated to prevent adverse effects on human life and on the environment. New pesticides which are valuable to the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, and plant regulators are continually being discovered or synthesized. The dissemination of accurate scientific information as to the proper use of any pesticide is vital to the public health and welfare and to the environment, both immediately and in the future. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of such pesticides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">The purpose of this article is to regulate, in the public interest, the use and application of pesticides to control pests, as defined in this article. Pesticides perform a valuable role by:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">(1) Controlling insects, fungi, nematodes, rodents, and other pests which ravage and destroy our supply of food and fiber, which serve as vectors of disease, and which otherwise constitute a nuisance in the environment or the home; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) Controlling weeds which compete in the production of food and fiber and which otherwise are unwanted elements in our environment; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) Regulating plant growth to enhance both the quantity and quality of our supply of food and fiber and to facilitate its harvest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">New pesticides are continually being discovered, synthesized, or developed which are valuable for the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, and related purposes. However, such pesticides may be ineffective, may cause injury to man, or may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment if not properly used. Pesticides may injure man or animals, either by direct poisoning or by gradual accumulation of pesticide residues in the tissues. Crops or other plants may also be injured by the improper use of pesticides. The drifting or washing of pesticides into streams or lakes may cause appreciable damage to aquatic life. A pesticide applied for the purpose of killing pests in a crop which is not itself injured by the pesticide may drift and injure other crops or nontarget organisms with which it comes in contact. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of the use and application of such pesticides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">The Pest Control Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein. The compact is substantially as follows:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p5">PEST CONTROL COMPACT<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p14"><span class="s2">A</span>RTICLE I. FINDINGS.<span class="s2"> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p8">The party states find that:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this compact, the annual loss of approximately 25 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another, to complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crop and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an Insurance Fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interests, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs. <br>

<p class="p8">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">1. The maintenance of pest control and eradication activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of this compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">2. The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been done in the absence of this compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, or whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent, or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use monies made available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">1. A detailed statement of the circumstances which occasion the request for the invoking of the compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">2. Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">3. A statement of the extent of the present and projected program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefor, in connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of introduction of the pest concerned. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">4. Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">5. A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the invoking of the compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of monies from the Insurance Fund in one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">6. Such other information as the Governing Board may require consistent with the provisions of this compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall give due notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the Insurance Fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to the compact administrator of each party state and to such other officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party states. The requesting state and any other party state shall be entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such meeting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The Governing Board or the Executive Committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefor shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a determination of the Executive Committee shall upon notice in writing given within 20 days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the Governing Board. Determinations of the Executive Committee shall be reviewable only by the Governing Board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the Governing Board may authorize. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(g)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this compact may receive monies from the Insurance Fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the Insurance Fund. The Governing Board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(h)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before authorizing the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the Insurance Fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation which may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of the federal government for such assistance and participation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(i)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Insurance Fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent and degree of assistance or participation between and among the Insurance Fund, cooperating federal agencies, states and any other entities concerned. <br>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p8">The Governing Board may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its functions. Any such advisory or technical committee, or any member or members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations. Upon request of the Governing Board or Executive Committee an advisory or technical committee may furnish information and recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from the Insurance Fund being considered by such Board or Committee and the Board or Committee may receive and consider the same: provided that any participant in a meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of the compact shall be entitled to know the substance of any such information and recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto or as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at which the Governing Board or Executive Committee makes its disposition of the application. <br>

<p class="p8">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A party state may make application for assistance from the Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such application shall be considered and disposed of by the Governing Board or Executive Committee in the same manner as an application with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in this Article. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At or in connection with any meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of this compact a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate, and receive information only to such extent as the Governing Board or Executive Committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be entitled to review of any determination made by the Executive Committee. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state only after determining that the conditions in such state and the value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify them. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may set any conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to expenditures and activities outside of party states. <br>

<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The requests for appropriations shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth of the total budget in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products, produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops and products the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of products. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The financial assets of the Insurance Fund shall be maintained in two accounts to be designated respectively as the "Operating Account" and the "Claims Account."

<p class="p7"><b>2-7-156. Assessment for suppression and eradication programs; conditions.<br>
</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">An assessment shall be levied upon all cotton growers in this state to cover, in whole or in part, the cost of boll weevil suppression and eradication programs authorized by this article, subject to the following:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">(1) All assessments imposed on cotton shall be levied on a per acre or per bale basis as determined by the Commissioner upon recommendation of the cotton growers' organization; provided, however, that the per acre assessment shall continue to be used so long as acreage certification is available to the department; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) The per acre or per bale assessment, the period for which it shall be levied, and the geographical area to which the assessment applies shall be established by the Commissioner, upon recommendation by the board of directors of the cotton growers' organization; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) When the assessment is imposed on a per bale basis, it shall be the duty of each first handler of cotton from cotton growers in this state to collect the assessments imposed pursuant to this article on such cotton, to file reports on forms prescribed by the Commissioner listing such sales and the name of the grower, and to remit the amounts so imposed and collected to the Commissioner within 30 days of the date of purchase of the cotton; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) The Commissioner of Agriculture is authorized, and it shall be the Commissioner's duty, to receive, collect, hold in trust, and disburse all assessments and any other funds created under this article as trust funds of the cotton growers' organization, without complying with the requirements applicable to funds collected for the use and benefit of the state. Such funds shall not be required to be deposited in the state treasury and appropriated therefrom. All moneys collected by the Commissioner shall be deposited in a bank or other depository approved by the growers' organization and shall be disbursed by the Commissioner only upon the written authorization of the certified cotton growers' organization for the administration and implementation of the boll weevil eradication program. Should the eradication program be discontinued or certification of the growers' organization be revoked by the Commissioner, the assessments authorized by this article shall be discontinued on the date specified by the Commissioner and any funds remaining in its hands at such time are authorized to be paid out by the Commissioner for existing obligations and for winding up the affairs of the certified cotton growers' organization. Any funds remaining over and above those required for completing the business of the cotton growers' organization shall be paid by the Commissioner to the contributing growers on a pro rata basis; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(5) Records maintained by the Commissioner on behalf of the certified cotton growers' organization shall be audited at least annually by the state auditor; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(6) The Commissioner shall have a lien for the payment of assessments under this article which shall be of equal dignity with liens for taxes in favor of the state. The Commissioner is authorized to issue executions for the collection of such assessments in like manner as executions are issued for ad valorem property taxes due the state. It shall be the duty of each and every sheriff of this state and their lawful deputies, upon request of the Commissioner, to levy and collect such executions and to make their return thereof to the Commissioner in like manner as such tax executions are levied and return thereof made to county tax collectors and tax commissioners; provided, however, that the Commissioner shall be authorized to levy and collect his or her own executions; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(7) In addition to the lien provided in paragraph (6) of this Code section, the Commissioner shall have a special lien on cotton for payment of assessments which shall be superior to any other lien provided by law, shall arise as of the time the assessments become due and payable, and shall cover all cotton grown by or ginned from the cotton grower from the date the lien arises until such assessments are paid; provided, however, that any buyers of cotton shall take free of such lien if such buyer has not received written notice of the lien from the Commissioner. Such lien extends to the proceeds of sale received by the person who originally bought the cotton from the grower. Notice may be provided by tagging the cotton as being subject to a delinquency or by documentation in the sales agreement indicating that the cotton is subject to a delinquency. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative is authorized and empowered to so tag the cotton wherever found. In order to enforce such liens, the Commissioner is authorized to issue an execution for the collection of delinquent assessments due the Commissioner. The execution shall be directed to all and singular sheriffs of this state and shall command them to levy upon the cotton of the cotton grower or notified initial buyer; provided, however, that the Commissioner shall be authorized to levy and collect his or her own executions. Each sheriff or the Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative shall execute the execution as in cases of writs of execution from the superior courts. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative may levy and conduct judicial sales in the manner provided by law for sales by sheriffs and constables. The special lien on cotton may also be enforced by a foreclosure action or action at law, as appropriate, brought by the Commissioner in the superior court of the county of residence of the person who originally bought the cotton from the grower. A buyer of cotton other than a person buying cotton from the grower takes free of the lien created by this paragraph.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8">Before any license is issued the applicant shall make and deliver to the Commissioner a surety bond executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the Commissioner. Any and all bond applications shall be accompanied by a certificate of "good standing" issued by the Commissioner of Insurance. If any company issuing a bond shall be removed from doing business in this state, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Insurance to notify the Commissioner of Agriculture within 30 days. The bond shall be in such amount as the Commissioner may determine, not exceeding an amount equal to the maximum amount of products purchased from or sold for Georgia producers or estimated to be purchased or sold in any month by the applicant; provided, however, that the minimum amount of such bond shall be $10,000.00 and the maximum amount of such bond shall be $230,000.00; provided, further, that in the case of pecans, such bond shall not exceed $500,000.00. Such bond shall be upon a form prescribed or approved by the Commissioner and shall be conditioned to secure the faithful accounting for and payment to producers or their agents or representatives of the proceeds of all agricultural products handled or sold by such dealer. However, in lieu of a surety bond, the Commissioner may accept a cash bond, which shall in all respects be subject to the same claims and actions as would exist against a surety bond. Whenever the Commissioner shall determine that a previously approved bond has for any cause become insufficient, the Commissioner may require an additional bond or bonds to be given, conforming with the requirements of this Code section. Unless the additional bond or bonds are given within the time fixed by written demand therefor, or if the bond of a dealer is canceled, the license of such person shall be immediately revoked by operation of law without notice or hearing and such person shall be ineligible to reapply for such license for a period of four years after such revocation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
