<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose.</b> - Uniform Commercial Code was developed and enacted to establish standard business laws throughout the United States, and uniform interpretation and application of the code promotes general welfare by simplifying interstate business activity. Citizens Bank v. Ansley, 467 F. Supp. 51 (M.D. Ga.), aff'd, 604 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Uniform Commercial Code was designed to avoid artificial pitfalls and technicalities. Citizens Bank v. Ansley, 467 F. Supp. 51 (M.D. Ga.), aff'd, 604 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Title 11 and Ch. 3, T. 40, must be construed in pari materia.</b> - O.C.G.A. T. 11 and Ch. 3, T. 40, were adopted at the same session of the Georgia General Assembly and they relate in part to the same subject matter and must be construed in pari materia. GMAC v. Whisnant, 387 F.2d 774 (5th Cir. 1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Special property class legislation.</b> - Though the commercial code applies to all commercial transactions in personal property in this state, some transactions are governed by laws dealing with special classes of property. Anderson v. Kensington Mtg. &amp; Fin. Corp., 166 Ga. App. 604, 305 S.E.2d 128 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This title does not purport to change law relating to instruments transferring interests in land.</b> Newton v. Allen, 220 Ga. 681, 141 S.E.2d 417 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Writing purporting to lease trees for turpentine purposes,</b> not merely product thereof, was lease of realty, and did not constitute a contract for sale of personalty under O.C.G.A. T. 11. Newton v. Allen, 220 Ga. 681, 141 S.E.2d 417 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Liberal construction.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-102 specifies that the Uniform Commercial Code shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies, one of which, of course, is to broaden within the framework provided the protection of warranties beyond the original notion of privity of contract.

<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-105 permits parties to provide by agreement which state's law shall govern their transaction but only if transaction bears "reasonable relation" to state so designated.

<p class="p4"><b>Conflict of laws rule of forum state determines what state's substantive law applies.</b> - Where question of whether lessee was entitled to prevail on its failure of consideration defense in diversity action brought for breach of lease depended upon what state's substantive law applied, it was necessary to look to conflict of laws rule of forum state.

<p class="p4"><b>Georgia adheres to the traditional choice of law system.</b> - Under this system tort actions are adjudicated according to the law of the place where the wrong occurred, and contract actions are regulated by the law of the state where the contract was made when matters of execution, interpretation, or validity are at issue, and by the law of the state where it is to be performed when the issue is one concerning performance.

<p class="p4">In a products liability diversity action brought on the theory of breach of implied warranty of merchantability, Georgia procedural law, which looked to the lex loci delicti, controlled the claim. Since the injury took place in Georgia, Georgia substantive law, which required privity, was applied. The plaintiff, who was an employee of the purchaser of the product, failed to satisfy this privity requirement. Morgan v. Mar-Bel, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 438 (N.D. Ga. 1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Contract may bear "appropriate relation" to Georgia, though entered into in another state.</b> - The phrase "applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state" means, that notwithstanding a contract has been entered into in another state, if it is litigated in Georgia and bears an "appropriate relation" to Georgia, its validity will be governed by Georgia law.

<p class="p4"><b>Repossessions of collateral located in Georgia.</b> - Absent an agreement that the law of another state shall govern, Georgia law applies to the repossession, resale, and right to a deficiency judgment where the collateral was located in Georgia at the time of the repossession and resale. Lewis v. First Nat'l Bank, 134 Ga. App. 798, 216 S.E.2d 347 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Unilateral reservation of rights in endorsing draft.</b> - In a tort action in Georgia, where defendant's insurer, a Florida corporation, tendered to plaintiff a draft payable through a Florida bank and plaintiff crossed out the printed endorsement/release before endorsing the draft to a body shop and added a handwritten endorsement reserving defendant's rights, the lex fori, i.e., the law of Georgia, should be applied where both parties are Georgia residents, since the relationship of the insurer to the parties and the action is that of defendant's agent for the payment of a sum or sums due plaintiff under the terms of the contract of insurance between defendant and the insurer and the collecting bank is the agent of the insurer. The residence of the agent or subagent is irrelevant, absent special circumstances. Wallace v. Harrison, 166 Ga. App. 461, 304 S.E.2d 487 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement governs rights and liabilities of parties.</b> - It is elementary that under the law of contracts the agreement itself governs the rights and liabilities of the parties. Nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in Georgia requires a different result. Tri-County Livestock Auction Co. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement not a lease.</b> - Claimant's unwritten agreement with an individual concerning a vehicle was not a lease because the claimant offered no evidence that the individual had the right to voluntarily terminate the individual's payment obligation under the agreement, i.e., to pay less than the full amount of consideration under the lease, or that the individual could purchase the vehicle only after paying additional consideration.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Buyer's special relationship with seller does not preclude buyer from being buyer in the ordinary sense.</b> - Although the fact that a person had a special relationship with the seller would not preclude the person from being a buyer in the ordinary course, this factor, along with other factors that the sale was not handled in every material way as a sale out of inventory to any retail customer, may preclude such person from being a buyer in the ordinary course of business. Hanington v. Palmer, 103 Bankr. 348 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Knowledge of security interest.</b> - A buyer who merely knows of a security interest of another party covering certain goods constitutes a buyer in ordinary course of business and takes free of that security interest, whereas a buyer who knows that the sale actually violates some term of the security agreement not waived by the secured party takes subject to that security interest. First Nat'l Bank v. Atlanta Classic Cars, Inc., 184 Ga. App. 784, 363 S.E.2d 16 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although a bank's security interests in equipment were properly perfected and remained so throughout a buyer's acquisition of the equipment from the debtor, those security interests were deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser for value when the bank failed to file timely continuation statements, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-515(b), and the buyer took free of the security interests under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-317(b) because the buyer did not have actual knowledge of the security interests.

<p class="p4">Because plaintiff cellular telephone trademark holder's packages contained terms and conditions inside and language on the outside of the packages that referenced those terms and conditions, there was a valid "shrink-wrap" contract between the holder and purchasers of the cell phones, and allegations that defendant competitor removed the phones from their original packaging and shipped the phones outside the United States sufficiently raised a reasonable expectation that discovery would reveal evidence that the competitor was aware of the terms and conditions, was afforded an opportunity to reject the terms and conditions, and failed to reject the terms and conditions, such that a breach of contract claim was plausible, and, because the allegations indicated a lack of good faith by the competitor, the bona fide purchaser for value and buyer in the ordinary course defenses under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-1-201 and 11-2-403(1)(a) were not available.

<p class="p4">Roofing material vendor's disclaimer of warranty, which stated in capitalized letters that the vendor made no warranties, express or implied, including merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, except as expressly stated therein, was sufficient to preclude an action against the vendor for breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.

<p class="p4"><b>Disclaimer inadequate.</b> - Where a paragraph in a lease purporting to disclaim implied warranties of merchantibility and fitness was in the same size font as the rest of the printed terms and, although separately numbered, was not otherwise set apart from the other paragraphs, the language was not "conspicuous" within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-201(10).

<p class="p4">The best test for determining the intent of an agreement which provides for an option to buy - that is, whether it is a lease or a security agreement - is a comparison of the option price with the market value of the equipment at the time the option is to be exercised.

If the lessees can acquire the property under the purchase option for little or no additional consideration in relation to its true value, the lease is one intended for security. If the lessees are required to pay at least a reasonable price, if not a price equal to or greater than the actual value of the automobile, at option time in order to exercise their purchase option, the agreement is intended to be and is in fact a true lease and not a disguised security transaction.

Fulton Nat'l Bank v. Willis Denney Ford, Inc., 154 Ga. App. 846, 269 S.E.2d 916 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-1-203 does not state a cause of action</b> for which a claim of relief may be granted. Management Assistance, Inc. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No independent cause of action created by O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>11-1-203. - Inasmuch as a borrower could not prevail on its breach of contract claim against a lender, it could not prevail on a cause of action based on the failure to act in good faith in performing the contract because there was no independent cause of action for breach of duty of good faith in performing a contract governed by the Uniform Commercial Code.

<p class="p4"><b>Good faith required in foreclosing on security deed.</b> - Homeowner stated a claim for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing against the homeowner's mortgage lender based on the lender's legal duty in the security agreement to conduct the foreclosure of the property fairly, acting as the owner's agent.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inapplicable to franchise agreement.</b> - Because a franchise agreement primarily governed issues regarding the proper operation of a franchise restaurant, advertising, the use of trademarks, trade names, and service marks, and the provisions regarding goods were incidental at best, the court concluded that non-sale aspects predominated the franchise agreement, and the duty of good faith and fair dealing embodied in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-203 did not apply.

Furthermore, the trial court did not err in putting the question of predominant purpose to the jury because the evidence permitted a rational jury to resolve this issue in a way that would lead to a conclusion that the sale of goods under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-107(1) was the predominant purpose of the contemplated transaction.

<p class="p4"><b>Written contract enforceable if showing agreement, basis for relief, and signed by party charged.</b> - Written agreement signed by party against whom enforcement is sought constitutes valid, enforceable contract if it shows that a contract has been agreed to and there is a reasonably certain basis for granting relief.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Invoices on printed forms bearing sender's name and address.</b> - Invoices which are sent on printed forms bearing a party's name and address are "sufficient against the sender" and thus may be considered a written confirmation of an alleged contract within meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201.

<p class="p4"><b>One party signing written confirmation.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201 allows formation of enforceable contract even though only one party signs written confirmation.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure to answer written confirmation within 10 days of receipt.</b> - Between merchants, failure to answer written confirmation of contract within 10 days of receipt is tantamount to a writing under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201(2) and is sufficient against both parties under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201(1). The only effect, however, is to take away from the party who fails to answer the defense of the statute of frauds; burden of persuading trier of fact that a contract was in fact made orally prior to written confirmation is unaffected. Edwards v. Wilbur-Ellis Co., 379 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Ga. 1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Written confirmation between merchants enforceable only as to quantity specified.</b> - Between merchants, requirement of a writing is satisfied by a writing in confirmation of contract which is received within a reasonable time by party against whom enforcement is sought and which is sufficient to bind the sender, but is enforceable only with respect to quantity of goods shown in the writing.

<p class="p4"><b>Confirmation order of broker sufficient writing.</b> - As there was evidence from which it could be inferred that a peanut commodities broker's confirmation order was a writing that was signed by both parties to the transaction, through the broker as their agent, and that the confirmation was signed by the sender's agent such that it was sufficient against the sender, the seller could not rely on a defense under the Statute of Frauds to the buyer's claims.

<p class="p4">Where the sale of goods involves two parties who are merchants, the invoices for the sale constitute written confirmation of the agreement; in addition, buyer's acceptance of the delivered goods takes the agreement out of the statute of frauds due to partial performance.

<p class="p4"><b>Preprinted "limited warranty" language.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2(7), preprinted "limited warranty" language on the back of a confirmation had no effect because it directly contradicted the full warranty language that was typed on the front of the preprinted confirmation form; the court erred when it relied on this warranty to bar claims for lost profits or other special damages.

On the other hand, change orders that dealt with services that the contractor was asked to provide over and above the initial installation of the carpeting were not subject to the requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code. Ricciardelli v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Actions</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When insufficient contract enforceable.</b> - A contract which is otherwise insufficient may still be enforceable if party against whom enforcement is sought admits by pleading or testimony that a contract of sale was in fact made. Jackson v. Meadows, 153 Ga. App. 1, 264 S.E.2d 503 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A contract which is within statute of frauds at time of filing petition or cross action can become enforceable by admissions in the case itself by party charged, but not by admissions made outside the case prior to filing of petition or cross action. Garrison v. Piatt, 113 Ga. App. 94, 147 S.E.2d 374 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to object to goods constituted acceptance and formed contract.</b> - Under the merchant rule in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201(2), a hospital's failure to object in writing to a medical supplier's invoice for pumps within ten days of receipt constituted the hospital's acceptance of the goods and formed an enforceable contract, even though the hospital's purchase order noted that the purchase was contingent on approval by the hospital's board of directors. Ardus Med., Inc. v. Emanuel County Hosp. Auth., 558 F. Supp. 2d 1301 (S.D. Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party admitting contract may not claim benefit of statute of frauds.</b> - Party charged cannot admit fact of parol contract and at same time claim benefit of statute of frauds. Garrison v. Piatt, 113 Ga. App. 94, 147 S.E.2d 374 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201(3)(b) was designed to prevent the statute of frauds itself from becoming an aid to fraud, by prohibiting one claiming the benefit of the statute who admits in the case the oral contract sued upon. Garrison v. Piatt, 113 Ga. App. 94, 147 S.E.2d 374 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An oral agreement for the sale of a horse for $35,000 was enforceable under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201(3)(b); the seller admitted that a contract was made for the sale of one horse. Rowland v. Scarborough Farms, LLC, 285 Ga. App. 831, 648 S.E.2d 151 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Petition for enforcement of contract otherwise valid not demurrable.</b> - Because it is clearly the intent of the legislature that enforceability of contract, which on its face may be within statute of frauds, is tested by answer, testimony, or plea of party charged, and not merely by allegations in the petition or cross action brought to enforce the contract, it follows that a petition upon such a contract which is valid in other respects is not demurrable because it shows on its face that it is within the statute of frauds. Garrison v. Piatt, 113 Ga. App. 94, 147 S.E.2d 374 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement found outside of statute of frauds due to partial performance.</b> See Dan Gurney Indus., Inc. v. Southeastern Wheels, Inc., 168 Ga. App. 504, 308 S.E.2d 637 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol defense.</b> - In action on account by seller, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201 does not prohibit setting up by parol evidence a defense based upon term of contract of sale as to when payments on account become due. Giant Peanut Co. v. Carolina Chems., Inc., 129 Ga. App. 718, 200 S.E.2d 918 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Secured transactions.</b> - While it appeared that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-24, rather than O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725, would most likely apply to defendant collection attorney's state court deficiency action against plaintiff consumer, and it was not for the federal court to say what the Georgia courts would hold, the uncertainty meant there was no intentional unfair conduct and the consumer's Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claim was dismissed; language in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201 excluded "secured transactions" from <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201. Almand v. Reynolds &amp; Robin, P.C., 485 F. Supp. 2d 1361 (M.D. Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment.</b> - Lender and attorney were properly granted summary judgment against a home buyer's breach of contract, fraud, and conspiracy claims, as: (1) there was no evidence of a written purchase agreement for the home and the land it was placed on; and (2) a simple reading of the contract by the buyer would have protected against any alleged misrepresentations; moreover, to the extent that the home buyer's claim of a conspiracy depended upon the viability of the fraud and breach of contract claims, it also failed. Parrish v. Jackson W. Jones, P.C., 278 Ga. App. 645, 629 S.E.2d 468 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because an oral contract concerning the disposal of car skeletons on property operated as a junkyard did not violate the O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-201 and 11-2-725, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against a seller on his counterclaim for fraud, due to the option holder's repudiation of the contract in filing for specific performance. Henry v. Blankenship, 284 Ga. App. 578, 644 S.E.2d 419 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Consideration given to official comments.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-202 was adopted verbatim from <span class="s1">§</span> 2-202 of the Uniform Commercial Code and therefore, in its application by Georgia courts, intentions of drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code as evidenced in official comments to it should be given due consideration.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of allowing challenges to specific agreements by extrinsic evidence.</b> - In contracts which set out fairly specific quantity, price, and time specifications, to allow such specific agreements to be challenged by extrinsic evidence might jeopardize certainty of contractual duties which parties have right to rely on. Southern Concrete Servs., Inc. v. Mableton Contractors, 407 F. Supp. 581 (N.D. Ga. 1975), aff'd, 569 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir. 1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence admissible to show written confirmation incorrectly stated terms of prior oral agreement.</b> - Recognizing extensive use of oral contracts in securities and commodities markets it is clear that if use of oral contracts is to be fostered, party seeking to enforce oral contract should not be prevented from doing so merely because an alleged written confirmation incorrectly stated terms of prior oral contract. If the law was construed differently, a party to an oral contract could easily elude enforcement by sending a confirmatory memorandum which incorrectly stated all terms of prior oral contract. Edwards v. Wilbur-Ellis Co., 379 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Ga. 1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract established by memorandum, correspondence, and agreement despite indefinite quantity term.</b> - Where the evidence demonstrated that both parties intended a requirements contract based on purchaser's good faith needs for the trademarked yarns and the existence of this contract was established by a memorandum, the correspondence between the parties, and a trademark licensing agreement which was to remain in effect subject to cancellation by either party on 90 days' notice, the indefiniteness of the written quantity term did not invalidate the contract. O.N. Jonas Co. v. Badische Corp., 706 F.2d 1161 (11th Cir. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actual agreement not contained in one document.</b> - Trial court correctly considered matters outside a buyer's request for quotation (RFQ) to determine the intended final obligations of the buyer and a seller under their agreement because the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the parties' actual agreement was not contained in any one document, such as the RFQ, since the RFQ anticipated that necessary terms such as material specifications, quantities, pricing information, and delivery dates would be supplied as part of the bidding and ordering process; because before, during, and after accepting the seller's bid, the buyer was aware of the seller's overseas supply chain and did not object to the seller's stated reliance on a promised three-month forecast to obtain material, the trial court did not err in construing the written terms of the contract in light of that understanding and thereby denying the buyer cover damages for items exceeding the usage data provided to the seller.

<p class="p4"><b>Where parties disagree on terms, evidence of prior oral agreement admissible.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-202 forbids use of evidence of prior agreements only with respect to terms in confirmatory memoranda to which parties agree, and where parties disagree on every term in alleged confirmatory memorandum, this section will not prohibit use of evidence of any prior agreement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where implied warranties are properly excluded, evidence of prior or contemporaneous parol agreements not admissible.</b> - Where provisions of contract meet requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-316 and no implied warranty arises out of the transaction, either as to merchantability or as to fitness for a particular purpose, evidence of a contradictory prior or contemporaneous parol agreement is prohibited.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of samples admitted to support claim of breach of express warranty by sample.</b> - Because there was no indication that the written contract was a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties, and because the terms expressed by the sample did not contradict those in the written contract, the parol evidence rule did not prevent the admission of evidence of peanut samples sent by the seller to describe what the buyer would receive in bulk shipment to provide a foundation for the claim against the seller for breach of express warranty by sample. Alimenta (U.S.A.), Inc. v. Anheuser-Busch Cos., 803 F.2d 1160 (11th Cir. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unambiguous agreement cannot be modified.</b> - Where the clear intention of the parties was that if they could not agree upon a price, seller could then entertain bona fide purchase offers from any third party, buyer cannot modify that unambiguous agreement by use of parol evidence to additionally require the bona fide offer to come from a federally registered peanut handler.

<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Parol evidence admissible if no final sales price.</b> - Where written contracts were not intended by the parties as a complete and exclusive statement of the agreed upon terms, because only a floor price, rather than the final sales price, was stated, parol evidence as to the parties' prescribed method for fixing the final price was admissible. Golden Peanut Co. v. Bass, 275 Ga. 145, 563 S.E.2d 116 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 886, 123 S. Ct. 32, 154 L. Ed. 2d 146 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Customs of trade considered in interpreting contract terms.</b> - Customs of trade should be relevant to interpretation of certain terms of contract, and should be considered in determining what variation in specifications is considered acceptable. Southern Concrete Servs., Inc. v. Mableton Contractors, 407 F. Supp. 581 (N.D. Ga. 1975), aff'd, 569 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir. 1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Modification need not be in writing.</b> - Modification or restitution of the remedy available for breach of warranty need not be in writing. Parole evidence to show the usage of the trade to explain or supplement the available remedies for breach of warranty was improperly excluded. Topeka Mach. Exch., Inc. v. Stoler Indus., Inc., 220 Ga. App. 799, 470 S.E.2d 250 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When contract terms and trade usage construed as consistent.</b> - The express terms of a contract and trade usage shall be construed as consistent with each other only when such construction is reasonable and a construction which negates the express terms of the contract by allowing unilateral abandonment of its specifications is patently unreasonable. Golden Peanut Co. v. Hunt, 203 Ga. App. 469, 416 S.E.2d 896 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assumption that parties intend specific price and quantity terms observed.</b> - Though courts are free to apply custom and trade usage in interpreting terms, it should be assumed that specifications in contract as to quantity and price are intended to be observed by parties and unilateral right to make major departure from such specifications must be expressly agreed to in written contract. Southern Concrete Servs., Inc. v. Mableton Contractors, 407 F. Supp. 581 (N.D. Ga. 1975), aff'd, 569 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir. 1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No need to negate applicability of trade usage to preserve written price and quantity terms.</b> - If clause expressly negating applicability of trade usage is necessary to preserve specified price and quantity terms of a contract, the purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code will be quickly frustrated, for while consideration of commercial custom is an important aid in interpretation of terms of a contract, parties will have no choice but to foreclose use of such an aid if inevitable result of such consideration is to have explicit contracts negated by an evidentiary free-for-all. Southern Concrete Servs., Inc. v. Mableton Contractors, 407 F. Supp. 581 (N.D. Ga. 1975), aff'd, 589 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir. 1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Common-law rule not abrogated.</b> - The so called "gap filler" provision in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-204(3) does not obliterate the common law rule that the first requirement of law of a valid contract is that there must be a meeting of the minds of the parties and mutuality, and the agreement must be expressed plainly and explicitly enough to show what the parties agree upon; a contract cannot be enforced if its terms are incomplete or incomprehensible. Drug Line v. Sero-Immuno Diagnostics, Inc., 217 Ga. App. 530, 458 S.E.2d 170 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Formalities required for contract formation reduced.</b> - The Uniform Commercial Code makes contracts easier to form and imposes a wider range of options than before; parties may form a contract through conduct rather than merely through the exchange of communications constituting "offer and acceptance." D.N. Garner Co. v. Georgia Palm Beach Aluminum Window Corp., 233 Ga. App. 252, 504 S.E.2d 70 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a case in which a steel company signed a purchase order from a general contractor after it had rejected the terms of the purchase order and had submitted a counter-offer to the general contractor, a district court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the general contractor, correctly concluded that the record evidence disclosed no material fact in dispute; no reasonable jury could find that the general contractor and the steel company agreed to terms of a steel supply contract for the construction project. The requirement for a meeting of the minds necessary under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-3-2 had not been met, and there was no agreement between the parties under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-204. South Cent. Steel, Inc. v. McKnight Constr. Co.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Jan. 25, 2008)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No meeting of the minds or mutuality established.</b> - In a cottonseed buyer's suit for breach of contract against a cottonseed seller, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the seller as no mutuality as to the contract terms existed since the buyer never obtained credit approval. Further, the buyer's reliance on the purported promise was unreasonable as a matter of law; thus, promissory estoppel did not apply as the buyer never received credit approval, which was an essential element of the cottonseed business. AgriCommodities, Inc. v. J. D. Heiskell &amp; Co., 297 Ga. App. 210, 676 S.E.2d 847 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Valid, enforceable contract.</b> - Written agreement signed by party against whom enforcement is sought constitutes valid, enforceable contract if the writing shows that a contract has been agreed to and there is a reasonably certain basis for granting relief. Mitchell-Huntley Cotton Co. v. Lawson, 377 F. Supp. 661 (M.D. Ga. 1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a car dealer admitted that a contract existed for the sale of a specific quantity of goods, namely, one vehicle, via the dealer's representative's deposition, but on different terms and conditions than those alleged by the car's potential buyer, the oral agreement between the parties was enforceable under the exception to the statute of frauds set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-201(3)(b). Jones v. Baran Co., LLC, 290 Ga. App. 578, 660 S.E.2d 420 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-204(3), a contract between a hospital and medical supplier consisting of a contingency-based purchase order and an invoice did not fail for indefiniteness because, by the deliverance of the goods and the acceptance of the goods without protest in writing within ten days of receipt, the parties were deemed to have agreed upon quantity and price terms. Ardus Med., Inc. v. Emanuel County Hosp. Auth., 558 F. Supp. 2d 1301 (S.D. Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Price may be left for ascertainment by certain and exact method.</b> - If price of goods is fixed and delivery is perfect a contract is executed. Fact that price is to be ascertained by a certain and exact method subsequent to contract does not affect validity or completeness of the sale, nor does fact that sale is on credit. Comstock v. Tarbush, 73 Ga. App. 724, 37 S.E.2d 925 (1946)(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where parties consented as to goods to be sold, price, and delivery,</b> sale was completed. Cordell v. Macon Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 56 Ga. App. 117, 192 S.E. 228 (1937)(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract for cotton was binding, though cotton not planted at time.</b> - Where written contracts, on their face, show clearly that parties intended to enter into contracts for sale of cotton, and testimony of all of parties indicated that each intended to make a binding contract for sale of cotton at time contracts were executed, then it is clear that contracts were formed regardless of whether the cotton had in fact been planted at time of execution. R.N. Kelly Cotton Merchant, Inc. v. York, 379 F. Supp. 1075 (M.D. Ga. 1973), aff'd, 494 F.2d 41 (5th Cir. 1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidentiary issues.</b> - Summary judgment was precluded where material issues of fact existed as to whether there was an acceptance of a written offer of a manufacturer to furnish and install windows for a project and whether the offer was for a particular window model or for windows meeting project specifications. D.N. Garner Co. v. Georgia Palm Beach Aluminum Window Corp., 233 Ga. App. 252, 504 S.E.2d 70 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Purchase order as contract.</b> - Where the purchase order from a general contractor contained terms at variance with the initial proposal from the subcontractor, and following receipt of the purchase order, the subcontractor lodged no objection to its terms, but proceeded to manufacture the parts ordered and sent a supervisor to the job site, the trial court did not err in finding that the purchase order (including the plans and specs), rather than the proposal, constituted the contract between the parties.

<p class="p4"><b>Written agreement, rather than oral agreement, was contract to be followed.</b> - Jury's finding that the aircraft purchase agreement (APA), rather than an oral agreement, was the contract between the parties was supported by the evidence because the plaintiff's own complaint asserted that the APA was the agreement between the parties and the Uniform Commercial Code, specifically O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-207, requires the writing to be followed.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as otherwise provided in Code Section 11-9-406, unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on the other party by the contract, or impair materially the other party's chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of the assignor's entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) of this Code section unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of "the contract" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(5)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An assignment of "the contract" or of "all my rights under the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by the assignee to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(6)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his or her rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Code Section 11-2-609).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>"Unconscionable" defined.</b> - "Unconscionable" under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-302 means "one-sided contracts." R.C. Craig, Ltd. v. Ships of Sea, Inc., 345 F.

<p class="p4">An unconscionable contract is such an agreement as no sane man not acting under a delusion would make, and that no honest man would take advantage of. R.L. Kimsey Cotton Co. v. Ferguson, 233 Ga. 962, 214 S.E.2d 360 (1975); Stefan Jewelers, Inc. v. Electro-Protective Corp., 161 Ga. App. 385, 288 S.E.2d 667 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Section not intended merely to relieve party from bad bargain.</b> - If court determines as a matter of law that provision of a contract is unconscionable when made, it may, among other things, so limit the application of any unconscionable provision to avoid an unconscionable result, but O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-302 is not designed merely to relieve a party of a bad bargain.

<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of courts over enforcement of sales contracts.</b> - While it is a general rule in this state that parties may contract as they please subject to the exceptions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-8-1 et seq., O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-302 modifies this general rule that parties are free to make whatever contracts they please so long as there is no fraud or illegality by giving the courts discretion to refuse to enforce sales contracts under Georgia Uniform Commercial Code, in whole or in part, which they find to be "unconscionable."

<p class="p4"><b>Test for unconscionability.</b> - The basic test is whether, in light of general commercial background and commercial needs of particular trade or case, clauses involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under circumstances existing at the time of making of contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Contract provision not unconscionable.</b> - Contract provision that provider of burglar alarm service "shall not be liable for" and jeweler "waives any rights against [provider] on account of any loss" was not unconscionable, particularly with reference to a theft by a third party, seemingly performed by professionals, in cutting the phone lines on which the service was based, thereafter cutting into the roof of the building, bypassing this protective barrier and then cutting the wire to the outside alarm bell.

<p class="p4"><b>Guaranty not unconscionable.</b> - When the owner of a Chapter 11 debtor signed a personal guaranty of the debtor's debt, which included a waiver of defenses clause, in return for the withdrawal of a motion by a creditor for the appointment of a trustee, the guaranty was not unconscionable because the guaranty went through several iterations, the owner read the guaranty's final terms, and the owner discussed the guaranty with counsel.

<p class="p4"><b>Bank charges not unconscionable.</b> - While plaintiff bank customers alleged defendant bank had a practice of manipulating the posting of transactions to impose overdraft fees, there was no substantive unconscionability under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-302 as the deposit agreement was consistent with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-303(b) as to the order items were paid.

<p class="p4"><b>Motor vehicle title pawn transaction.</b> - Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-302 by its terms applies to transactions involving a sale, there is nothing unconscionable about a pawn ticket that authorizes the pawnbroker to sell the pawned vehicle following the debtor's default.

<p class="p4"><b>Contract to sell water at fixed price.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-305 comes into play only where a contract for sale is concluded with an open-price term. Where water is offered for sale by a city at a fixed price and nonresident plaintiffs accept the offer at that fixed price, it cannot be said that the city sells water to plaintiffs pursuant to an open price term contract.

<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-2-306(1) precludes a finding that a contract for requirements is too indefinite,</b> since the quantity is determined by the actual good faith requirements of the particular party. O.N. Jonas Co. v. Badische Corp., 706 F.2d 1161 (11th Cir. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract established by memorandum, correspondence, and agreement despite indefinite quantity term.</b> - Where the evidence demonstrated that both parties intended a requirements contract based on purchaser's good faith needs for the trademarked yarns and the existence of this contract was established by a memorandum, the correspondence between the parties, and a trademark licensing agreement which was to remain in effect subject to cancellation by either party on 90 days' notice, the indefiniteness of the written quantity term did not invalidate the contract.

<p class="p11">(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How warranties raised.</b> - Implied warranty is raised by statute, while express warranty is by contract. Stewart v. Gainesville Glass Co., 131 Ga. App. 747, 206 S.E.2d 857 (1974), aff'd, 233 Ga. 578, 212 S.E.2d 377 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A warranty is a statement of representation</b> made by the seller of goods contemporaneously with and as a part of the contract of sale, though collateral to the express object of it, having reference to the character, quality, or title to the goods and by which the seller promises or undertakes to insure that certain facts are or shall be as the seller then represents them. North Ga. Ready Mix Concrete Co. v. L &amp; L Constr., Inc., 235 Ga. App. 68, 508 S.E.2d 722 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Representation as to quality, character, or title.</b> - An express warranty is a representation or statement made by seller at time of sale and as a part thereof, having reference to quality, character, or title to goods, and is part of the transaction between seller and purchaser. Stewart v. Gainesville Glass Co., 131 Ga. App. 747, 206 S.E.2d 857 (1974), aff'd, 233 Ga. 578, 212 S.E.2d 377 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Test.</b> - Decisive test in determining whether language used is mere expression of opinion or warranty, is whether it purported to state fact upon which it may fairly be presumed seller expected buyer to rely, and upon which buyer would ordinarily rely. If language used is of that character, fact of reliance on part of buyer and presumption of intent on part of seller which the law would raise in such case would operate to create warranty. Bell v. Menzies, 110 Ga. App. 436, 138 S.E.2d 731 (1964); Moore v. Berry, 217 Ga. App. 697, 458 S.E.2d 879 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to limit warranty</b> made or to exclude any implied warranties may give rise to liability under either O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-313 or 11-2-314. Jones v. Cranman's Sporting Goods, 142 Ga. App. 838, 237 S.E.2d 402 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Express and implied warranties.</b> - A warranty may be express or implied; it is the former when created by the apt and explicit statements of the seller; it is the latter when the law derives it by implication or inference from the nature of the transaction or the relative situation or circumstances of the parties. North Ga. Ready Mix Concrete Co. v. L &amp; L Constr., Inc., 235 Ga. App. 68, 508 S.E.2d 722 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in denying a corporation's motion for summary judgment on an individual's claim for breach of an express warranty when the individual's three-wheeled motorized scooter tipped over while the individual was operating the scooter in the individual's yard as the individual failed to present any evidence that the scooter was generally unsuitable for use on non-paved and sloped surfaces and, therefore, the individual had not identified any evidence that the scooter did not conform to a salesperson's description. Foothills Pharms., Inc. v. Powers, 313 Ga. App. 630, 722 S.E.2d 331 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Description of vehicle as new created express warranty.</b> Horne v. Claude Ray Ford Sales, Inc., 162 Ga. App. 329, 290 S.E.2d 497 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Contract for sale of car describing it as new created express warranty to that effect, which was not negated by disclaimer of express warranties in same contract. Century Dodge, Inc. v. Mobley, 155 Ga. App. 712, 272 S.E.2d 502 (1980); Thompson v. Huckabee Auto Co., 190 Ga. App. 540, 379 S.E.2d 411 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a retail sales contract described a car as new, neither specific disclaimer of express or implied warranties nor "sold as is" language could negate the express warranty that the car was new. Rivers v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 214 Ga. App. 880, 449 S.E.2d 337 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error as to actual mileage of automobile.</b> - The defendant did not breach any express warranty concerning the actual mileage of an automobile where, at the time it made a statement regarding an odometer reading, it had no knowledge or any reason to believe that the true mileage differed from the mileage shown on the odometer. Charles Evans Nissan, Inc. v. Trussell Ford-Mazda, Inc., 200 Ga. App. 432, 408 S.E.2d 419, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 895, 408 S.E.2d 419 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disclaimer in same contract.</b> - It is unreasonable to allow express warranty to be negated by disclaimer in same contract. Century Dodge, Inc. v. Mobley, 155 Ga. App. 712, 272 S.E.2d 502 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The issuance of certificates of title pursuant to O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>40-3-28 of the motor vehicles law does not, as a matter of law, negate the existence of express or implied warranties of title which the seller gives the purchaser in the course of their dealings. Hudson v. Gaines, 199 Ga. App. 70, 403 S.E.2d 852 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Learned intermediary doctrine.</b> - Plaintiff's breach of warranty claims against a drug manufacturer to the extent the claims were based upon failure to provide accurate or sufficient information regarding the use of the drug to the decedent, were barred by the learned intermediary doctrine, but the claims were not barred to the extent the claims were based upon failure to provide accurate or sufficient information regarding the use of the drug to others.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statements deemed not mere sales talk or opinion.</b> - Statements by defendant's sales clerk that a product was "probably the safest one on the market" and that there was "no way you [could] fall" from it were sufficient to create an express warranty. Moore v. Berry, 217 Ga. App. 697, 458 S.E.2d 879 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Privity between manufacturer and ultimate consumer.</b> - To the extent the plaintiff's express warranty claim against a drug manufacturer was based upon affirmations of fact or promises to the decedent, the plaintiff asserted a claim upon which relief could be granted because a manufacturer could extend an express warranty to the ultimate consumer.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admission of evidence of samples.</b> - Because there was no indication that the written contract was a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties, and because the terms expressed by the sample did not contradict those in the written contract, the parol evidence rule did not prevent the admission of evidence of the peanut samples sent by the seller to describe what the buyer would receive in bulk shipment to provide a foundation for the claim against the seller for breach of express warranty by sample. Alimenta (U.S.A.), Inc. v. Anheuser-Busch Cos., 803 F.2d 1160 (11th Cir. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence.</b> - A disclaimer of warranty in an equipment purchase contract barred any claim that the dealer made an express warranty that the equipment would be sold in "working" condition based on oral representations where the contract required that any warranty be contained in a separate writing.

<p class="p4"><b>Damages.</b> - In a consumer's suit against a car dealer for breach of an express warranty, regarding the sale of a used car which the dealer's salesman falsely represented had not been in a wreck, it was not error for the trial court to grant a directed verdict to the dealer because, while the salesman's representation was an express warranty, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-313(1)(a), the consumer offered no probative evidence of damages.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity between the provisions, decisions under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4135 and former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 96-301 and 96-307 are included in the annotations to this section. Since this section does not expressly exclude manufacturers from its coverage, cases decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-307 have been included here. See Official Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code <span class="s1">§</span> 2-314.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 96-307 to distribute losses.</b> - Purpose of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-307 was that enterprise which causes losses should lift them from the individual victims and distribute them widely among those who benefit from activities of the enterprise. Wood v. Hub Motor Co., 110 Ga. App. 101, 137 S.E.2d 674 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranty is raised by statute,</b> while express warranty is by contract. Stewart v. Gainesville Glass Co., 131 Ga. App. 747, 206 S.E.2d 857 (1974), aff'd, 233 Ga. 578, 212 S.E.2d 377 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statutory implied warranty is an obligation that the law places upon a party as a result of some transaction entered into; it is not a contractual obligation. Wood v. Hub Motor Co., 110 Ga. App. 101, 137 S.E.2d 674 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because granite blocks were movable at the time of identification of the contract, they were "goods" under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314, and an implied warranty of merchantability applied to their sale. Willis Mining, Inc. v. Noggle, 235 Ga. App. 747, 509 S.E.2d 731 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under Georgia's Uniform Commercial Code, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314(1), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for the goods' sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. That warranty protects consumers from defects or conditions existing at the time of sale. Paulk v. Thomasville Ford Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 317 Ga. App. 780, 732 S.E.2d 297 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Warranties exist unless excepted.</b> - Implied warranties exist unless expressly or from nature of transaction excepted. Wilson v. Eargle, 98 Ga. App. 241, 105 S.E.2d 474 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If there is no express covenant of warranty, purchaser must exercise caution in detecting defects, but seller in all cases, unless expressed or from the nature of the transaction excepted, warrants it has title and right to sell, that article sold is merchantable and reasonably suited to use intended, and that seller knows of no latent defects undisclosed. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936); Wilkinson v. Rich's, Inc., 77 Ga. App. 239, 48 S.E.2d 552 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranty remains effective for a reasonable time.</b> Wood v. Hub Motor Co., 110 Ga. 101, 137 S.E.2d 674 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranties warrant against defects or conditions existing at the time of sale,</b> but do not provide a warranty of continuing serviceability. Jones v. Marcus, 217 Ga. App. 372, 457 S.E.2d 271 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranties inapplicable to settlement agreements.</b> - Seller sued a buyer who rejected the seller's goods; the parties settled. As the parties' agreement was a contract to settle litigation, with any sale of goods merely incidental, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-314 and 11-2-315, did not apply to their settlement agreement. Ole Mexican Foods, Inc. v. Hanson Staple Co., 285 Ga. 288, 676 S.E.2d 169 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence negated buyer's claim that vehicle was unmerchantable at time of sale.</b> - Summary judgment for the seller of a vehicle was proper in a case in which the buyer claimed breach of implied warranties under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314; the buyer's complaints were minor and did not render the vehicle unusable, and the vehicle had 57,000 miles on it when the buyer purchased it, and the fact that the buyer drove it 25,000 more miles before abandoning it at the seller's lot negated the claim that the vehicle was unmerchantable when purchased. Soto v. CarMax Auto Superstores, Inc., 271 Ga. App. 813, 611 S.E.2d 108 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parties may expressly broaden or narrow warranty.</b> - Parties may expressly agree on provisions of contract and extent of warranty, which may be more limited or more extensive than implied warranty of law. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Vendor may act in good faith in transaction, and yet violate O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>11-2-314. A.D.L. Sales Co. v. Gailey, 48 Ga. App. 798, 173 S.E. 734 (1934) (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4135).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Patent, discoverable, or disclosed latent defects.</b> - Implied warranty is a guaranty against loss only from latent defects. The law of implied warranty will not avail against patent defects, nor against latent defects which are either disclosed or are discoverable by exercise of caution on part of purchaser. Where property is brought under an implied warranty that it is reasonably suited to the use intended, an acceptance by the purchaser waives all defects discovered by the purchaser, or which by exercise of ordinary care and prudence, the purchaser might have discovered before delivery. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936); Wilkinson v. Rich's, Inc., 77 Ga. App. 239, 48 S.E.2d 552 (1948); Smith v. Northeast Ga. Fair Ass'n, 85 Ga. App. 32, 67 S.E.2d 836 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301); Moore v. Berry, 217 Ga. App. 697, 458 S.E.2d 879 (1995);. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Implied warranty of fitness of thing sold for ordinary use, does not embrace defects discoverable by ordinary prudence and care. Smith v. Northeast Ga. Fair Ass'n, 85 Ga. App. 32, 67 S.E.2d 836 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action by a customer against a drugstore for burns suffered when bleach spilled from a bottle as the customer removed it from a shelf, the customer's claim was not defeated by failure to exercise care for the customer's own safety since the bleach was located at a height above the customer's eye level and there was no patent or obvious defect; reversing A.B.C. Drug Co. v. Monroe, 214 Ga. App. 136, 447 S.E.2d 315 (1994). Keaton v. A.B.C. Drug Co., 266 Ga. 385, 467 S.E.2d 558 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defects not ascertainable by examination of property.</b> - The law imposes upon vendee the duty of exercising caution in detecting defects, and hence it is a well-established rule that where defect is patent, or could have been ascertained by exercise of diligence, there can be no recovery upon ground of an implied warranty and in all such cases the doctrine of caveat emptor applies; but in cases of latent defects, the existence of which cannot be ascertained by an examination of the property, the law protects a purchaser by imposing upon vendor an implied warranty, whenever the defect is of such a nature as to render article sold unsuited to use intended, and in cases of latent defects, therefore, the doctrine of caveat venditor applies. Williams v. Ballenger, 87 Ga. App. 255, 73 S.E.2d 509 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the seller's argument that no warranty existed because the buyer inspected the blocks the buyer was buying and used own judgment in selecting purchases was relevant to an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, it was not applicable to the warranty of merchantability at issue. Since the implied warranty of merchantability was not clearly disclaimed, it applied to this sale of goods absent one of the exceptions enumerated in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-316(3). Willis Mining, Inc. v. Noggle, 235 Ga. App. 747, 509 S.E.2d 731 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of common article.</b> - In sale of common article there is always an implied warranty that it is made of good material and reasonably fit to be employed in use for which it is designed by maker. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defective container or packaging.</b> - In an action by a customer against a drugstore for burns suffered when bleach spilled from a bottle as she removed it from a shelf, the jury was authorized to find a breach of implied warranty because, as a merchant of bleach, the store was required to adequately contain and package the bleach that it sold and bleach which spills from a loose cap is not adequately contained or packaged; reversing A.B.C. Drug Co. v. Monroe, 214 Ga. App. 136, 447 S.E.2d 315 (1994). Keaton v. A.B.C. Drug Co., 266 Ga. 385, 467 S.E.2d 558 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adaption of machine to uses for which it is made</b> is always warranted. A.D.L. Sales Co. v. Gailey, 48 Ga. App. 798, 173 S.E. 734 (1934) (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4135(2)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Used or second-hand goods.</b> - When the article even though used or second-hand is sold by one who "is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind," an implied warranty of merchantability attaches to the sale under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314 unless excluded or modified by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-316. Georgia Timberlands, Inc. v. Southern Airways Co., 125 Ga. App. 404, 188 S.E.2d 108 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Implied warranty of merchantability does not base distinctions upon whether or not goods are sold in original packages. Pierce v. Liberty Furn. Co., 141 Ga. App. 175, 233 S.E.2d 33 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Instruction manual accompanying product.</b> - Under warranty provisions of Uniform Commercial Code, where a product is sold which is to be installed by the consumer, written instructions that accompany it create an implied warranty that it will be fit for ordinary purpose for which it is used and will be safely operable when installed in accordance with such directions. Reddick v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 295 F. Supp. 243 (S.D. Ga. 1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When contract originates in self-service store.</b> - Where defendant self-service store offered soft drinks for sale by placing them on its shelf, contract for sale of goods came into being when plaintiff accepted offer by taking physical possession thereof with intent to pay for them; and from that moment forward implied warranties of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314 were applicable. Fender v. Colonial Stores, Inc., 138 Ga. App. 31, 225 S.E.2d 691 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Blood furnished by hospital in course of treatment</b> is not a sales transaction covered by implied warranty under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314. Lovett v. Emory Univ., Inc., 116 Ga. App. 277, 156 S.E.2d 923 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Medical center's furnishing of facility for use in connection with surgery</b> to install a plate device to stabilize plaintiff's spine was a transaction involving "services and labor with an incidental furnishing of equipment and materials" and, as such, the Uniform Commercial Code had no application. McCombs v. Southern Regional Medical Ctr., Inc., 233 Ga. App. 676, 504 S.E.2d 747 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distributor of anti-psychotic drug.</b> - The distributor of an anti-psychotic drug could not be held liable for the suicide of a patient based on warranty claims because it neither manufactured nor prescribed the drug. Presto v. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., 226 Ga. App. 547, 487 S.E.2d 70 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Pharmaceutical products.</b> - Patient who died after taking medicine which a pharmaceutical manufacturer gave to the doctor and which the doctor gave to the patient was not entitled to an extension of any implied warranty existing between the manufacturer and the doctor, and the appellate court upheld the trial court's judgment dismissing claims the patient's spouse filed against the manufacturer, alleging breach of express and implied warranties, but reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the husband's claims against the manufacturer alleging strict liability and negligent failure to warn. Bryant v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., 262 Ga. App. 401, 585 S.E.2d 723 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Federal law on medical devices preempted implied warranty.</b> - Medical Device Amendments, 21 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 360k, preempted state law claims in a products liability case alleging an implied warranty of merchantability under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314 with respect to a Precision Spinal Cord Stimulator medical device. Horn v. Boston Sci. Neuromodulation Corp.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(S.D. Ga. Aug. 26, 2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Learned intermediary" doctrine.</b> - The manufacturer of an anti-psychotic drug could not be held liable for the suicide of a patient under any warranty claim because of the "learned intermediary" doctrine, absent some showing that the product itself was defective. Presto v. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., 226 Ga. App. 547, 487 S.E.2d 70 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plaintiff's breach of warranty claims against a drug manufacturer, to the extent the claims were based upon failure to provide accurate or sufficient information regarding the use of the drug to the decedent, were barred by the learned intermediary doctrine but the claims were not barred to the extent the claims were based upon failure to provide accurate or sufficient information regarding the use of the drug to others. Lee v. Mylan Inc., 806 F. Supp. 2d 1320 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 15, 2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Handgun used to accidentally kill another.</b> - Handgun with cocked hammer which was discovered by three-year-old, who pulled the trigger and thereby killed another child, could not be considered "not merchantable and not reasonably suited to the use intended" since the gun performed exactly as intended - when the hammer was cocked and the trigger was pulled, it fired.

<p class="p4"><b>Strict liability of manufacturer distinguished.</b> - Establishment of the implied warranty of merchantability as applied to a seller under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314 is not the same as the strict liability imposed on a manufacturer under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-1-11.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred in entering summary judgment for a manufacturer on the owners' breach of the implied warranty of merchantability claim as there were triable issues as to the driveability of a car at the time of its delivery where an owner brought the vehicle to the dealership approximately one month after the owner picked it up and had driven only 1,923 miles, and, among other things, there was a recurrant problem with the coolant lamp.

<p class="p4">Defendant's compliance with plaintiff's specifications did not eliminate the defendant's duty to supply merchantable pallets; as there were genuine issues of material fact regarding plaintiff's claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, summary judgment was inappropriate. Plaintiff's expert testimony indicated that many pallet manufacturers were aware of mold issues caused by surface moisture on green heat-treated wood and, as a result, were drying pallets used for export, however, neither the pallet manufacturing standards nor the heat-treatment standards required any specific moisture content; this conflicting evidence raised a question of fact as to whether pallets with high moisture content were defective and unfit for shipping products overseas.

<p class="p4">In a products liability diversity action brought on the theory of breach of implied warranty of merchantability, Georgia procedural law, which looked to the lex loci delicti, controlled the claim.

<p class="p4">Purchaser did not have a claim for breach of implied warranty against the manufacturers of component parts of the purchaser's recreational vehicle because there was no privity between the manufacturers and the purchaser.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Privity between manufacturer and ultimate consumer.</b> - Because the plaintiff established privity with respect to an express warranty claim against a drug manufacturer based upon affirmations of fact or promises to the decedent, the plaintiff also could bring claims for the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Lee v. Mylan Inc., 806 F. Supp. 2d 1320 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 15, 2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Warranty issued through dealer as part of sale.</b> - Although in Georgia privity is required in order to impose liability under the theory of express or implied warranty, where an automobile manufacturer, through its authorized dealer issues to a purchaser of one of its automobiles from such dealer, admittedly as a part of the sale, a warranty by the manufacturer running to the purchaser, privity exists and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314 becomes operative. Jones v. Cranman's Sporting Goods, 142 Ga. App. 838, 237 S.E.2d 402 (1977); Chrysler Corp. v. Wilson Plumbing Co., 132 Ga. App. 435, 208 S.E.2d 321 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ordinarily, there is no implied warranty existing between manufacturer and purchaser of automobile when there is no privity between the two, yet where an automobile manufacturer, through its authorized dealer, issues to a purchaser a warranty by the manufacturer to said purchaser, the implied warranty statute becomes operative. Ford Motor Co. v. Lee, 137 Ga. App. 486, 224 S.E.2d 168, aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 237 Ga. 554, 229 S.E.2d 379 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dealer's warranty not binding on manufacturer.</b> - Absent a showing of a de facto principal/agent relationship between an automobile manufacturer and its authorized dealer, a warranty made by the dealer for repair work done on a used vehicle would not extend any responsibility to the manufacturer. Lauria v. Ford Motor Co., 169 Ga. App. 203, 312 S.E.2d 190 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No privity meant no duty to warn.</b> - Claim, based on warranty law, that a hospital had a duty to warn regarding the effects of discontinuing prescription drug use was meritless since the hospital neither manufactured nor prescribed the drug.

<p class="p4"><b>Emotional distress.</b> - Summary judgment, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56(c), to a restaurant was properly granted by a trial court in an action by a restaurant patron, alleging emotional distress when the patron discovered two blood spots on the french fry container, fearing that the patron would contract HIV or hepatitis, because the patron failed to provide evidence of more than the patron's "fear" of exposure to the diseases; accordingly, the patron's claims for negligence, negligence per se, and breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-1-23 and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-314, failed due to the patron's failure to meet the damages requirement.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity between the provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301 are included in the annotations for this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranty is raised by statute,</b> while express warranty is by contract. Stewart v. Gainesville Glass Co., 131 Ga. App. 747, 206 S.E.2d 857 (1974), aff'd, 233 Ga. 578, 212 S.E.2d 377 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What is warranted.</b> - Warranty of fitness warrants that goods sold are suitable for special purpose of buyer. Multivision N.W., Inc. v. Jerrold Elecs. Corp., 356 F. Supp. 207 (N.D. Ga. 1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Buying goods for general resale is not a "particular purpose"</b> within meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-315. Bruce v. Calhoun First Nat'l Bank, 134 Ga. App. 790, 216 S.E.2d 622 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for creation of warranty of fitness.</b> - In order to create implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-315 requires that seller have reason to know of particular purpose for which goods are required and that buyer rely on seller's skill or judgment in selecting or furnishing suitable goods. Bruce v. Calhoun First Nat'l Bank, 134 Ga. App. 790, 216 S.E.2d 622 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to latent defects.</b> - Implied warranty is a guaranty against loss only from latent defects. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936); Smith v. Northeast Ga. Fair Ass'n, 85 Ga. App. 32, 67 S.E.2d 836 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Law of implied warranty will not avail against patent defects, nor against latent defects which are either disclosed or are discoverable by exercise of caution on part of purchaser. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936); Wilkinson v. Rich's, Inc., 77 Ga. App. 239, 48 S.E.2d 552 (1948); Smith v. Northeast Ga. Fair Ass'n, 85 Ga. App. 32, 67 S.E.2d 836 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While plaintiff's argument that no warranty existed because a buyer inspected the blocks buying and used the buyer's own judgment in selecting purchases was relevant to an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, it was not applicable to the warranty of merchantability at issue. Willis Mining, Inc. v. Noggle, 235 Ga. App. 747, 509 S.E.2d 731 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Waiver of warranty.</b> - Purchaser's acceptance of property bought with full knowledge of its defective condition constitutes waiver of implied warranty that property is in merchantable condition and suited for the purpose intended.

<p class="p4">Where property is brought under implied warranty that it is reasonably suited to use intended, an acceptance by purchaser waives all defects discovered by the purchaser, or which, by the exercise of ordinary care and prudence, the purchaser might have discovered before delivery. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936); Wilkinson v. Rich's, Inc., 77 Ga. App. 239, 48 S.E.2d 552 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranties inapplicable to settlement agreement.</b> - Seller sued a buyer who rejected the seller's goods; the parties settled. As the parties' agreement was a contract to settle litigation, with any sale of goods merely incidental, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-314 and 11-2-315, did not apply to their settlement agreement. Ole Mexican Foods, Inc. v. Hanson Staple Co., 285 Ga. 288, 676 S.E.2d 169 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Medical center's furnishing of facility for use in connection with surgery</b> to install a plate device to stabilize plaintiff's spine was a transaction involving "services and labor with an incidental furnishing of equipment and materials" and, as such, the Uniform Commercial Code had no application.

<p class="p4"><b>Pharmaceutical products.</b> - Patient who died after taking medicine which a pharmaceutical manufacturer gave to the doctor and which the doctor gave to the patient was not entitled to an extension of any implied warranty existing between the manufacturer and the doctor, and the appellate court upheld the trial court's judgment dismissing claims the patient's spouse filed against the manufacturer, alleging breach of express and implied warranties, but reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the husband's claims against the manufacturer alleging strict liability and negligent failure to warn.

<p class="p4"><b>Scented oil burner.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a seller's motion for summary judgment in a customer's action seeking to recover damages for injuries the customer sustained when the customer was burned from a ceramic, scented-oil burner and alleging, among other things, that the seller breached the seller's duty of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose because there was no evidence that the seller's employees knew that the customer intended to use the product in any way other than its ordinary purpose, burning scented oil; the customer utilized the ceramic burner for the ordinary purpose for which the item was intended, i.e., using the receptacle on the item to hold scented oil over a burning candle, causing the scent to diffuse throughout the customer's home.

<p class="p4"><b>Pallets.</b> - It was undisputed that the defendant knew the plaintiff would be using the heat-treated pallets to ship products overseas and it was similarly undisputed that plaintiff specifically requested certain heat-treated pallets and that the pallets supplied by the defendant met these specifications; however, it was also undisputed that the plaintiff did not specify any particular moisture content for the pallets the plaintiff ordered. There was conflicting evidence in the record as to whether the plaintiff requested green or raw wood or whether the defendant decided unilaterally to use green wood; accordingly, as there was a question of fact as to whether the plaintiff relied on the defendant's skill and judgment to supply it with pallets with appropriate moisture content for shipping products overseas in freight containers and whether the defendant failed to do so, summary judgment was inappropriate on the implied warranties claim.

<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-316(2) requires that, to exclude or modify an implied warranty of fitness, the actual warranty disclaimer language itself be conspicuous. That requirement is not satisfied if the disclaimer provision contains only general introductory language which is conspicuous. Leland Indus., Inc. v. Suntek Indus., Inc., 184 Ga. App. 635, 362 S.E.2d 441 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Warranty disclaimer language was "conspicuous" where it appeared in capital letters, in a separate paragraph on the front of an invoice, and in a type style which was otherwise employed on the form only with regard to language relating to the limitation of remedies. Apex Supply Co. v. Benbow Indus., Inc., 189 Ga. App. 598, 376 S.E.2d 694 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although, by its terms, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-316(3)(a) does not explicitly require that the "other language" be conspicuous, it implicitly imposes such a requirement.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranty of merchantability runs only to buyer.</b> - Implied warranty that goods are merchantable clearly arises out of contract of sale of goods, so it can only run to buyer who is in privity of contract with seller. Chaffin v. Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 127 Ga. App. 619, 194 S.E.2d 513 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Statement of mileage.</b> - It is an illogical extension to include within the concept of warranty of merchantability or fitness for purposes intended a statement of mileage required by an unrelated statute absent any showing that the statement of mileage is incorrect and/or connected to the injuries suffered. Troutt v. Nash AMC/Jeep, Inc., 157 Ga. App. 399, 278 S.E.2d 54 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exclusion by course of conduct.</b> - Implied warranty provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) did not apply to a settlement between a supplier and a customer because the primary purpose of the settlement was not a sale of goods, but was to resolve a dispute about whether the customer was obligated to purchase any goods and whether the goods were merchantable. Alternatively, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-316(3)(c), the parties had excluded the UCC's implied warranties based upon the parties course of conduct. Hanson Staple Co. v.

<p class="p4"><b>Jury decides factual question of modification or exclusion of warranty.</b> - Where the trial court specifically instructed the jury that "an implied warranty can be excluded or modified by course of dealings or course of performance or usage of trade," the evidence of such, sufficient to create an exception to the rule requiring conspicuous written exclusion of warranties, were questions of fact for the jury to determine.

<p class="p4"><b>Disclaimer of implied warranty was adequate.</b> - Where the disclaimer was in letters larger than any other type on the form, where significant portions of the disclaimer were capitalized, thus distinguishing them from other language on the form, and where the language was conspicuously set forth, the limitation of the implied warranty of merchantability met the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-316(2).

<p class="p4">Roofing material vendor's disclaimer of warranty, which stated in capitalized letters that the vendor made no warranties, express or implied, including merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, except as expressly stated therein, was sufficient to preclude an action against the vendor for breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.

There must in addition be demand by seller that buyer examine goods fully, which demand puts buyer on notice that the buyer is assuming risk of defects which examination ought to reveal.

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">Each provision of this article with regard to the rights, obligations, and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers, or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11">(1) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (Code Section 11-2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this title. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the article on secured transactions (Article 9 of this title), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his or her performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(a) If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him or her to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b) If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(a) If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he or she delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b) If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When title passes.</b> - If contract requires or authorizes seller to send goods to buyer but does not require seller to deliver them at destination, title passes to buyer at the time and place of shipment, but if contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there. Promech Corp. v. Brodhead-Garrett Co., 131 Ga. App. 314, 205 S.E.2d 511 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with other law.</b> - After obtaining consent from the probate court to sell construction equipment an executrix's decedent secured with a promissory note, the executrix was entitled to summary judgment as to the tort claims alleged against the decedent's corporation, after the corporation wrongfully retained possession of said equipment, converted two certificates of deposit, and the decedent's liability on the notes was extinguished under a provision of a stock sales agreement; furthermore, evidence was presented that the corporation's failure to release the equipment prevented its sale to third parties and thereby constituted a breach of a duty to mitigate damages. Midway R.R. Constr. Co. v. Beck, 281 Ga. App. 412, 636 S.E.2d 110 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Title did not pass to the shipper's customer upon delivery of goods to the carrier</b> where it was agreed between all parties that the seller bore the expense, not of putting the goods in possession of the carrier, but rather of transporting the goods to the place of destination. Clark v. Messer Indus., Inc., 222 Ga. App. 606, 475 S.E.2d 653 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery, in exchange for promise to pay in future, without retained security interest.</b> - Where defendant offered to pay in future for goods to be delivered presently, and seller agreed, delivered merchandise to defendant, and did not retain any security interest therein, there was a completed "sale" of the goods in question, and defendant had not only rightful possession of items, but title to them as well. Elliott v. State, 149 Ga. App. 579, 254 S.E.2d 900 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attempted reservation of title amounted to a security interest.</b> - When the peanut growers completed the performance of the growers' duties under the growers' contracts with a peanut broker by delivering the growers' peanuts to a peanut company, title passed to the broker. The growers' attempted reservation of title amounted to a security interest. Farm Credit of Northwest Fla., ACA v. Easom Peanut Co., 312 Ga. App. 374, 718 S.E.2d 590 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0444, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 315 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Customer's selection of goods and placing in shopping cart.</b> - Where defendant owner of barbecue restaurant continued to purchase large quantities of cut meat from plaintiff market's meat case (thereby leaving the market's meat case empty for other customers) instead of special ordering required meat as requested by plaintiff, plaintiff prevented defendant from paying for meat when defendant again disregarded plaintiff's instructions, and defendant refused to leave the market premises without paying for the meat selected, title to the meat did not pass to the defendant at the time defendant selected it and placed it in defendant's cart so as to serve as a basis for allowing defendant to ignore plaintiff's demand that defendant leave, thereby violating a criminal statute (criminal trespass). Watson v. State, 190 Ga. App. 671, 379 S.E.2d 811 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery of automobile.</b> - Where seller delivered possession of automobile to buyer and transaction was complete as between them even though compliance had not yet been made with recording and insurance statutes, buyer was "owner" of the automobile and buyer alone was liable to third party for injuries sustained in accident while buyer was driving automobile. American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co., 149 Ga. App. 280, 253 S.E.2d 825 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The evidence authorized the finding by the fact finder that, pursuant to the parties' understanding, the title to a motor vehicle passed to the buyer at the time the buyer received physical possession, with the seller holding the certificate as security only for the final payment of $50.00, which document was to be delivered at such time and place as the indebtedness was paid, and that, consequently, the sale was complete and the seller's uninsured motorist coverage on the vehicle was no longer in effect. Stone v. Nolan, 171 Ga. App. 644, 320 S.E.2d 781 (1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since there was no explicit agreement to the contrary, a used car dealer acquired title to a car and the right to sell the car to a third party when the car was delivered to the dealer for this purpose; the fact that the dealer did not obtain the certificate of title did not deprive the dealer of title in the car or prevent it from transferring title. Right Touch of Class, Inc. v. Superior Bank, FSB, 244 Ga. App. 473, 536 S.E.2d 181 (2000); Mitchell Motors, Inc. v. Barnett, 249 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Issues of fact for trial court.</b> - Issues such as whether an effective revocation of acceptance was made, whether reasonable notification of revocation was given to the seller, and whether the value of the goods was substantially impaired are ordinarily matters for determination by the trier of fact, even where the buyer has continued to use nonconforming goods after an alleged revocation of acceptance.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the issues dealt with, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-305 are included in the annotations for this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4">Manufacturer's express warranty on a vehicle was not governed by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, specifically 15 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 2304, but was governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-508, 11-2-605, and 11-2-607(3)(a) as the warranty was a limited warranty. Knight v. Am. Suzuki Motor Corp., 272 Ga. App. 319, 612 S.E.2d 546 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§§</b></span><b> 11-2-607 and 11-2-717 apply only to sales of goods.</b> Fruin-Colnon Corp. v. Air Door, Inc., 157 Ga. App. 804, 278 S.E.2d 708 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evaluation of buyer's conduct as a whole.</b> - A buyer's conduct must be evaluated as a whole under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-607, which is designed to defeat commercial bad faith. Clow Corp. v. Metro Pipeline Co., 442 F. Supp. 583 (N.D. Ga. 1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Installation by buyer of heavy equipment supplied by seller</b> is an act inconsistent with seller's ownership. United States ex rel. Fram Corp. v. Crawford, 443 F.2d 611 (5th Cir. 1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of acceptance of goods.</b> - Where property is brought under implied warranty that it is reasonably suited to use intended, acceptance by purchaser waives all defects discovered by the purchaser, or which, by exercise of ordinary care and prudence, might have discovered before delivery. Jones v. Knightstown Body Co., 52 Ga. App. 667, 184 S.E. 427 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-305). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where purchaser accepted and installed goods which were delivered late, subsequent attempts to revoke the purchase agreement were not effective. Management Assistance, Inc. v. Computer Dimensions, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 666 (N.D. Ga. 1982), aff'd sub nom. Computer Dimensions v. Basic Four, 747 F.2d 708 (11th Cir. 1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in awarding a seller pre-judgment interest under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 7-4-16 in the seller's breach of contract action against a buyer to recover damages for unpaid principal on shipped material and unpurchased material because the seller's invoices were a due and payable liquidated debt on a commercial account subject to interest under <span class="s1">§</span> 7-4-16; because certain materials were delivered by the seller and accepted by the buyer, the buyer was responsible for payment according to the agreed-upon price. Scovill Fasteners, Inc. v. Northern Metals, Inc., 303 Ga. App. 246, 692 S.E.2d 840 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance does not foreclose suit for breach.</b> - Absent an explicit contract term so providing, even explicit acceptance does not foreclose buyer's suit for breach of warranty. International Multifoods Corp. v. Nat'l Egg Prods., 202 Ga. App. 263, 414 S.E.2d 253 (1991), cert. denied, 202 Ga. App. 906, 414 S.E.2d 253 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reacceptance of goods.</b> - A buyer who has attempted to reject rather than to accept goods may nonetheless accept them by virtue of buyer's post-rejection conduct with respect to them. Likewise, a buyer who purports to revoke acceptance of goods may be found to have reaccepted them if, after such revocation, buyer performs acts which are inconsistent with the seller's ownership of the goods. Griffith v. Stovall Tire &amp; Marine, Inc., 174 Ga. App. 137, 329 S.E.2d 234 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A buyer reaccepted a motor vehicle after purported revocation of acceptance, even though the buyer gave sufficient notice that buyer revoked acceptance of the vehicle, when the buyer refused the seller access to it, persisted in efforts to have the vehicle repaired by entities other than the seller, and continued to possess and use the vehicle, which had been driven over 120,000 miles. Griffith v. Stovall Tire &amp; Marine, Inc., 174 Ga. App. 137, 329 S.E.2d 234 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of showing breach of express warranty.</b> - After acceptance of personal property sold under express warranty, it is presumed that it is of the quality ordered, and burden is upon buyer in all cases to show that it was not. Frick Co. v. Lawson, 50 Ga. App. 511, 179 S.E. 274 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-305). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Manufacturer did not breach its express warranty as the manufacturer addressed each defect in a vehicle as it arose, most repairs were made within days, and the only extended delay was the result of the buyer's decision to postpone bringing the vehicle into the repair facility. Knight v. Am. Suzuki Motor Corp., 272 Ga. App. 319, 612 S.E.2d 546 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Questions of fact.</b> - Reasonableness of notice by buyer of defect and responsibility for defect are questions of fact. Fruin-Colnon Corp. v. Air Door, Inc., 157 Ga. App. 804, 278 S.E.2d 708 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Issues such as whether an effective revocation of acceptance was made, whether reasonable notification of revocation was given to the seller, and whether the value of the goods was substantially impaired are ordinarily matters for determination by the trier of fact, even where the buyer has continued to use nonconforming goods after an alleged revocation of acceptance. Griffith v. Stovall Tire &amp; Marine, Inc., 174 Ga. App. 137, 329 S.E.2d 234 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Oral notification.</b> - Evidence that the buyer had complained about the quality of merchandise received and that the buyer told personnel of the seller that goods were defective, often immediately after inspecting the goods, presented an issue of material fact as to whether there was oral notification of defective accepted merchandise. Atwood v. Southeast Bedding Co., 226 Ga. App. 50, 485 S.E.2d 217 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to third-party beneficiary.</b> - Notice provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-607 of a breach cannot apply to third-party beneficiary under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-318 where there has been no tender of goods by seller and no acceptance from seller by such third party. Chaffin v. Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 127 Ga. App. 619, 194 S.E.2d 513 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The notice requirement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-607 applies only to the buyer and not to a third-party beneficiary. Morgan v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 693 F. Supp. 1154 (N.D. Ga. 1988); Morgan v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 700 F. Supp. 1574 (N.D. Ga. 1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicable to breach of warranty of title.</b> - The notice of breach required in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-607(3)(a)applies in cases of breach of warranty of title. Oden &amp; Sims Used Cars, Inc. v. Thurman, 165 Ga. App. 500, 301 S.E.2d 673 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adequate notice may be dissipated by subsequent actions of buyer.</b> - A buyer's dealings must be evaluated under standard of commercial good faith, and while adequate notice might be given at one point in time, subsequent actions by the buyer might dissipate its effect. Clow Corp. v. Metro Pipeline Co., 442 F. Supp. 583 (N.D. Ga. 1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that defendant has actual notice of breach</b> does not waive or alleviate the requirement that plaintiff give notice of any breach within a reasonable time or otherwise be barred from any remedy for the breach. Oden &amp; Sims Used Cars, Inc. v. Thurman, 165 Ga. App. 500, 301 S.E.2d 673 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to give notice.</b> - When plaintiff buyers of distributorship opportunities sued defendants, the seller and the seller's principal and relatives and other corporate entities, alleging all of the products shipped to the buyers were defective, the warranty claims failed because there was no proof that notice of the defects were given. Brenner v. Future Graphics, LLC, 258 F.R.D. 561 (N.D. Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>2. Time</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Receipt and acceptance of goods required.</b> - Notice of breach under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-607 cannot be given until receipt and acceptance of goods. Warren's Kiddie Shoppe, Inc. v. Casual Slacks, Inc., 120 Ga. App. 578, 171 S.E.2d 643 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adequacy of notice.</b> - No formality is required as to notice, and it is adequate if it merely informs seller within a reasonable time after goods are received and accepted by buyer. Holiday Homes, Inc. v. Bragg, 132 Ga. App. 594, 208 S.E.2d 608 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to notify seller within reasonable time is a bar against recovery</b> for all damages including any breaches of warranties which were caused by a difference in any characteristics or by any other apparent or obvious qualities of the goods. Economy Forms Corp. v. Kandy, Inc., 391 F. Supp. 944 (N.D. Ga. 1974), aff'd, 511 F.2d 1400 (5th Cir. 1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action alleging breach of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, the customer's failure to serve the seller with notice of the defect in the product until two years and three days after the customer suffered an injury did not bar relief; the delay alone, without prejudice to the seller caused by such delay, was insufficient to bar relief. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Wheeler, 262 Ga. App. 607, 586 S.E.2d 83 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Seller of trailers was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on a buyer's breach of contract claim; the buyer accepted delivery of the trailers pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-606(c) as the buyer acted inconsistently with the seller's ownership by undertaking to resell the trailers, and the buyer failed to timely notify the seller of any alleged breach as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-607(3)(a).

Feb. 1, 2011)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasonable time for notification for retail consumer.</b> - Time of notification required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-607(3)(a) is to be determined by applying commercial standards to merchant buyer. Consequently, "a reasonable time" for notification from retail consumer is to be judged by different standards so that in this case it will be extended, since rule of requiring notification is designed to defeat commercial bad faith, not to deprive a good faith consumer of remedy. Jones v. Cranman's Sporting Goods, 142 Ga. App. 838, 237 S.E.2d 402 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Notice after relationship terminated and goods retrieved by seller.</b> - Written notice that goods were unacceptable sent only after the relationship had been terminated and all goods had been either sold or retrieved by the seller was not sufficient.

<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment.</b> - The question of reasonableness of notice is ordinarily a factual one, although summary adjudication is appropriate if the uncontroverted facts establish that a plaintiff is not entitled to recover. International Multifoods Corp. v. Nat'l Egg Prods., 202 Ga. App. 263, 414 S.E.2d 253 (1991), cert. denied, 202 Ga. App. 906, 414 S.E.2d 253 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Whether purchaser acted unreasonably in not notifying seller, a defunct company, that it was dissatisfied that seller would not be providing the support services allegedly agreed upon was properly a question for the jury, and summary judgment on the basis of lack of notice was improperly granted to the seller.

<p class="p4"><b>Authority to revoke acceptance in certain circumstances.</b> - Buyer who has accepted goods may under certain conditions enumerated in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-608 revoke acceptance. Clow Corp. v. Metro Pipeline Co., 442 F. Supp. 583 (N.D. Ga. 1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-608 gives buyer right to revoke acceptance within reasonable time for nonconformity not within purchaser's knowledge at time of acceptance if such nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the buyer. Jacobs v. Metro Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 125 Ga. App. 462, 188 S.E.2d 250 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even after acceptance, the buyer has a right to revoke acceptance under the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-608 for nonconformance that substantially impairs the value of the goods. Prudential Metal Supply Corp. v. Atlantic Freight Sales Co., 204 Ga. App. 439, 419 S.E.2d 520 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-2-608(1)(b) refers to situations where nonconformity was discovered after acceptance.</b> Trailmobile Div. of Pullman, Inc. v. Jones, 118 Ga. App. 472, 164 S.E.2d 346 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No revocation after acceptance and installation.</b> - Once buyer has accepted and installed supplied units, any subsequent attempt at revocation is ineffective.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Continued use is inconsistent with a revocation of acceptance.</b> See Jenkins v. GMC, 240 Ga. App. 636, 524 S.E.2d 324 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the purchaser of an automobile continued to drive the vehicle, pay taxes on it, and insure it after the purchaser complained of defects, these post-revocation acts constituted exercises in ownership by the purchaser that were inconsistent with the seller's ownership; the buyer's attempted revocation was ineffective under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-606(1)(c) and 11-2-608(1)(b). Hines v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 358 F. Supp. 2d 1222 (N.D. Ga. 2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a consumer's suit against a car dealer for revocation of acceptance, regarding the sale of a used car which the dealer's salesman falsely represented had not been in a wreck, it was not error for the trial court to grant a directed verdict to the dealer because, while there was evidence that the consumer attempted to revoke the acceptance and the dealer refused, the consumer subsequently acted inconsistently with the dealer's ownership by continuing to possess the car and by installing a sunroof in it. Mitchell v. Backus Cadillac-Pontiac, Inc., 274 Ga. App. 330, 618 S.E.2d 87 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a consumer sued a car dealer for revocation of acceptance concerning the car she bought from it, the consumer's continued use of the car and continued making payments on it were inconsistent with the dealer's ownership of the car and defeated the revocation of acceptance claim, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-608(1).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation required privity of contract and could only be asserted against seller.</b> - Summary judgment on an automobile purchaser's revocation claim was appropriate because revocation of a sale requires privity of contract and thus can be asserted only against a seller, but the purchaser was suing the automobile distributor, not the dealership which sold the purchaser the car. Fedrick v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 366 F. Supp. 2d 1190 (N.D. Ga. 2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reacceptance of goods.</b> - Buyer who has attempted to reject rather than to accept goods may nonetheless accept them by virtue of the buyer's post-rejection conduct with respect to them. Likewise, a buyer who purports to revoke acceptance of goods may be found to have reaccepted them if, after such revocation, the buyer performs acts which are inconsistent with the seller's ownership of the goods. Griffith v. Stovall Tire &amp; Marine, Inc., 174 Ga. App. 137, 329 S.E.2d 234 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A buyer reaccepted a motor vehicle after purported revocation of acceptance, even though the buyer gave sufficient notice that the buyer revoked acceptance of the vehicle, when the buyer refused the seller access to it, persisted in efforts to have the vehicle repaired by entities other than the seller, and continued to possess and use the vehicle, which had been driven over 120,000 miles. Griffith v. Stovall Tire &amp; Marine, Inc., 174 Ga. App. 137, 329 S.E.2d 234 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Buyer, who purported to revoke acceptance of goods, could be found to have re-accepted them if, after such revocation, the buyer performed acts which were inconsistent with the seller's ownership of the goods. Olson v. Ford Motor Co., 258 Ga. App. 848, 575 S.E.2d 743 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Buyers revoked their acceptance of a motor home based on failure to repair alleged defects; the buyers' continued and extensive use of the luxury motor home for traveling to exotic places was not shown to be necessary, was inconsistent with revocation, and instead indicated reacceptance of the motor home. Gill v. Blue Bird Wanderlodge,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(M.D. Ga. Feb. 24, 2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of a dealership and a lender in a purchaser's action to recover damages for the dealership's failure to accept the purchaser's attempted revocation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-608 of an automobile purchase because the dealership and lender argued that the purchaser reaccepted the car since the purchaser continued driving the car after sending the revocation letter, and questions of fact existed about whether the purchaser's revocation was timely, whether the purchaser reaccepted the car after the tender, and whether the alleged defects substantially impaired the car's value to the purchaser; whether the purchaser's revocation was timely, whether the purchaser reaccepted the car, and whether the alleged defects substantially impaired the car's value to the purchaser were questions of fact for the jury. Mauk v. Pioneer Ford Mercury, 308 Ga. App. 864, 709 S.E.2d 353 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach of warranty to replace defective parts.</b> - Where in standard form new car warranty manufacturer and dealer expressly disclaim all warranties except that "any part of this vehicle found defective under this warranty will be repaired or replaced," the Uniform Commercial Code requires that a defect first be called to the attention of entities designated in the warranty, but does not prevent revocation of acceptance of vehicle by buyer after seller refuses to repair or replace defective parts. Jacobs v. Metro Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 125 Ga. App. 462, 188 S.E.2d 250 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of acceptance of peanuts, after blanching.</b> - The act of blanching peanuts, perfected by raising the temperature to a certain degree, thus causing the outer red hulls to fall off, constituted an acceptance of the goods pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-606(1)(c), as an "act inconsistent with the seller's ownership," but the blanching process did not substantially change the peanuts, so the buyer's revocation of acceptance of the peanuts, after the blanching process, was effective. Alimenta (U.S.A.), Inc. v. Anheuser-Busch Cos., 803 F.2d 1160 (11th Cir. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Seller's knowledge of problem and adjustment to account.</b> - Revocation of a contractor's acceptance of equipment could be found where there was evidence that the supplier was well aware of the problems with the equipment and made an adjustment to the contractor's account that the contractor did not find to be adequate. Williams v. Crispaire Corp., 225 Ga. App. 172, 483 S.E.2d 653 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Issues of fact.</b> - Issues such as whether an effective revocation of acceptance was made, whether reasonable notification of revocation was given to the seller, and whether the value of the goods was substantially impaired are ordinarily matters for determination by the trier of fact, even where the buyer has continued to use nonconforming goods after an alleged revocation of acceptance. Griffith v. Stovall Tire &amp; Marine, Inc., 174 Ga. App. 137, 329 S.E.2d 234 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Question of substantial impairment sufficient to authorize revocation is for jury, as well as question of reasonable time allowed seller to comply with warranty provision of sales contract. Hub Motor Co. v. Zurawski, 157 Ga. App. 850, 278 S.E.2d 689 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Granting defendants a directed verdict on a truck buyer's revocation of acceptance claim under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-608 was error when the buyer testified that the truck had been in for repairs more than 30 times, that the buyer had tried to get a replacement or a refund, and that the buyer had continued to use the truck and to pay the note, taxes, and insurance on the truck because the buyer could not afford to buy another truck while attempting to resolve the problems with this one and because the buyer had no other means of transportation; although certain provisions in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-602 and 11-2-606 might support the unqualified proposition that continued use was inconsistent with a revocation of acceptance, issues such as whether there was effective revocation of acceptance were ordinarily jury matters, and expecting a buyer to discontinue use could be contrary to the UCC's rule of reasonableness. Franklin v. Augusta Dodge, Inc., 287 Ga. App. 818, 652 S.E.2d 862 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Factors considered in determining whether revocation made in reasonable time.</b> - In determining whether revocation was made within a reasonable time after the buyer discovered or should have discovered the nonconformity, it is proper to consider all the surrounding circumstances, including the nature of the defect, the sophistication of the buyer, and the difficulty of its discovery. Bicknell v. B &amp; S Enters., 160 Ga. App. 307, 287 S.E.2d 310 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attempted revocation too long after purchase.</b> - Trial court properly granted a car dealership summary judgment on the purchasers' revocation of acceptance claim because pretermitting whether the car at issue was nonconforming at the time the car was sold, the purchasers' own undisputed evidence showed that the purchasers saw paint defects immediately before purchasing the car, asked if the car had been in a collision and the sales person replied that the sales person was "not sure" on that point, and the record also showed that the purchasers attempted revocation came long after the purchasers put thousands of miles on the car. Paulk v. Thomasville Ford Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 317 Ga. App. 780, 732 S.E.2d 297 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly granted the seller summary judgment on the buyers' revocation of acceptance claim because the 13-month delay of revocation after a substantial change in the condition of the vehicle was unreasonable as a matter of law. Edel v. Southtowne Motors of Newnan II, Inc., 338 Ga. App. 376, 789 S.E.2d 224 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No revocation for car buyer who could not show defective at purchase.</b> - There was no remedy of revocation because proof that the car was defective when sold was an essential element of the buyer's claim, which the buyer did not satisfy; the evidence showed that the buyer drove the used car approximately 26,000 miles before the cooling system began to malfunction.

<p class="p4"><b>Section requires proof of commercial impracticability of performance.</b> - The Uniform Commercial Code does not require proof of impossibility of performance but merely that of impracticability, which term must be interpreted as commercial impracticability. To that extent the Uniform Commercial Code makes contract less binding on parties by widening grounds for which a seller may be relieved of the seller's obligation. Swift Textiles, Inc. v.

<p class="p4"><b>Section not applicable to noncommercial goods sales contract.</b> - Trial court did not err in awarding summary judgment to the State Medical Education Board, making a student liable for both the amount of the scholarship received and attorney's fees, as: (1) estoppels were unfavored under Georgia law; (2) the student came forward with no more than hearsay to support a claim that oral misrepresentations of fact were made regarding said scholarship; (3) the contract was not rescinded by either party; (4) no mutual mistake of fact was found; and (5) any impossibility in performing the contract was personal to the student.

<p class="p4"><b>Affirmative provision in contract required.</b> - For there to be exception to and exemption from rule of allocation applicable to contract of sale, such contract must contain affirmative provision that seller will perform contract even though contingencies which permit allocation might occur.

<p class="p4"><b>Agreement to pay damages if event making performance impossible occurs.</b> - An affirmative provision in contract that seller agrees to pay stipulated damages upon occurrence of an event making performance impossible necessarily implies that a breach of contract under those conditions is conceded, and places upon seller a greater obligation than might otherwise exist.

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-708 was intended to provide an adequate remedy for the "lost volume dealer" or "lost volume seller," which refers to a seller who, due to the nature of its business, is damaged by a buyer's breach to the extent that it loses the entire profit from the sale. Unique Designs, Inc. v. Pittard Mach. Co., 200 Ga. App. 647, 409 S.E.2d 241, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 897, 409 S.E.2d 241 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Arithmetical accuracy in determining damages not required.</b> - The evidence clearly established a breach of an agreement to buy/sell electronic circuit boards and a resulting right to damages even though the amount of damages was arrived at by use of a complex and confusing mathematical methodology which did not produce exact arithmetical accuracy.

<p class="p4"><b>Proof required to establish "lost volume dealer."</b> - In order for seller to establish that seller is a "lost volume dealer," seller must prove that even though the repudiated contract goods were later resold by the seller, the sale to the third party would have been made regardless of the buyer's breach so that the seller would have realized two profits from two sales.

<p class="p4"><b>Right to return purchase price.</b> - Upon cancellation, buyer is entitled under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-711(1), to return of purchase price. Jacobs v. Metro Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 125 Ga. App. 462, 188 S.E.2d 250 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election between revocation and damages for breach.</b> - A buyer is no longer required to elect between revocation and damages for breach, but this does not mean that the buyer cannot elect if the buyer so chooses.

<p class="p4">Cancellation is merely a remedy for the revoking buyer and not an unavoidable result of revocation. Poultry Health Serv. of Ga., Inc. v. Moxley, 538 F. Supp. 276 (S.D. Ga. 1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reacceptance of goods.</b> - A buyer who has attempted to reject rather than to accept goods may nonetheless accept them by virtue of buyer's post-rejection conduct with respect to them. Likewise, a buyer who purports to revoke acceptance of goods may be found to have reaccepted them if, after such revocation, the buyer performs acts which are inconsistent with the seller's ownership of the goods.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Issues of fact.</b> - Issues such as whether an effective revocation of acceptance was made, whether reasonable notification of revocation was given to the seller, and whether the value of the goods was substantially impaired are ordinarily matters for determination by the trier of fact, even where the buyer has continued to use nonconforming goods after an alleged revocation of acceptance.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proper elements of damages.</b> - An award representing market-price contract-price differential as well as consequential damages in form of lost resale profits simply combined in category "loss of profits" are proper elements of damages. Fratelli Gardino v. Caribbean Lumber Co., 447 F. Supp. 1337 (S.D. Ga. 1978), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, Fratelli Gardino v. Caribbean Lumber Co., 587 F.2d 204 (5th Cir. 1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages not speculative.</b> - In a suit brought by a buyer after an oral contract for the sale of a horse fell through, damages were not speculative; there was evidence that the seller had an offer of $50,000 for the horse on the same day that the seller agreed to sell the horse to the buyer for $35,000, and that the horse was eventually sold to another party for over $200,000. Rowland v. Scarborough Farms, LLC, 285 Ga. App. 831, 648 S.E.2d 151 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery of inferior product.</b> - Buyer of a custom machine presented sufficient evidence of the market price of a similar, though less desirable, machine, and evidence of expenses incurred due to the seller's failure to deliver the machine as ordered and was entitled to damages. Latex Equip. Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Apache Mills, Inc., 225 Ga. App. 516, 484 S.E.2d 274 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient proof of lost profits.</b> - Though a subcontractor successfully proved a breach of contract claim against a supplier, the damages award in the amount of $160,000 was reversed on appeal as the subcontractor failed to present any evidence of anticipated expenses due to the loss of a construction project arising from the breach, and therefore the subcontractor's proof of lost profits was insufficient as a matter of law and required a new trial; further, because the damages award was reversed, the appellate court also reversed the award of attorney fees to the subcontractor since the award of attorney fees was contingent upon the damages award on the breach of contract claim. Bldg. Materials Wholesale, Inc. v. Triad Drywall, LLC, 287 Ga. App. 772, 653 S.E.2d 115 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach of contract to sell vehicle.</b> - In an action arising from an alleged breach of a contract to sell a vehicle brought by a buyer against a car dealer, because a genuine issue of material fact remained over the amount of damages that should be awarded, as the evidence presented a dispute as to the market price of the vehicle at the time of the breach, and the dealer's owner gave conflicting deposition testimony regarding the value of the vehicle, summary judgment was unwarranted.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of section.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714 applies only where a buyer claims breach of contract regarding accepted goods; breaches based on grounds of rejection, revocation of acceptance, or rescission of agreement are not covered by that section.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Repurchase offer agreed to as part of agreement.</b> - Where it was determined that parties had agreed upon repurchase offer of seller in event of dissatisfaction of buyer as part of enforceable agreement, enforcement of such offer was reasonable measure of recovery under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714(1).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suit based on contract and warranty grounds.</b> - Buyers of an irrigation system who did not frame their suit or their proof merely on grounds of breach of warranty, but pleaded breach of contract as well, were therefore not restricted to the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714(2) as to proof of damages in cases of breach of warranty in commercial transactions.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between contract induced by fraud and breach of warranty.</b> - There is a distinction to be drawn between a contract induced by fraud and mere breach of warranty; in the former case title does not pass, and contract may be rescinded, and in the latter case title does pass, and purchaser is relegated to a claim for damages.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of defect and resulting damages is prerequisite to recovery.</b> - To recover in warranty, it is necessary that plaintiff show: (1) goods in question were defective upon delivery, and (2) such defect caused damage claimed. In cases of this type, proof of defective quality of goods is prerequisite to recovery. Multivision N.W., Inc. v. Jerrold Elecs. Corp., 356 F. Supp. 207 (N.D.

<p class="p4"><b>Proof as to value of warrantied vehicle and vehicle as delivered, is required.</b> - Motor home seller's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law was denied in part because buyers presented sufficient evidence to support their claim for damages arising out of company's breach of implied warranty; to establish their damage claims under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714(2); buyers established both the motor home's value as warranted and its value as delivered to them.

<p class="p4"><b>Goods confiscated as stolen property.</b> - Where plaintiff proved not only the price paid for two trucks and the lending bank's appraisal of value, but also that what plaintiff accepted were stolen trucks for which plaintiff owed an interest-bearing note to the bank, undifferentiated damages awarded as the foreseeable and logical consequence of the breach were authorized.

<p class="p4"><b>Counterclaim for breach of warranty and refusal to pay for nonconformity not redundant.</b> - In suit to recover on purchase order, the trial court errs in striking a counterclaim for breach of warranty because it is allegedly redundant in view of an affirmative defense of right to refuse payment because of nonconformity.

<p class="p4">Owners failed to present competent evidence of damages under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714(2) because an owner's affidavit lacked a proper foundation as the owner failed to testify that any of the past purchases included the purchase of a vehicle with the defects at issue, the owner did not have any specialized knowledge, and the owner's testimony was not supported by objective information on vehicles found in published valuation guides, such as the "Blue Book"; the value of the defective vehicle could not be established by the repair invoices as few, if any, of the repairs reflected costs incurred by the owners. Hill v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 274 Ga. App. 826, 619 S.E.2d 353 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a manufacturer did not admit a customer's prima facie case breach of warranty case under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714(2), the trial court erred in denying the manufacturer the right to open and close the final argument under Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Damages for breach of implied warranty of merchantability.</b> - For breach of seller's implied warranty of merchantability purchaser may recover: (a) reasonable expense of operating or attempting to operate the machine or equipment, provided none of the expense is incurred after discovery of fact that it could not be made to operate properly; (b) reasonable cost of making repairs or correcting defects if incurred by seller, or if, by reason of breach or defects the machine or equipment cannot be made to operate properly by making repairs or correcting defects; (c) difference between amount paid and value of the chattel; (d) loss of profits resulting from breach, if not speculative; and (e) any damage to person or property directly traceable to the breach. Taylor v. Wilson, 109 Ga. App. 658, 137 S.E.2d 353 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 96-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of damages.</b> - Because the buyers provided an insufficient foundation for a lay opinion concerning the diminished value of a vehicle under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714(2), the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the automobile manufacturer on the buyers' warranty claims.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Repair costs.</b> - While some cases hold that repair costs are a sufficient measure of damages, there are others holding the opposite view; the basic rule is that the measure of damages for breach of warranty is to be determined by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-714. Whether repair costs can satisfy the proof requirement depends entirely on the sufficiency and reliability of the evidence presented in the context of the individual case. Fried Group, Inc. v. Sundance Tractor &amp; Mower, 218 Bankr. 247 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under Fed. R. Evid. 701, the buyer of motor home could give lay testimony as to market value of motor home following repairs performed by the seller and the buyer's market value opinion was relevant because the seller conceded that the market for the type of motor home at issue was extremely individualized and the buyers represented half of the entire market for that type of motor home during the year that it was purchased; the sales contract was relevant evidence on the issue of damages because the purchase price of the motor home was evidence of its value as warranted.

<p class="p4"><b>Lost profits.</b> - Loss of profits from destruction or interruption of established business may be recovered if amount of actual loss is rendered reasonably certain by competent proof.

<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient proof of lost profits.</b> - Though a subcontractor successfully proved a breach of contract claim against a supplier, the damages award in the amount of $160,000 was reversed on appeal as the subcontractor failed to present any evidence of anticipated expenses due to the loss of a construction project arising from the breach, and therefore the subcontractor's proof of lost profits was insufficient as a matter of law and required a new trial; further, because the damages award was reversed, the appellate court also reversed the award of attorney fees to the subcontractor since the award of attorney fees was contingent upon the damages award on the breach of contract claim.

<p class="p4"><b>Distinguished from O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>9-3-24. - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725 applies to sales contracts, while O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-24 covers all other simple written contracts. Cleveland Lumber Co. v. Proctor &amp; Schwartz, Inc., 397 F. Supp. 1088 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sealed contract to purchase inventory.</b> - An action for breach of a written contract, under seal, to purchase the inventory of a retail business was governed by the four-year limitation period under the UCC and not by the 20 year limitation period applicable to actions on sealed instruments. McLean v. Gray, 180 Ga. App. 794, 350 S.E.2d 815 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Services incidental to sales contract.</b> - Where clauses in contract which may amount to services are merely incidental to main purpose of contract and do not take it out of sales provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, its statute of limitations appears to apply rather than the general Georgia statute of limitations on contracts. Cleveland Lumber Co. v. Proctor &amp; Schwartz, Inc., 397 F. Supp. 1088 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Mixed contract for sale of goods and services.</b> - When the predominant element of a contract is the sale of goods, the contract is viewed as a sales contract and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725 is the applicable statute of limitations even though a substantial amount of service is to be rendered in installing the goods. When the predominant element of a contract is the furnishing of services, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-24 applies. Factors to be considered in determining the predominant element include the proportion of the total contract cost allocated to the goods and whether the price of the goods are segregated from the price for services.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach warranty to repair or replace.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725, while a breach of warranty generally occurs upon delivery of goods regardless of time of discovery of breach, where there is an agreement to repair or replace, warranty is not breached until there is refusal or failure to repair. Space Leasing Assocs. v. Atlantic Bldg. Sys., 144 Ga. App. 320, 241 S.E.2d 438 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a warranty included an agreement to replace or repair, the trial court correctly ruled that defendant breached its warranty when it refused to conduct further warranty repairs and that the complaint was filed well within the limitation period which did not commence running until the breach. Versico, Inc. v. Engineered Fabrics Corp., 238 Ga. App. 837, 520 S.E.2d 505 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Breach by supplier.</b> - For purpose of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725, breach of contract by subcontractor who supplied glass and labor for construction of overhead bridge occurred at time glass was installed and accepted by owner.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Whether action is barred by lapse of time.</b> - If sole question is one as to length of time which has elapsed between accrual of right and institution of action, question as to whether action is barred is one of law. Cleveland Lumber Co. v. Proctor &amp; Schwartz, Inc., 397 F. Supp. 1088 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Case involving fraud and excuse for delayed discovery.</b> - Where facts indicate fraud and excuses for delay in its discovery, question is one of mixed law and fact, and is a proper question for determination by jury under proper instructions from the court. Cleveland Lumber Co. v. Proctor &amp; Schwartz, Inc., 397 F. Supp. 1088 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Service of process beyond statute of limitation period.</b> - Trial court erred in granting a creditor summary judgment in the creditor's action against a guarantor to collect on a past due commercial account because the guarantor was served several years beyond either the two-year statute of limitation period, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725, or the four-year limitation period, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-25; the creditor had notice of a service of process issue at least as early as March 2007 and knew of the service problem in January 2008, but the creditor did not serve the guarantor with process until September 2008, and the creditor failed to prove that the creditor exercised due diligence in attempting to effect service. Scanlan v. Tate Supply Co., 303 Ga. App. 9, 692 S.E.2d 684 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement not governed by O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>9-3-24. - The release agreement which by its terms superseded the lease and maintenance agreements, and provided for the mutual release of all claims arising out of the prior agreements was a contract for sale of the offspring of the leased cattle, and the action was barred by the four-year limitation period of the sales article, rather than the six-year limitation period for written contracts under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-24. Embryo Progeny Assocs. v. Lovana Farms, Inc., 203 Ga. App. 447, 416 S.E.2d 833, cert. denied, 203 Ga. App. 906, 416 S.E.2d 833 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract was sale of goods and barred by statute of limitations.</b> - Grant of summary judgment in favor of a bank was properly reversed because the predominant purpose of the contract was the sale of a good; thus, the four year statute of limitation in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725(1) applied and the bank's deficiency claim was barred since the claim was filed more than four years after the cause of action accrued. SunTrust Bank v. Venable, 299 Ga. 655, 791 S.E.2d 5 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Secured transactions.</b> - While it appeared that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-24, rather than O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725, would most likely apply to defendant collection attorney's state court deficiency action against plaintiff consumer, and it was not for the federal court to say what the Georgia courts would hold, the uncertainty meant there was no intentional unfair conduct and the consumer's Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claim was dismissed. Almand v. Reynolds &amp; Robin, P.C., 485 F. Supp. 2d 1361 (M.D. Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because an oral contract concerning the disposal of car skeletons on property operated as a junkyard did not violate the O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-2-201 and 11-2-725, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against a seller on his counterclaim for fraud, due to the option holder's repudiation of the contract in filing for specific performance. Henry v. Blankenship, 284 Ga. App. 578, 644 S.E.2d 419 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claims based on invoices.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of a debtor on all of the invoices that made up a creditor's claim against the debtor on the ground that the complaint was barred by the four-year limitation period for a suit on account because the trial court's grant of summary judgment was based on a purported admission by the creditor that the creditor's claims accrued on April 3, 2001, but the trial court misread the document, and the creditor submitted authenticated invoices, which showed dates more recent than four years prior to the date suit was filed; unless otherwise provided in the agreement, claims are barred if the claims are asserted more than four years after invoices are submitted to the buyer.

<p class="p4"><b>Implied warranty.</b> - Plaintiffs' implied warranty claims against a vehicle manufacturer and a distributor were barred by the four-year statute of limitations in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-725(1) as the plaintiffs' claims accrued when the plaintiffs' vehicles were first sold.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - Intent of this section is that a negotiable instrument carry nothing but simple promise to pay, with certain limited exceptions, and provision in a writing granting to holder powers to waive particular defaults or remedies without waiving others and to require its written consent for any transfer of buyer's obligations, while keeping its own freely transferrable, is not among these exceptions. Geiger Fin. Co. v. Graham, 123 Ga. App. 771, 182 S.E.2d 521 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Recitation of consideration in promissory note is not essential to recovery.</b> Riddick v. Evans, 155 Ga. App. 868, 274 S.E.2d 40 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer from bank to holding company required party substitution.</b> - Bank effectively transferred the bank's interest in the promissory notes, deeds to secure debt, guaranties, and other accompanying documents to the holding company so that, whether the holding company was a holder in due course or not, the holding company was the real party in interest here and the trial court properly granted the motion to substitute the party.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Instrument with no unconditional promise to pay sum at determinable future date.</b> - Where the instrument at issue was not a negotiable note and was expressly never to be enforced against the petitioner individually and personally, the instrument was not a promissory note or any other obligation of insured since it did not contain unconditional promise to pay anything at any determinable future date. American Cas. Co. v. Griffith, 107 Ga. App. 224, 129 S.E.2d 549 (1963) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Bailey v. Polote, 152 Ga. App. 255, 262 S.E.2d 551 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Defendant's filling out of a loan application with an internet lender for the purchase of a vehicle by falsely using the defendant's father's social security number, which caused the lender to issue a check that was used for the payment of the vehicle, provided sufficient evidence for a conviction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-8-3 even though the lender stopped payment prior to purchase; the document received by the defendant from the lender was a "check" within the definition of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-104(f)(1), as it referenced itself in that manner and was drawn on a bank.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Check backed by lawful money.</b> - Inherent in the definition, a check is a promise to pay which can be taken by the bearer or indorsee and "cashed" or converted on demand into federal reserve notes equalling the value stated on the check. Strickland v. A Mtg. Co., 179 Bankr. 979 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Place of performance.</b> - A check is a written contract to be performed at place where banking house or place of business of person on whom it is drawn is located. Mason v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Checks and demand notes.</b> - There is little difference between a check and a demand note. Both are acknowledgments of indebtedness and unconditional promises to pay. Mason v.

<p class="p4"><b>Blank payment checks were valueless.</b> - On cross-motions for summary judgment in a Fair Labor Standards Act case filed by plaintiff Mexican national agricultural laborers against defendant employers that included a claim for conversion of certain "reimbursement" checks in that the employers directed the laborers to endorse and return the checks, and the employers argued that it was entitled to the returned checks due to the employers paying for bus fares and subsistence and additional transportation expenses in cash, and also argued that the checks were blank, the court agreed with the employers that because the checks were blank, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-3-104(c) and 11-3-420(a), they were valueless, so there would be no damage from converting the checks.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It makes no difference if payee fills in amount due.</b> - A defendant could be found guilty of the issuance of bad checks despite defendant's contention that the checks were not "checks" because they did not contain a "sum certain" until the payee filled in the amount due at the defendant's request. Hutchens v. State, 174 Ga. App. 507, 330 S.E.2d 436 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absence of drawer's signature on payroll check.</b> - Fact that instrument purporting to be payroll check was not signed by drawer does not prevent it from being a check under this section, since it had most attributes of a check and was used in transaction as a check would ordinarily be used. United States v. Webb, 443 F.2d 308 (5th Cir. 1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conditional sale contract.</b> - Although theoretically possible, a retail installment contract, or conditional sale contract (or a writing of this nature by whatever name) is not usually a note as defined in this section, but where there is any doubt, presumption is against negotiability. Geiger Fin. Co. v. Graham, 123 Ga. App. 771, 182 S.E.2d 521 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Decatur Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 276 Ga. 817, 583 S.E.2d 6 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cashier's check properly paid to court.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank because the bank acted properly in refusing to honor the cashier's check since the funds were the property of the payee and were within the control of the bank at the time the bank received the garnishment order; thus, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-4 required that the bank pay those funds into the court in the garnishment action and not to the payee.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-403 and 14-412 and former Code Section 11-3-116 are included in the annotations for this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of former statute regarding scope of endorsement.</b> - Purpose of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-403, which required endorsement of the entire instrument or the unpaid residue, was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to prevent payee or payees from varying or enlarging contract initially made by maker of instrument. When a maker executed a negotiable instrument payable to one payee or more, jointly, the maker subjected to one lawsuit, and if the payee in instrument transferred it to two or more endorsees severally, such endorsement subjected maker to two or more suits to which the maker had not been liable at time executed instrument. Hodson v. Scoggins, 102 Ga. App. 44, 115 S.E.2d 715 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession as evidence of title.</b> - Possession of a negotiable instrument is presumptive evidence of title, but it is not conclusive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One in possession of personal property is presumed to be the owner until the contrary appears, and the burden of rebutting the presumption is upon the party claiming adversely to the one in possession. Hattaway v. Keefe, 191 Ga. App. 315, 381 S.E.2d 569 (1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ownership between copayees.</b> - This Code section does not control ownership between copayees. Hattaway v. Keefe, 191 Ga. App. 315, 381 S.E.2d 569 (1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enforcement by principal or agent in own name.</b> - Principal or agent may enforce payment as holder of instrument in own name. Bennett v. Cannon, 114 Ga. App. 479, 151 S.E.2d 828 (1966) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-117).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alternate Payees</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One endorsement where payees' names separated by slash.</b> - Bank's payment of checks with only one endorsement is not only proper but was required where the two designated payees' names are separated by a virgule. Ryland Group, Inc. v. Gwinnett County Bank, 151 Ga. App. 148, 259 S.E.2d 152 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Endorsement by all payees.</b> - Instrument payable to joint payees must be endorsed by all of them. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Atlas Supply Co., 121 Ga. App. 1, 172 S.E.2d 632 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Payment of a check payable to order of two or more payees without endorsement of a joint payee is exercise of dominion and control over check inconsistent with nonsigning payee's rights amounting to conversion. Situation is analogous to payment of check on forged endorsement, which former Code section <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-419(1)(c) acknowledges to be conversion. Trust Co. v. Refrigeration Supplies, Inc., 241 Ga. 406, 246 S.E.2d 282 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cashing bank's liability for failure to obtain copayee's endorsement.</b> - Cashing bank is liable in damages to copayee for its failure to obtain copayee's endorsement on checks involved. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Atlas Supply Co., 121 Ga. App. 1, 172 S.E.2d 632 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Damaged payee has cause of action against cashing bank for damages sustained where latter fails to obtain endorsements of all copayees on check. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Atlas Supply Co., 121 Ga. App. 1, 172 S.E.2d 632 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank not holder of instrument lacking joint payee's endorsement.</b> - A bank never became a holder in due course where a check made payable jointly to the bank's customer and a third party was never endorsed by the third party before deposit in the bank. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Sun Belt Elec. Constructors, Inc., 64 Bankr. 377 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-116).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where payee's interest in note is specified.</b> - Where instrument is payable to order of three payees and specifically states that interest of third payee is to be $1,000.00, endorsee of such third payee may maintain action for interest in the instrument without endorsement of other two payees and without joining them as parties. Hodson v. Scoggins, 102 Ga. App. 44, 115 S.E.2d 715 (1960)(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-412).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Where blank is left in bill or note for name of payee,</b> there is an implied authority to holder to fill up instrument and make it in fact what it was designed to be.

<p class="p4"><b>Liability of two or more makers to note.</b> - Under this section, whenever two or more persons sign as maker they are jointly and severally liable unless instrument in its own language specifies obligation differently, e.g., "we jointly promise" or "we promise severally." Ghitter v. Edge, 118 Ga. App. 750, 165 S.E.2d 598 (1968) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-118).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>"We promise to pay."</b> - A promissory note signed by two or more persons as makers, and containing the words, "I, we, or either of us promise to pay," imports joint and several liability of makers. This comports with this section. Powell v. Mobley, 166 Ga. 163, 142 S.E. 678 (1928) (decided under former Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>"Holder" transferee.</b> - Only a negotiation, not an assignment, can make a transferee a "holder" of a negotiable instrument. Bank of Danielsville v. Seagraves, 167 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intermediary in possession of note payable to order of another.</b> - Intermediary in possession of note payable to order of some other person, although the intermediary might have an equity therein, is incapable of negotiating it, even to payee designated by instrument. Davis v. National City Bank, 46 Ga. App. 194, 167 S.E. 191 (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Delivery</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Essential in case of order paper.</b> - Delivery is an essential element of negotiation in the case of order paper. Bank of Danielsville v. Seagraves, 167 Ga. App. 135, 305 S.E.2d 790 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Only bearer paper is negotiated by mere delivery.</b> - The only note which can be negotiated by mere delivery is one expressly made payable, or which has become payable, to bearer.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of constructive delivery.</b> - Where there is no actual delivery of order paper, constructive delivery may be sufficient to effect negotiation where there is delivery of a written assignment without delivery of the negotiable instrument and it is the clear intent of the parties to effect such delivery and to transfer title to the negotiable instrument. Bank of Danielsville v. Seagraves, 167 Ga. App. 135, 305 S.E.2d 790 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Endorsement Generally</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of former endorsement requirements.</b> - Purpose of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-403, requiring endorsement of the entire instrument or the residue, was to prevent payee or payees from varying or enlarging contract initially made by maker of instrument. When a maker executed a negotiable instrument payable to one payee or more, jointly, the maker was subjected to one lawsuit, and if the payee in instrument transferred it to two or more endorsees severally, such endorsement subjected maker to two or more suits to which the maker had not been liable at time executed instrument. Hodson v. Scoggins, 102 Ga. App. 44, 115 S.E.2d 715 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-403 and 14-412).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Idea of endorsement has no relevance while note remains in hands of payee.</b> - Idea of endorsement or negotiation is not only excluded while note remains in hands of payee, but such is equally true prior to time it reaches payee's hands by delivery. Davis v. National City Bank, 46 Ga. App. 194, 167 S.E. 191 (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-401). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where there are but two original parties to promissory note, maker and payee, so long as note remains in hands of payee, the idea of endorsement is excluded. Willoughby v. Newman, 46 Ga. App. 377, 167 S.E. 783 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Endorsement required to be holder in due course of order paper.</b> - To be holder in due course of note payable to named payee or order requires payee's endorsement. Fourth Nat'l Bank v. Lattimore, 168 Ga. 547, 148 S.E. 396 (1929) (decided under former Ga. L. 1924, p. 126, <span class="s1">§</span> 52). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Instrument payable to order can only be negotiated by endorsement. Roswell Bank v. Citizens &amp; S. De Kalb Bank, 104 Ga. App. 291, 121 S.E.2d 706 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer of order paper on consideration of love and affection.</b> - Legal title to note, payable to order, does not pass to transferee for consideration of love and affection only, except by endorsement on instrument or on paper attached to it. Moore v. Moore, 35 Ga. App. 39, 131 S.E. 922 (1926) (decided under former Ga. L. 1924, p. 126, <span class="s1">§</span> 31).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Endorsement in corporate name, without more.</b> - In suit by transferee of negotiable instrument, written endorsement thereon, bearing as signature only corporate name of payee, not accompanied by name of agent by whom affixed nor by corporate seal, is, nevertheless, sufficient proof of transfer, unless endorsement be specifically denied on oath. Sheffield v. Johnson County Sav. Bank, 2 Ga. App. 221, 58 S.E. 386 (1907) (decided under former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3705).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An endorsement alone never constitutes negotiation,</b> and an attempt to negotiate note payable to order by endorsement of holder is incomplete, so that if stopped there, without delivery, there is no negotiation and title remains in holder. Evans v. Luce, 190 Ga. 403, 9 S.E.2d 646 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A writing and signature is necessary to formal endorsement</b> of a negotiable instrument. Willoughby v. Newman, 46 Ga. App. 377, 167 S.E. 783 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery where payee's interest in note is specified.</b> - Where instrument is payable to order of three payees and it specifically states that interest of third payee is to be $1,000.00, endorsee of such third payee may maintain action for interest in the instrument without endorsement of other two payees and without joining them as parties. Hodson v. Scoggins, 102 Ga. App. 44, 115 S.E.2d 715 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-403 and 14-412).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer without endorsement.</b> - Where record shows that promissory note sued on was transferred for value by payee to plaintiff, but fails to show any endorsement, there was a transfer but no "negotiation" of instrument, and such transfer without endorsement does not preclude defendant from pleading, as against plaintiff transferee, any defenses which defendant could have set up against payee. Christie v. Bassford, 49 Ga. App. 94, 169 S.E. 687 (1933) (decided under former Ga. L. 1924, p. 126, <span class="s1">§</span> 49, subsequently codified as former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-420).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When attachment of endorsement allowed.</b> - A separate paper may be attached to bill or note for purpose of writing endorsements when there is no room on instrument itself. Tallahassee Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Raines, 125 Ga. App. 263, 187 S.E.2d 320 (1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extent to which paper must be affixed to instrument.</b> - To operate as an endorsement, a separate paper must be so firmly affixed to the instrument as to become an extension or part of it. Tallahassee Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Raines, 125 Ga. App. 263, 187 S.E.2d 320 (1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>A separate paper pinned or clipped to an instrument</b> is an insufficient endorsement. Tallahassee Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Raines, 125 Ga. App. 263, 187 S.E.2d 320 (1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Methods of transfer.</b> - There are two methods for transfer of negotiable instruments - negotiation and assignment. Bank of Danielsville v. Seagraves, 167 Ga. App. 135, 305 S.E.2d 790 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Holder" transferee.</b> - Only a negotiation, not an assignment, can make a transferee a "holder" of a negotiable instrument. Bank of Danielsville v. Seagraves, 167 Ga. App. 135, 305 S.E.2d 790 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery.</b> - Delivery is an essential element of negotiation in the case of order paper. Bank of Danielsville v. Seagraves, 167 Ga. App. 135, 305 S.E.2d 790 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of constructive delivery.</b> - Where there is no actual delivery of order paper, constructive delivery may be sufficient to effect negotiation where there is delivery of a written assignment without delivery of the negotiable instrument and it is the clear intent of the parties to effect such delivery and to transfer title to the negotiable instrument. Bank of Danielsville v. Seagraves, 167 Ga. App. 135, 305 S.E.2d 790 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery not a transfer.</b> - Issuer of the check was debtor and therefore delivery of the checks to the law firms was not a transfer for purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-203. In re Georgetown Square II LLC,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bankruptcy.</b> - Mere delivery of a check by the check's issuer to a payee of that check is not a transfer of an interest in property of the issuer other than as to the paper or other object on which the check was written because the delivery of the check, apart from any intrinsic value the check might have, does not reduce the issuer's net worth or give the holder of the check any claim on the property of the issuer other than the right to enforce the check. But if a check, whenever delivered, is honored when the issuer is a debtor in bankruptcy, the payment of the check is, in the parlance of 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 549, a "transfer of property of the estate."

<p class="p4"><b>Rights of transferee.</b> - Transferee acquires same rights as its transferor had. Northside Bldg. &amp; Inv. Co. v. Finance Co. of Am., 119 Ga. App. 131, 166 S.E.2d 608 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank as holder in due course.</b> - There is no compelling reason that a bank cannot be holder or holder in due course of instrument drawn on it if it meets all qualifications of the status, e.g., by taking instrument from transferor who is a holder in due course. FDIC v. West, 244 Ga. 396, 260 S.E.2d 89 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Repurchase by prior holder.</b> - A sale under a power does not technically come within former Code section <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-302(3)(a), but under this section prior holder with notice of defense or claim against instrument cannot improve position by repurchase. Northside Bldg. &amp; Inv. Co. v. Finance Co. of Am., 119 Ga. App. 131, 166 S.E.2d 608 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase at judicial sale.</b> - Status of one against whom defense might have been urged in prior capacity will not improve by interposing a holder in due course, but in the same vein one with rights of a holder in due course, and who has not otherwise lost such rights, does not diminish status by purchasing at a judicial sale although that person may not by virtue of such purchase alone become a due course holder. Finance Co. of Am. v. Wilson, 115 Ga. App. 280, 154 S.E.2d 459 (1967) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">To sustain action on promissory note payable to order of third party it must be affirmatively shown that note has been transferred to plaintiff by written endorsement or for value without endorsement.

<p class="p4"><b>Transfer and assignment of a purchase money note and security agreement to a third party</b> did not destroy the purchase money character of the security interest, where the assignment did not refinance, renew, or modify the debtor's purchase money debt. Brooks v. First Franklin Fin. Corp., 74 Bankr. 418 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to sue on instrument despite failure to obtain proper endorsement.</b> - Where plaintiff establishes without dispute that plaintiff obtained possession of note by purchasing it for value from named payee, plaintiff acquires title to instrument and is entitled to sue to collect it, even if plaintiff failed to obtain a proper endorsement. Hazel v. Tharpe &amp; Brooks, Inc., 159 Ga. App. 415, 283 S.E.2d 653 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer without endorsement.</b> - Where holder of instrument payable to holder's order transfers it for value without endorsing it, transfer vests in transferee such title as transferor had therein, and transferee acquires, in addition, the right to have endorsement of transferor, although such transfer not effective to render transferee a holder in due course. Folsom v. Continental Adjustment Corp., 48 Ga. App. 435, 172 S.E. 833 (1934) (decided under former Ga. L. 1924, p. 126, <span class="s1">§</span> 49, subsequently codified as former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-420). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Delivery for value unaccompanied by written endorsement constitutes transfer, but not negotiation, of note within negotiable instruments law. Robbins v. Welfare Fin. Corp., 95 Ga. App. 90, 96 S.E.2d 892 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-420). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where it appears from allegations of petition that promisor executed negotiable note and that holder, who holds note without written endorsement, financed note and contract and is transferee of the note and its holder in due course, petition is not subject to general demurrer upon ground that holder may not bring suit on note in its own name. Stone v. Colonial Credit Co., 93 Ga. App. 348, 91 S.E.2d 835 (1956) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-420). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A transfer without endorsement, vesting transferee with legal title, although not effective to render transferee a holder in due course, permits transferee to bring suit in own name. Robbins v. Welfare Fin. Corp., 95 Ga. App. 90, 96 S.E.2d 892 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-420). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Transfer for value, without endorsement, vests in the transferee such title as transferor had, and transferee may bring suit thereon in own name. Northeast Factor &amp; Disct. Co. v. Mortgage Invs., Inc., 107 Ga. App. 705, 131 S.E.2d 221 (1963) (decided under prior law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Holder of note who is not payee may recover on it even though no transfer or endorsement appears thereon and holder's right, title and interest may be proved by parol. Associates Disct. Corp. v. Brantley, 102 Ga. App. 751, 117 S.E.2d 916 (1960) (decided under prior law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A transferee receives all of the title of transferor to a negotiable instrument and is entitled to sue thereon in transferee's own name, but, without endorsement, the instrument has not been negotiated and takes subject to all equities between maker or drawer and transferor. Jett v. Atlanta Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 104 Ga. App. 688, 123 S.E.2d 27 (1961) (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense against transferee with notice of equities.</b> - In suit by holder against maker of negotiable note, where it appeared that plaintiff acquired note after maturity from one who had acquired it before maturity and without notice of any defect, it was error to charge jury that defense pleaded by maker would be good as against plaintiff, whether or not person who transferred it to plaintiff was a bona fide holder for value and without notice. Houston v. Lundy, 45 Ga. App. 122, 163 S.E. 328 (1932) (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4535). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purchaser of a negotiable note, although with notice, either express or constructive, of equities and defenses as between maker and original payee, is protected in title and may recover on it if purchased, even without recourse, from one who took it, bona fide and without notice, from original payee. Houston v. Lundy, 45 Ga. App. 122, 163 S.E. 328 (1932) (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4535).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense that transfer not genuine.</b> - Payment of promissory note to supposed transferee, holding it by virtue of forged endorsement, will not protect maker or one who has assumed the debt, against payment to true owner; and consequently, in suit by such an alleged transferee to enforce liability against such parties, the assumer may utilize defense that alleged transfer by payee was not genuine. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-223).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inquiry into holder's title.</b> - In suit instituted by person claiming to be owner and holder of promissory note, for the purpose of recovering thereon against maker and another person alleged to have assumed the debt, it is permissible for the latter to inquire into plaintiff's title to note, if necessary either for protection or to let in any valid defense which that person seeks to make. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Enforcement by bank when O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-3-603 does not apply.</b> - Where plaintiff bank is holder of a check and there are no provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-603 which apply, the bank can enforce payment in its own name against drawer. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 110 Ga. App. 319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Incorporation into O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>11-3-420. - There is no statutory basis to conclude that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-301's incorporation into O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-420 limits a plaintiff's standing to bring a claim under <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-420.

<p class="p4"><b>Assignment for collection as defense.</b> - Contention that note has been assigned to collection agencies presents no defense where plaintiff is holder of the note and none of the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-603 (concerning discharge of liability to the extent of payment or satisfaction) prevent recovery. Wall v. Citizens &amp; S. Bank, 153 Ga. App. 29, 264 S.E.2d 523 (1980), overruled on other grounds by Southall v. State, 2017 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nongenuine transfer as defense.</b> - Payment of promissory note to supposed transferee, holding it by virtue of forged endorsement, will not protect maker or one who has assumed the debt against payment to true owner; and consequently, in suit by such an alleged transferee to enforce liability against such parties, the assumer may avail self of defense that alleged transfer by payee was not genuine. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-223).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inquiry into holder's title in suit by holder against maker.</b> - In suit instituted by person claiming to be owner and holder of promissory note, for the purpose of recovering thereon against maker and another person alleged to have assumed the debt, it is permissible for the latter to inquire into plaintiff's title to note, if necessary either for plaintiff's protection or to let in any valid defense which plaintiff seeks to make. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Claim."</b> - Word "claim" descends from the law merchant and indicates certain rights in instrument on which suit is based rather than mere reasons why alleged debtor is not liable for the fund. It is, however, to some extent broader than concept of legal title to instrument. Fulton Nat'l Bank v. Delco Corp., 128 Ga. App. 16, 195 S.E.2d 455 (1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-304).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Unclean hands did not apply.</b> - Since there was no dispute that the promissory notes at issue were authentic, that the buyers signed the notes, that the sellers' were the holders, or as to the amount due on the notes, and since a trial court did not err in finding that no novation occurred and that there were no other meritorious defenses, the trial court did not err in finding that the buyers had no defense to the sellers' suit seeking payment on the notes; however, the equitable doctrine of unclean hands had no application to an action at law, and the trial court was not authorized to reduce the amounts shown to be due and payable on the notes on account of its finding of unclean hands.

<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a defense under subsection (a) of this Code section, but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Immunity of holder fixed at time of negotiation.</b> - Immunity of holder in due course from defenses available to prior parties, such as want or failure of consideration, becomes fixed at time the instrument is negotiated and subsequent acts of maker short of making payment in full or being adjudicated a bankrupt cannot enhance, diminish or in any way affect right of holder in due course to enforce payment of the instrument free of defenses relative to its consideration.

<p class="p4">Absence or failure of consideration are matters of defense in a suit on notes as against any person not a holder in due course. However, the instant that a negotiable instrument is negotiated to a holder in due course defense relative to its consideration is precluded. Credit Equip. Corp. v. Pendley, 97 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Bank's defenses as holder for value.</b> - Where a bank had credited a seller's account with the amount of a buyer's check and subsequently, the buyer issued a stop-payment order on the check but, by the time the bank received notification, the seller had spent almost all of the buyer's check, the bank was not merely a holder of the buyer's check but was a holder in due course and subject only to the defenses enumerated in subsection (2).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Good faith of bank in issue.</b> - In a case under the former version of this section on the issue of a bank's status as a "holder in due course," evidence that the bank may have acted in bad faith when it accepted deposits to the account of an overdrawn depositor and failed to place a hold on the account precluded summary judgment for the bank.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Fraud in the factum."</b> - "Fraud in the factum" is the only type fraud available under the Uniform Commercial Code as a defense against a holder in due course; mere allegations of misrepresentation are not sufficient to prove "fraud in the factum" to withstand plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.

<p class="p4">The only type of fraud assertable against a holder in due course under former paragraph (2)(c) is fraud in factum. Fraud in the inducement, which does not go to the essence of the agreement but merely induces the party to enter the agreement, would not have the same effect because it would render the instrument merely voidable and capable of transfer.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unavailable defenses.</b> - Where negotiable notes are given in renewal of trade acceptances in hands of holder in due course, defense of failure of consideration is not available to maker against such holder, regardless of whether maker was aware of that defense when notes were made.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of showing status as holder.</b> - In suit on negotiable instruments, burden is initially on party suing to show first that one is a holder of the instruments sued on. James Talcott, Inc. v. Allahabad Bank, Ltd., 444 F.2d 451 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 940, 92 S. Ct. 280, 30 L. Ed. 2d 253 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When burden of proving one is holder in due course shifts.</b> - Production of instrument entitles a holder to recover on it unless defendant establishes a defense, and burden of proving that one is a holder in due course does not shift to holder until it is shown that a defense exists. James Talcott, Inc. v. Allahabad Bank, Ltd., 444 F.2d 451 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 940, 92 S. Ct. 280, 30 L. Ed. 2d 253 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense of fraud in the factum.</b> - Under Uniform Commercial Code, defense of fraud in inducement cannot be asserted against a holder in due course. There is no protection against a defense of fraud in the factum, however. FDIC v. Willis, 497 F. Supp. 272 (S.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under defense of fraud in the factum, the fraud which defendants attempt to show must be in the factum, or within the loan instrument itself. Such a defense fails, however, where essential terms of note are correct; fact that the instrument incorrectly reflects that loan was secured does not affect validity of underlying transaction. FDIC v. Willis, 497 F. Supp. 272 (S.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party-to-the-transaction rule.</b> - For a discussion of the party-to-the-transaction rule as a defense to the holder in due course status, see Design Eng'g, Constr. Int'l, Inc. v. Cessna Fin. Corp., 164 Ga. App. 159, 296 S.E.2d 195 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Before the "party-to-the-transaction rule" may be asserted as a defense against a holder in due course, there must be evidence showing that the assignee was an "original party" to the underlying transaction or that the assignee exercised sufficient "control" of the underlying transaction to authorize a finding that the assignee was, in reality, a party to the original transaction. GECC v. Smith, 183 Ga. App. 897, 360 S.E.2d 443, cert. denied, 183 Ga. App. 906, 360 S.E.2d 443 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion to dismiss denied.</b> - Regarding requirement of former subsection (1)(c) of this section, fact that copy of a check attached as exhibit to petition bears a date more than one year prior to time instrument was alleged to have been transferred to plaintiff bank does not subject petition to general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) on ground that petition shows bank had notice the check was overdue. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 110 Ga. App. 319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Allegation that plaintiff bank gave credit for check prior to receiving knowledge or notice of dishonor and without notice of defense against or claim to it on part of any person is sufficient as against a general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) to allege compliance with requirement of former subsection (1)(c) of this section of a holder in due course. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 110 Ga. App. 319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setoff.</b> - Where holder of promissory note other than payee named, who has received same in dishonor, institutes suit thereon against maker, the latter may set off to extent of amount due on the note, any sum which may be due from payee to maker which is in any way connected with the debt sued on or the transaction out of which it sprang. Srochi v. Kamensky, 118 Ga. App. 182, 162 S.E.2d 889 (1968), later appeal, 121 Ga. App. 518, 174 S.E.2d 263 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Illegality determined by law of forum.</b> - This section leaves determination of what transactions are illegal to statute law of forum. Middle Ga. Livestock Sales v. Commercial Bank &amp; Trust Co., 123 Ga. App. 733, 182 S.E.2d 533 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-305).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Holder in due course of check given for stolen property.</b> - Holder in due course for value of check given by innocent maker for purchase of cattle which turned out to have been stolen may not recover value of such check from maker. Middle Ga. Livestock Sales v. Commercial Bank &amp; Trust Co., 123 Ga. App. 733, 182 S.E.2d 533 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-305).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provisions qualified by O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>13-7-7. - The broad language of this section is qualified by the restrictive provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-7-7, limiting defenses to demands in some way connected with the debt sued on or the transaction out of which it sprang. Srochi v. Kamensky, 121 Ga. App. 518, 174 S.E.2d 263 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rights of original payee.</b> - Original payee of note, as party to transaction for sale of securities, of which note is but a part, is limited in claim on the note to rights of one not a holder in due course. Morris v. Durbin, 123 Ga. App. 383, 180 S.E.2d 925 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchaser acquiring note after default in an installment.</b> - A deed to land to secure debt and note executed in connection therewith may be transferred and assigned. A purchaser who acquires such note after default as to one of its installments is not a holder in due course, but takes instrument with notice of its dishonor, and subject to any defense or equity which could be pleaded as against original payee. Verner v. McLarty, 213 Ga. 472, 99 S.E.2d 890 (1957), overruled on other grounds, Ward v. Watkins, 219 Ga. 629, 135 S.E.2d 421 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-502 and 14-508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purchaser who acquires note after default in an installment is not a holder in due course, but takes with notice of its dishonor, and subject to any defense or equity which could be pleaded as against original payee. Browning v. Rewis, 152 Ga. App. 45, 262 S.E.2d 174 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability of drawer.</b> - While drawer of check has right to stop payment of it at any time before it has been certified or paid by drawee, drawer remains liable unless the drawer has a defense good against the holder. Tidwell v. Bank of Tifton, 115 Ga. App. 555, 155 S.E.2d 451 (1967) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Drawer is liable to holder absent existence of defense good against the latter. Bob's Radio Serv., Inc. v. F.P. Plaza, Inc., 125 Ga. App. 133, 186 S.E.2d 552 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bank carrying an account with another bank has right to stop payment on its check, however, it remains liable for value of the item unless legal and valid defense is available to it. Fulton Nat'l Bank v. Delco Corp., 128 Ga. App. 16, 195 S.E.2d 455 (1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Possession.</b> - Although the corporation met the requirements for being a holder in due course to the extent that it took the promissory note regarding the mortgage for value, in good faith, and without notice of any claim to the instrument, the corporation was not a holder in due course because it was not in possession of the promissory note at the time it purchased the mortgage; since it was not in possession, it failed to achieve holder-in-due-course status and the bank's security interest prevailed. Provident Bank v. Morequity, Inc., 262 Ga. App. 331, 585 S.E.2d 625 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Holders Not in Due Course - Claims</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Word "claim"</b> descends from the law merchant and indicates certain rights in instrument on which suit is based rather than mere reasons why alleged debtor is not liable for the fund. It is, however, to some extent broader than concept of legal title to instrument. Fulton Nat'l Bank v. Delco Corp., 128 Ga. App. 16, 195 S.E.2d 455 (1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Scope of claims covered by this section.</b> - Valid claims under this section include not only claims of legal title, but all liens, equities or other claims of right against the instrument or its proceeds, as well as claims to rescind prior negotiation and to recover instrument or its proceeds. Fulton Nat'l Bank v. Delco Corp., 128 Ga. App. 16, 195 S.E.2d 455 (1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claims of third party defending action on behalf of defendant drawee bank.</b> - If third party claims ownership in uncashed check as well as ownership of fund represented by it, then it is a third-party claim available to defendant drawee bank, the party prima facie liable if third party is defending action on its behalf. Fulton Nat'l Bank v. Delco Corp., 128 Ga. App. 16, 195 S.E.2d 455 (1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Holders Not in Due Course - Defenses</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Immunity of holder fixed at time of negotiation.</b> - Immunity of holder in due course from defenses available to prior parties, such as want or failure of consideration, becomes fixed at time the instrument is negotiated and subsequent acts of maker short of making payment in full or being adjudicated a bankrupt cannot enhance, diminish or in any way affect right of holder in due course to enforce payment of the instrument free of defenses relative to its consideration. Credit Equip. Corp. v. Pendley, 97 Ga. App. 868, 104 S.E.2d 718 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-305 and 14-507). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Absences or failure of consideration are matters of defense in a suit on notes as against any person not a holder in due course. However, the instant that a negotiable instrument is negotiated to a holder in due course defense relative to its consideration is precluded. Credit Equip. Corp. v. Pendley, 97 Ga. App. 868, 104 S.E.2d 718 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-305, 14-507, and 14-508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Defenses outlined in former paragraph (c) all relate to creation of valid obligation</b> and not to restrictions upon existing ones. Tatum v. Bank of Cumming, 135 Ga. App. 675, 218 S.E.2d 677 (1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense of payment in full.</b> - One acquiring promissory note who is not a holder in due course is subject to defense of payment in full. Northside Bldg. &amp; Inv. Co. v. Finance Co. of Am., 119 Ga. App. 131, 166 S.E.2d 608 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment of installment to payee without notice of prior transfer of instrument.</b> - Where maker pays installment to payee without notice that payee had no authority to accept payment, in a suit by transferee, maker can set up the payment as a defense even though transferor had not remitted it to transferee. Northside Bldg. &amp; Inv. Co. v. Finance Co. of Am., 119 Ga. App. 131, 166 S.E.2d 608 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Fraud which induces a party to enter into contract</b> resulting in execution of negotiable instrument is a good defense to action on instrument by original payee. Johnston v. Dollar, 83 Ga. App. 219, 63 S.E.2d 408 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Ashburn Bank v. Childress, 120 Ga. App. 632, 171 S.E.2d 768 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-306). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Absence or failure of consideration is a defense only as against one not a holder in due course, and inadequacy of consideration does not prevent holder of a note from enjoying protection of a bona fide holder.

<p class="p4"><b>Limitation on defense of setoff.</b> - Defense of setoff is available but it was apparently intention of legislature to limit this defense to demands in some way connected with debt sued on, or transaction out of which it sprang. Srochi v. Kamensky, 118 Ga. App. 182, 162 S.E.2d 889 (1968), later appeal, 121 Ga.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of and authority to make each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under subsection (a) of Code Section 11-3-402. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection (a) of this Code section, a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under Code Section 11-3-301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the issues dealt with in the provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4290, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-223, 14-305, 14-405, 14-505, and former Code Section 11-3-307 are included in the annotations for this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former subsection (2) inapplicable to nonnegotiable notes.</b> - Where language of promissory note revealed that it was not payable on demand or at a definite time, and was therefore not negotiable, it was not subject to former subsection (2) of this section. Barton v. Scott Hudgens Realty &amp; Mtg., Inc., 136 Ga. App. 565, 222 S.E.2d 126 (1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Direct action on instrument without alleging facts creating underlying obligation.</b> - Under Uniform Commercial Code, as formerly, one may bring action upon debt evidenced by commercial paper in form of suing directly on instrument which imports its own consideration without setting forth facts creating obligation evidenced by the paper. Riddick v. Evans, 155 Ga. App. 868, 274 S.E.2d 40 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Prima facie case for holder.</b> - With admission by defendant of execution of note to plaintiff, plaintiff has a prima facie right to judgment sought and defendant then has burden of establishing any claimed defense to the action. Crosby v. Jordan, 123 Ga. App. 83, 179 S.E.2d 537 (1970); Freezamatic Corp. v. Brigadier Indus. Corp., 125 Ga. App. 767, 189 S.E.2d 108 (1972); Malone v. Price, 138 Ga. App. 514, 226 S.E.2d 623 (1976); Brooks v. McCorkle, 174 Ga. App. 132, 329 S.E.2d 214 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where evidence establishes that face amount of notes at time of execution was due to plaintiff payee by defendant maker, and defendant admits execution of such notes which bear defendant's signature, plaintiff has made out a case as a matter of law as to face amount of notes and specified interest. General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Solomon, 124 Ga. App. 308, 183 S.E.2d 573 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Proof of possession by production of instrument entitles holder to recover on it unless opposing party establishes a defense. James Talcott, Inc. v. Allahabad Bank, Ltd., 444 F.2d 451 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 940, 92 S. Ct. 280, 30 L. Ed. 2d 253 (1971); Brooks v. McCorkle, 174 Ga. App. 132, 329 S.E.2d 214 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where holder introduced promissory note, established its authenticity and that its consideration was purchase of half interest in partnership business, and maker failed to establish an affirmative defense, holder made out prima-facie case entitling the holder to recovery on note. Peters v. Thomason, 157 Ga. App. 513, 277 S.E.2d 798 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Introduction of a promissory note (together with related documents, where appropriate) makes a prima facie case for the plaintiff and imposes upon the defendant the burden of raising defenses in rebuttal of the plaintiff's evidence. First Nat'l Bank v. Damil, Inc., 171 Ga. App. 237, 319 S.E.2d 54 (1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rebuttable presumption.</b> - While a party is entitled ordinarily to rely on a notarized signature to sue on an indemnification agreement, where the evidence showed that the plaintiff knew months before filing the action that the defendant denied both knowing anything about or having signed the agreement, and that this denial was supported by a handwriting examiner's opinion that the defendant did not sign the document, any presumption arising from the notarized signature was rebutted. Additionally, as the evidence showed there noticeably was no notary seal on that portion of the agreement, purporting to acknowledge the alleged signature, the notarization did not comply with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-17-6(a)(1), and, accordingly, the notary's signature standing alone did not give rise even to a rebuttable presumption. Fabe v. Floyd, 199 Ga. App. 322, 405 S.E.2d 265 (1991), cert. denied, 199 Ga. App. 906, 405 S.E.2d 265 (1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inquiry into plaintiff's title.</b> - In suit instituted by person claiming to be owner and holder of promissory note for purpose of recovering thereon against maker and another alleged to have assumed the debt, it is permissible for the later to inquire into plaintiff's title to the note, if necessary either for the other's protection or to let in any valid defense which the other seeks to make. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-223 and 14-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guarantor personally liable on promissory note.</b> - Trial court did not err by finding a guarantor personally liable on a promissory note because the trial court correctly found that the language of the promissory note, the unconditional guaranty, and the modification to the promissory note were unambiguous, and since the documents' provisions were clear, the trial court's proper role was to apply the terms as written; in the guaranty, the guarantor expressly waived all notices or defenses to which the guarantor could be entitled under the guaranty, to the extent permitted by law, and because the guarantor failed to assert any defense based upon an alleged incompetency to enter into a contract at the time the guarantor executed the guaranty, and because the guarantor failed to show that the guaranty's broad waiver of defenses was prohibited by statute or public policy, the guarantor was bound thereby.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signature presumed to be authorized.</b> - Signature executed as provided for in former Code section <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-403(3) is presumed to be authorized, and if one desires to challenge its effectiveness it must be specifically denied in pleadings. Modern Free &amp; Accepted Masons of World v. Cliff M. Averett, Inc., 118 Ga. App. 641, 165 S.E.2d 166 (1968) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Until evidence is introduced to support finding that signature is forged or unauthorized, party claiming under the signature is not required to prove its authenticity. Perini Corp. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Apparent authority of agent must be specifically denied.</b> - Where petition alleged that drawer had stopped payment on a check on drawer's account, bearing drawer's imprinted trade name, underneath which appeared signature of drawer's wife who had apparent authority as agent or representative, in absence of pleading that wife had no such authority to draw checks on that account, this must be construed as an admission of wife's authority. Gate City Furn. Co. v. Rumsey, 115 Ga. App. 753, 156 S.E.2d 221 (1967) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proving genuineness of endorsement.</b> - Where one sued upon negotiable instrument, which is complete and regular upon its face, files answer under oath denying that transfer and endorsement to plaintiff is genuine, but which answer does not amount to a plea of non est factum, burden is cast upon plaintiff to prove genuineness of endorsement before such note can be introduced into evidence. Equitable Disct. Corp. v. Guest, 103 Ga. App. 258, 118 S.E.2d 864 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-405).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equivocal testimony did not overcome presumption of authenticity.</b> - Note that stated that it was "given under the hand and seal of each of the undersigned," and the appearance of the notation "(seal)" after the debtors' signatures was proof of the authenticity of the signatures; one debtor's equivocal testimony regarding recognizing the note as the one the debtor signed was insufficient to overcome the presumption of the signatures' authenticity. Thomas v. Summers, 329 Ga. App. 250, 764 S.E.2d 578 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bankruptcy debtor failed to show that the debtor's signature on a personal guaranty of a substantial business loan debt was a forgery since conflicting expert testimony was equivocal and the debtor's asserted lack of memory of signing the guaranty was inconsistent with the intelligent debtor's business experience and acumen in dealing with the lender which always required personal guarantees.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment inappropriate when validity of signature questionable.</b> - Trial court erred in granting a bank's motion for summary judgment in the bank's action seeking the repayment of a loan because the debtor specifically denied in the answer the validity of the signature on a note, which raised the defense of non est factum, created a factual question as to the authenticity of the signature, and kept the signature from being deemed admitted under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-308; as the nonmoving party to a summary judgment motion, the debtor had to only produce or point to any evidence that gave rise to a triable issue of material fact, which the debtor did by submitting an affidavit attesting that the the debtor did not sign the note, and given that the debtor's sworn statements were unrefuted, the affidavit had to be taken as true for purposes of deciding the motion.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of establishing defense.</b> - Where suit is brought upon promissory note, and defendant pleads that note was without consideration, burden is on defendant to sustain plea by showing by preponderance of evidence the want of consideration. Morgan's, Inc. v. Mons, 79 Ga. App. 525, 54 S.E.2d 498 (1949), later appeal, 83 Ga. App. 814, 65 S.E.2d 34 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-305). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">With admission by defendant of execution of note to plaintiff, the plaintiff had a prima facie right to judgment sought and defendant then had burden of establishing any claimed defense to action. FDIC v. Kucera Bldrs., Inc., 503 F. Supp. 967 (N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where it was undisputed that defendant-maker executed note evidencing indebtedness and plaintiff held all right, title and interest that payee originally held in said note, plaintiff established prima-facie right to judgment sought and burden shifted to defendants to interpose viable defense. Slappey Bldrs., Inc. v. FDIC, 157 Ga. App. 343, 277 S.E.2d 328 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a plaintiff established execution of a note, the burden was on the defendant to establish an affirmative defense, but on plaintiff's motion for summary judgment it was plaintiff's burden to establish non-existence of a genuine issue of fact as to each affirmative defense, and all doubts were resolved against plaintiff as movant; plaintiff's papers are carefully scrutinized, while the respondents' papers are treated with considerable indulgence. Maddox v. Leaphart, 214 Ga. App. 340, 447 S.E.2d 694 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The trial court erred when it ruled at an initial traverse hearing that the payors under a promissory note were liable solely because they admitted the genuineness of their signatures, since the payee would not have been entitled to recover fully or at all if the payors had totally or partially proven their defense of breach of contract. Lowery v. Dallis, 237 Ga. App. 309, 513 S.E.2d 740 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to establish defense.</b> - Since it appears conclusively from evidence that defendant had not established any defense to the note, defendant cannot dispute title of plaintiff as transferee upon ground that plaintiff was not a bona fide purchaser for value. Jones v. Roper, 39 Ga. App. 309, 147 S.E. 156 (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4290). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the maker of a note was unable to establish a valid defense to payment, the payee was entitled as a matter of law to recover on the note. Brooks v. McCorkle, 174 Ga. App. 132, 329 S.E.2d 214 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in denying a seller's motion for summary judgment in the seller's action against the buyers to recover upon a promissory note because the buyers failed to make payments on the note, and the buyers did not show damages in any amount from the alleged failure of consideration; the note was supported by adequate consideration because the buyers took immediate possession of the seller's business and began operating the business as the buyers' own. West v. Diduro, 312 Ga. App. 591, 718 S.E.2d 815 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0522, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 279 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere denial of indebtedness is not defense.</b> - Defendant's answer admitting execution of the notes but denying indebtedness because the notes were "part of a series of actions dealing with stock of the two companies, stock options and other matters" is not a defense to an action on promissory notes. Freezamatic Corp. v. Brigadier Indus. Corp., 125 Ga. App. 767, 189 S.E.2d 108 (1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where defendant admits execution of note, mere denial of debt for various general reasons not contained in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-8 does not constitute a defense under this section. Malone v. Price, 138 Ga. App. 514, 226 S.E.2d 623 (1976) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Receipt of money by one comaker.</b> - Where two parties execute note as comakers, one comaker is not allowed to plead failure of consideration because that party does not receive money named on face of note. If either of them receives money, both are bound. Mercantile Nat'l Bank v. Berger, 129 Ga. App. 707, 200 S.E.2d 921 (1973), aff'd, 231 Ga. 680, 203 S.E.2d 479 (1974) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense that transfer by payee not genuine.</b> - Payment of promissory note to supposed transferee, holding by virtue of forged endorsement, will not protect maker or one who has assumed the debt against payment to true owner; and, consequently, in a suit by such alleged transferee to enforce liability against such parties, assumer may utilize defense that alleged transfer by payee was not genuine. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-223).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">An accommodation party argued that no liability should arise on certain notes, because commercial loan officers of the bank breached an oral agreement not to make loans to the accommodated parties without that party's prior knowledge and consent. The accommodated party's signature on the notes sued on, the authenticity of which was not contested, eliminated this defense. Richards v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 199 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Pleading defense of denial of execution of note.</b> - In debtor-creditor case, general denial by plaintiff of allegations in defendant's counterclaim was sufficient to raise defense of non est factum, since that defense need no longer be affirmatively pleaded; and, therefore, plaintiff did not admit the signature within meaning of this section. Spurlock v. Commercial Banking Co., 151 Ga. App. 649, 260 S.E.2d 912 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Borrower's general denial of the allegations contained in lender's complaint was sufficient to raise the defense of denial of the execution of a note, which, in turn, meant that borrower did not admit the signature within the meaning of this Code section. Jones v. Kim, 189 Ga. App. 5, 374 S.E.2d 820 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - The General Assembly intended that both the name of the organization and the office (official capacity) of an authorized individual be included before a signature would be deemed "a signature made in a representative capacity." In other words, former subsection (3) of this section relieves the signer of an instrument from the burden of establishing that one signed it in a representative capacity, as required by former subsection (2), but only when the conditions stated therein are met. Yeomans v. Coleman, Meadows, Pate Drug Co., 167 Ga. App. 646, 307 S.E.2d 121 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One signing document without showing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>signature "in a representative capacity" is personally obligated</b> under this section. Barnett v. Leasing Int'l, Inc., 151 Ga. App. 715, 261 S.E.2d 452 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Absent proof that signature was made as representative, this section applies, resulting in personal liability. Casey v. Carrollton Ford Co., 152 Ga. App. 105, 262 S.E.2d 255 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">In an action following the default of a promissory note, the trial court properly granted the defendant summary judgment because the defendant signed the promissory note solely in a representative capacity of a limited liability company and was not personally liable and the plaintiff knew that the defendant had not signed in a personal capacity.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant liable when note signed in individual capacity.</b> - Although the stationery on which the note was typed showed that the defendant served as president of the corporation, the note itself was signed in an individual and not a representative capacity and thus the defendant was personally liable for the note. Avery v. Whitworth, 202 Ga. App. 508, 414 S.E.2d 725 (1992) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403); Talmadge v. Respess, 224 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>No indication of agency appearing on instrument.</b> - Where defendant admits to executing instrument but contends that it was done in corporate capacity at request of plaintiff's representative or agent, defendant is still personally obligated if instrument neither names person represented nor shows that representative signed in representative capacity.

<p class="p4">Where the contract itself was ambiguous as to the capacity in which defendant signed because defendant's signature appeared above the name of the allegedly represented entity but failed to reflect defendant's office or otherwise show that defendant was signing in a representative capacity, the jury could conclude that defendant signed the contract in an individual capacity, and not as an agent, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for directed verdict.

Southern Oxygen Supply Co. v. Golian, 230 Ga. 405, 197 S.E.2d 374 (1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One signing as administrator, when one had no such authority.</b> - Defendant's contention that at time of executing note sued on one was acting as agent for an estate and that it was intention of defendant and plaintiff payee that defendant not be bound individually was without merit; defendant could not make note as agent for the estate because defendant was without authority to do so and the obligation was defendant's individual undertaking. Burk v. Hammond, 98 Ga. App. 416, 105 S.E.2d 807 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-220).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Representative capacity of signature.</b> - Seller was not personally liable to a developer on a real estate contract even though the seller did not sign the contract in a representative capacity where the evidence, including the deeds from the seller to the developer, showed that the seller was a corporation and that the developer was aware of that fact.

<p class="p4">"Except as otherwise established" clause in former subsection (2) of this section authorizes admission of parol evidence as between original parties to the instrument to prove signature was made in representative capacity. West v. FDIC, 149 Ga. App. 342, 254 S.E.2d 392, aff'd, 244 Ga. 396, 260 S.E.2d 89 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If signature made in representative form, or principal is named, parol evidence admissible.</b> - If instrument names person represented but signature is not made in representative form, or if there is a signature in representative form but principal's name does not appear, parol evidence is admissible in litigation between immediate parties to a note to prove capacity in which signature was affixed. Phoenix Air Conditioning Co. v. Pound, 123 Ga. App. 523, 181 S.E.2d 719 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The presence of an unattested corporate seal</b> and an individual signature on a promissory note placed the instrument within former paragraph (2)(b) so as to permit the introduction of parol evidence to show agency. Hartkopf v. Heinrich Ad. Berkemann, 200 Ga. App. 355, 408 S.E.2d 450, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 896, 408 S.E.2d 450 (1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where one signs with no indication of agency, parol evidence inadmissible to establish agency.</b> - One executing note in own name with nothing on its face showing agency cannot introduce parol evidence to show that it was executed for a principal, or that payee knew that it was intended to be executed as agent. Bostwick Banking Co. v. Arnold, 227 Ga. 18, 178 S.E.2d 890 (1970); Barnett v. Leasing Int'l, Inc., 151 Ga. App. 715, 261 S.E.2d 452 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If one signs name in nonrepresentative form to instrument which does not name the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>principal, notwithstanding that one is authorized and can prove such, that person is personally obligated thereon and parol evidence is not admissible to alter the obligation. Phoenix Air Conditioning Co. v. Pound, 123 Ga. App. 523, 181 S.E.2d 719 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where parol evidence is conflicting.</b> - Where a note has all the appearances of a personal, rather than a corporate, obligation and the parol evidence offered by the parties is conflicting, the trial court, as the trier of fact, is authorized to conclude from the evidence that the note was not signed in a representative capacity. Yeomans v. Coleman, Meadows, Pate Drug Co., 167 Ga. App. 646, 307 S.E.2d 121 (1983); Cooley v. Dickerson &amp; Swift Entertainment, Inc., 177 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>A forged endorsement is wholly ineffective</b> to pass any title to or confer any interest in the instrument. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. New York Cas. Co., 84 Ga. App. 47, 65 S.E.2d 461 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-223).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment over forged endorsement not protection against true owner.</b> - Payment of a promissory note to a supposed transferee, holding it by virtue of a forged endorsement, will not protect the maker or one who has assumed the debt, against payment to the true owner; and, consequently, in a suit by such an alleged transferee to enforce liability against such parties, the assumer may avail self of the defense that the alleged transfer by the payee was not genuine. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-223).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Former </b><span class="s1"><b>§§</b></span><b> 11-3-404(1) and 11-3-406 must be read together.</b> Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Estoppel based on negligence.</b> - Former paragraph (1) does not establish separate and distinct estoppel by negligence defense for payor who pays instrument over forged endorsement. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When one who has paid an instrument asserts that another is estopped by negligence from denying that unauthorized signature on it operates as own, payor personally must have paid in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards of one's business. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When payor seeks to estop or preclude another from asserting that payor's signature on an instrument is forged under former paragraph (1) of this section and the basis for asserting this estoppel or preclusion is neglect of one whose "signature" appears, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-406 controls. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>The word "precluded" has been held to be synonymous with "estoppel,"</b> and not to include ratification or adoption of the instrument or signature thereon unless these involve also the elements of estoppel. To create such an estoppel, there must be actual injury or damage. Beeland v. Clark, 47 Ga. App. 77, 169 S.E. 681 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-223).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inquiry into plaintiff's title permissible.</b> - In suit instituted by person claiming to be owner and holder of promissory note for purpose of recovering thereon against maker and another alleged to have assumed the debt, it is permissible for the latter to inquire into plaintiff's title to the note, if necessary either for that one's protection or to let in any valid defense which that individual may seek to make. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-223 and 14-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of forged checks.</b> - Bank was properly granted summary judgment in a suit filed against it by a law firm for negligently accepting stolen checks and for conversion with regards to blank-endorsed cashier's checks, as such were bearer paper transferable by possession alone; however, because a fact issue remained as to whether it acted in good faith in accepting forged checks, it could not be a holder in due course, and summary judgment on that issue was improper.

<p class="p4"><b>"Impostor"</b> refers to impersonation not to false representation that party is authorized agent of payee; this section does not cover one who represents self as agent of a principal and procures check payable to order of the principal.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicable in forged check cases.</b> - Nothing in this section limits its application to cases in which drawer's signature is authorized.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for payor asserting estoppel.</b> - When one who has paid an instrument asserts that another is estopped by negligence from denying that unauthorized signature on it operates as one's own, payor personally must have paid in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards of one's business. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-406). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fact question remained whether a bank violated the reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing when it violated known commercial banking practices by accepting checks made payable to a law firm into a thief's personal account, where the bank also serviced the firm's business accounts and therefore knew that the firm normally placed a restrictive endorsement stamp on checks made payable to it, as the bank was on heightened notice of the irregularity of the endorsements and therefore could be held to have dealt with the firm unfairly by not making inquiry into the legitimacy of those endorsements. Gerber &amp; Gerber, P.C. v. Regions Bank, 266 Ga. App. 8, 596 S.E.2d 174 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Questions of fact.</b> - Reasonable commercial standards and whether they were met under circumstances are initially questions of fact. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-406).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The appropriate inquiry</b> is whether a reasonable man in accordance with reasonable commercial standards would be put on notice of some impropriety appearing either from form of the instrument and its endorsements or from knowledge of facts outside the instrument itself. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-406).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to inquire into validity of endorsements</b> does not preclude bank from asserting defense of commercial reasonableness as a matter of law. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., 153 Ga. App. 735, 266 S.E.2d 254 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-406).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank accepting check with "a patently irregular endorsement"</b> does not comply with reasonable commercial standards, and fact that depositor of check is a customer of the bank does not absolve bank of its duty to inquire. National Bank v. Refrigerated Transp. Co., 147 Ga. App. 240, 248 S.E.2d 496 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-406).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Bank's conduct in opening accounts which had not been authorized</b> by its customer and then accepting checks written on the accounts on the single signature of the customer's employee, thereby facilitating the employee's embezzlement scheme, was not in accordance with reasonable commercial standards.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>To discharge parties, alteration must change obligation.</b> - Absent alteration or change in obligation of promissory note, alteration does not operate to discharge parties from their obligations. Franco v. Bank of Forest Park, 118 Ga. App. 700, 165 S.E.2d 593 (1968) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-407).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Material alteration.</b> - That is material which might become material, and any alteration which may in any event alter rights, duties, or obligations of person sought to be charged, is material in the legal sense. Cook v. Parks, 46 Ga. App. 749, 169 S.E. 208 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-907). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If legal import and effect of instrument is in fact changed, it does not matter how trivial the change may be, or whether it may be beneficial or detrimental to party sought to be charged on contract, as where it changes evidence or mode of proof. Cook v. Parks, 46 Ga. App. 749, 169 S.E. 208 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-907). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">That alteration was fraudulently made for purpose of causing actual injury, or that it did bring about injury, is not the test of materiality. It is equally unimportant whether alteration was beneficial or injurious to party whom it is sought to charge on the instrument. The sole question is whether rights of promissor have been materially affected; whether effect of instrument is the same as when signed. Cook v. Parks, 46 Ga. App. 749, 169 S.E. 208 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Addition of attesting witness which extends liability or affects proof of execution.</b> - Where addition of attesting witness to instrument has effect of extending liability under statute of limitations, or of facilitating or interfering in any manner with proof of execution of instrument, procuring of a witness to sign as an attesting witness after execution of instrument, without consent of maker, is material and constitutes an alteration. Cook v. Parks, 46 Ga. App. 749, 169 S.E. 208 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Addition of names of a comaker and witness.</b> - Both addition of name of a comaker and name of an official witness to a negotiable instrument containing a bill of sale to secure a debt, would be material alterations as to defendant maker, if made without defendant's consent. Williams v. F.S. Royster Guano Co., 67 Ga. App. 711, 21 S.E.2d 349 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Check not assignment of funds with drawee.</b> - A check itself does not operate as an assignment of any part of the funds to credit of drawer with drawee bank, and the latter is not liable to holder unless and until it accepts or certifies the check. Salzburger Bank v. Standard Oil Co., 173 Ga. 722, 161 S.E. 584 (1931) (decided under former Ga.

<p class="p4">A check does not in and of itself operate as an assignment of any part of drawer's funds deposited with drawee bank, but is merely an order upon such bank to pay from drawer's account. Lambeth v. Lewis, 114 Ga. App. 191, 150 S.E.2d 462 (1966); Harris v. Harbin Lumber Co. (In re Ellison), 31 Bankr. 545 (Bankr.

<p class="p4"><b>Bill not assignment of funds with drawee.</b> - A bill in and of itself does not operate as an assignment of funds in hands of drawee available for payment thereof, and drawee is not liable on bill unless and until the drawee accepts same. Salzburger Bank v. Standard Oil Co., 173 Ga. 722, 161 S.E. 584 (1931) (decided under former Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This rule does not do away with doctrine of equitable assignment.</b> - Rule that checks by themselves do not operate as assignments of funds in drawee's hands and do not operate as assignment of any part of funds to credit of drawer with bank, does not do away with doctrine of equitable assignment of funds to credit of drawers of such instruments in banks upon which they are drawn. Salzburger Bank v. Standard Oil Co., 173 Ga. 722, 161 S.E. 584 (1931) (decided under former Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certification of check not assignment until delivery.</b> - While under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-1707, the certification of a check, even if procured by drawer, amounts to assignment of the fund in the sense that it operates to withdraw it from deposit account of drawer, the mere fact of such certification by the drawer does not, before delivery of the check, operate as an assignment of the fund to payee. McIntire v. Raskin, 42 Ga. App. 303, 155 S.E. 799 (1930), rev'd on other grounds, 173 Ga. 746, 161 S.E. 363 (1931) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-1707).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance required for right of action.</b> - Under this section, holder or payee of check which has not been accepted or certified has no right of action against drawee bank based upon its failure or refusal to honor the check, even though at time check was presented for payment, bank had sufficient funds of drawer on deposit to pay it. Georgia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Hadarits, 111 Ga. App. 195, 141 S.E.2d 172, rev'd on other grounds, 221 Ga. 125, 143 S.E.2d 627 (1965) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-409).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Presumption is that a check is only intended as conditional payment,</b> and if dishonored, and the holder is not guilty of laches causing loss to drawer, the latter is liable upon original cause or debt for which check was given. Hiatt v. Edwards, 52 Ga. App. 152, 182 S.E. 634 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-1707).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remedy upon dishonor.</b> - Upon presentment of check as to which payment was refused, the check was dishonored, and plaintiff's remedy, as a holder, was "against the drawers and endorsers," not the defendant bank and its agent, neither of whom owed plaintiff a duty. Stewart v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 138 Ga. App. 209, 225 S.E.2d 761 (1976); Green Property Corp. v. O'Callaghan, Saunders &amp; Stumm, 177 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment.</b> - After delivery of check, and before dishonor, drawer cannot be garnished as debtor of payee in respect to debt for which check is given. Hiatt v. Edwards, 52 Ga. App. 152, 182 S.E. 634 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-1707).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of check, voluntary and by operation of law.</b> - Check may be revoked at any time by drawer before it has been certified, accepted, or paid by the bank, and is revoked by operation of law ten days after death of drawer, although drawee bank is not liable where it has in good faith honored such instrument without knowledge of depositor's death. Lambeth v. Lewis, 114 Ga. App. 191, 150 S.E.2d 462 (1966) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-409).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">If check is certified at instance of payee, bank then becomes absolute debtor of holder, drawers are released, and check is regarded as paid as between the drawers and holder.

Other factors which have been required to be shown in order to determine whether a party can claim this status include the purpose in signing the instrument, and the intent of the parties to the instrument. Bank S. v. Jones, 185 Ga. App. 125, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1987), cert. denied, 185 Ga. App. 909, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Accommodated party need not be actual party to note.</b> - The concept of an "accommodation party" as it is recognized in Georgia is a broad one, and there is no requirement that the accommodated party personally be an actual party to the note. Scott v. Citizens Bank, 188 Ga. App. 618, 373 S.E.2d 633 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The fact that a note may have been signed by defendant in the capacity of the maker thereof and that a bank's president personally did not sign the note in any capacity whatsoever would not preclude a finding that, under the existing circumstances, defendant, in signing the note, was in actuality signing it as an accommodation party for the bank's president. Scott v. Citizens Bank, 188 Ga. App. 618, 373 S.E.2d 633 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compensation irrelevant to status.</b> - One person who lends name to another party to negotiable instrument in any capacity is an accommodation party regardless of whether that person received any compensation for so acting or did so gratuitously. Lewis v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 139 Ga. App. 855, 229 S.E.2d 765 (1976) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One signing name to instrument for purpose of lending credit to that of maker becomes an accommodation party, regardless of whether that person receives any compensation for so acting or does so gratuitously. Griswold v. Whetsell, 157 Ga. App. 800, 278 S.E.2d 753 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One who lends name to another party to a negotiable instrument in any capacity is an accommodation party regardless of whether that person received any compensation for so acting or did so gratuitously, and one cannot legally assert lack of consideration for accommodation since value received by principal debtor is consideration for which accommodation party bargained. Motz v. Landmark First Nat'l Bank, 154 Ga. App. 858, 270 S.E.2d 81 (1980); Callicott v. Reeves &amp; Wagner Constr. Co., 199 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One signing back of note, without more.</b> - One placing name on back of promissory note, without more, for purpose of lending credit to the instrument for accommodation of maker, is nevertheless an endorser, in the legal sense of the word, and is not a surety unless as between original parties that person is shown to be a surety by agreement. Massell v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 57 Ga. App. 460, 196 S.E. 115 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-604, 14-605, and 14-607).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Endorsement by maker under payee's endorsement.</b> - Where check was endorsed by payee, and maker then endorsed it under name of payee, in addition to liability on the check as maker, the latter was an accommodation endorser and therefore liable to all parties subsequent to payee on said check. Stewart v. Western Union Tel. Co., 83 Ga. App. 532, 64 S.E.2d 327 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-604 and 14-609).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Accommodation maker not relieved by payee's knowledge of accommodation.</b> - Knowledge of payee that one is signing promissory note as accommodation maker will not relieve such signatory from liability thereon.

<p class="p4"><b>Liability to party accommodated.</b> - Party for whose benefit accommodation paper has been made acquires no rights against accommodation party, who may set up want of consideration as a defense to action by accommodated party, since as between them there is no consideration, a fact which is always a defense to a suit on negotiable paper between immediate parties. One is not liable to party accommodated, although also signed for accommodation of another party, or although a comaker received value from party accommodated, or although the person signed for accommodation of two other parties and a valuable consideration passed between parties accommodated. McLendon v. Lane, 51 Ga. App. 409, 180 S.E. 746 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-306). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plain and unambiguous terms of note did not show accommodated party.</b> - Trial court did not err by granting summary judgment to a bank in its action against the obligor on three promissory notes because the clear and unambiguous terms of the notes did not show that there was an accommodated party as they simply identified the obligor as the obligated borrower.

<p class="p4"><b>Capacity of signer.</b> - Where there has been no negotiation of instrument, accommodation party may show by parol what understanding or agreement was as to the accommodating party's capacity in signing. Deems v. Wilson, 114 Ga. App. 341, 151 S.E.2d 230 (1966) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of accommodation admissible against one taking overdue instrument knowing no payments had been made.</b> - Because plaintiffs took instrument after it was due with knowledge that no payments had been made on it prior to that time, they were not holders in due course and oral proof concerning accommodation character of defendant's execution of note could be shown. Swida v. Adams, 138 Ga. App. 347, 226 S.E.2d 139 (1976) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment of note from proceeds of life insurance policy assigned by cosigner to creditor.</b> - The statutes and cases barring a cosigner from introducing parol evidence that the cosigner signed the note as a surety are applicable only when the defense of suretyship is asserted by one who is primarily obligated on the note in an action brought by the payee or payee's assign to collect on the note. That prohibition does not apply where the note was paid from the proceeds of a life insurance policy the cosigner had assigned to the creditor, the creditor assigned the note and security deed to the estate, the maker then sued the creditor and the cosigner's executor to cancel the security deed. Aultman v. United Bank, 259 Ga. 237, 378 S.E.2d 302 (1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-415).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Signature eliminating defense regarding breach of oral agreement.</b> - An accommodation party argued that the party should not be held liable on certain notes, because commercial loan officers of the bank breached an oral agreement not to make loans to the accommodated parties without that party's prior knowledge and consent. The accommodation party's signature on the notes sued on, the authenticity of which was not contested, eliminated this defense. Richards v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 199 Ga.

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by (i) the issuer or acceptor of the instrument; or (ii) a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In an action under subsection (a) of this Code section, the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Proof required for conversion of a check.</b> - Appellate court erred in reversing a trial court's grant of summary judgment pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56 to an auto dealership in a conversion action against a bank, which alleged that the bank deliberately cashed a check after the dealership had placed a stop payment on the check. The law applicable to conversion of personal property applied to instruments pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-420(a), and checks were one form of instrument included in this provision, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-104(c), (f); therefore, the dealership was not required to establish the existence of specific dollars or coins in order to recover for the conversion of its check and the full value of the intangible rights identified with that check. Decatur Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 276 Ga. 817, 583 S.E.2d 6 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trustee's withdrawal and improper use of trust funds.</b> - Fact that trustee withdrew and used trust funds for an improper purpose did not make trustee's endorsements for the withdrawals forged or unauthorized so as to make the bank liable for the withdrawals. Bank S. v. Grand Lodge of Free &amp; Accepted Masons, 174 Ga. App. 777, 331 S.E.2d 629 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Corporate officer's misuse of corporate account.</b> - Because a company's corporate resolution authorized one of its officers to make deposits to and withdrawals from an account maintained at a bank, and the officer, in the process of making deposits to the account, illegally took cash back from the deposits for personal use, the bank was not liable for conversion because the corporate resolution, as well as a signature card bearing the officer's signature, gave the officer authority to deal with the account. Atlanta Sand &amp; Supply Co. v. Citizens Bank, 276 Ga. App. 149, 622 S.E.2d 484 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Slight variance between payee and endorsement.</b> - A bank did not act in a commercially unreasonable manner when it accepted checks made payable to "Coulter Electronics, Inc." upon endorsements reading simply "Coulter Electronics". Coulter Elecs., Inc. v. Commercial Bank, 727 F.2d 1078 (11th Cir. 1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ratification of attorney's signature.</b> - If a bank customer, by the customer's own conduct, ratified attorney's unauthorized signature on a check, the customer's was precluded from recovering on a claim for conversion against the bank which accepted for deposit to the attorney's escrow account a check payable to the customer bearing an allegedly forged endorsement. Hendrix v. First Bank, 195 Ga. App. 510, 394 S.E.2d 134 (1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Preemption.</b> - Because the Georgia Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) explicitly defined when a plaintiff may recover in circumstances such as this, it would have undermined the statutory scheme to allow the plaintiff to circumvent the Georgia UCC's provisions by simultaneously litigating the same claims under two different legal standards; i.e., the common law and the Georgia UCC. Therefore, the district court properly held that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-420 preempted the plaintiff's common law conversion and negligence claims. Estate of Bass v. Regions Bank, Inc., 947 F.3d 1352 (11th Cir. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment precluded.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank and a credit union, on claims of conversion, civil conspiracy and for attorney fees and punitive damages, as: (1) no probative evidence existed that the buyer received delivery of the check, and thus, it never became a holder of the instrument at issue or entitled to enforce it; (2) no evidence was presented that the bank and credit union acted in concert against the buyer; (3) no evidence of misconduct or bad faith on the part of the bank or the credit union was presented; but, the trial court properly found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the bank and the credit union were holders in due course and whether the check bore evidence of forgery or alteration so as to call into question its authenticity. Hartsock v. Rich's Emples. Credit Union, 279 Ga. App. 724, 632 S.E.2d 476 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Measure of Damages</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liquidation of damages.</b> - Under subsection (2) of this section measure of liability is presumed to be face amount of instrument. Thus, plaintiff does not have election as to recovery, and amount of damages is liquidated. National Bank v. Refrigerated Transp. Co., 14 Ga. App. 240, 248 S.E.2d 496 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Blank payment checks were valueless.</b> - On cross-motions for summary judgment in a Fair Labor Standards Act case filed by plaintiff Mexican national agricultural laborers against defendant employers that included a claim for conversion of certain "reimbursement" checks in that the employers directed the laborers to endorse and return the checks, and the employers argued that it was entitled to the returned checks due to the employers paying for bus fares and subsistence and additional transportation expenses in cash, and also argued that the checks were blank, the court agreed with the employers that because the checks were blank, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-3-104(c) and 11-3-420(a), they were valueless, so there would be no damage from converting the checks. Morales-Arcadio v. Shannon Produce Farms, Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(S.D. Ga. July 18, 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment of check without joint payee's endorsement.</b> - Assuming paragraph (c) of subsection (1) does apply to missing endorsements, subsection (2) is not construed as providing a rule of absolute liability against the drawee bank for the face amount of a check where a payee who suffered no actual damage would be unjustly enriched; the measure of damages with respect to missing endorsements is one of actual damages. White County Bank v. Noland Co., 214 Ga. App. 780, 449 S.E.2d 325 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Credit for prior payment.</b> - A bank which was liable for conversion to the client of an attorney who deposited a forged check to the attorney's trust account was entitled to a credit against the face amount of the instrument for a prior payment made to the client from the trust account. Tifton Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Knight's Furn. Co., 215 Ga. App. 471, 452 S.E.2d 219 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

App. 240, 248 S.E.2d 496 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank's duty to inquire into validity of irregular endorsements.</b> - Where endorsements are irregular enough on their face to raise question as to their validity; and when checks are offered for deposit into account of one not payee, bank has duty to inquire to ascertain authority of depositor to endorse and deposit payee's checks, and cannot escape its duty of inquiry by relying on word of its customer, the depositor, nor does fact that bank could proceed against its customer under warranty provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-3-417 and 11-4-207 absolve it of obligation of inquiry. Failure to inquire into validity of such endorsements precludes a bank from asserting defense of commercial reasonableness of subsection (3) of this section as a matter of law. Thornton &amp; Co. v. Gwinnett Bank &amp; Trust Co., 151 Ga. App. 641, 260 S.E.2d 765 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where checks endorsed by and deposited into the account of an aluminum siding contractor were clearly made out to both a manufacturer and the contractor, the endorsements of both were required, and the bank's failure to examine the checks precluded their reliance on commercial reasonableness as a defense, as a matter of law; therefore, the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider the issue of commercial reasonableness as to checks which bore no endorsement by the manufacturer. Stolle Corp. v. McMahon, 195 Ga. App. 270, 393 S.E.2d 52 (1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit by a shopping center mortgagee seeking damages after the insurer paid the mortgagor insurance proceeds for damage to the premises by hail (and the mortgagor's agent fraudulently endorsed the check and left the country), the mortgagee was not entitled to summary judgment on the mortgagee's claims against the collecting bank and the drawee bank for failing to detect the irregular endorsement because genuine issues of fact remained as to whether the banks' conduct was commercially reasonable. Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Hale Haven Props., 346 Ga. App. 39, 815 S.E.2d 574 (2018), cert. denied, No. S18C1423, 2019 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Bank accepting check with "patently irregular endorsement"</b> does not comply with reasonable commercial standards, and fact that depositor of check is customer of the bank does not absolve bank of its duty to inquire. National Bank v. Refrigerated Transp. Co., 147 Ga. App. 240, 248 S.E.2d 496 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Deposit to attorney's trust account.</b> - A bank did not act in a commercially reasonable manner when it accepted for deposit to an attorney's trust account a check payable to a client and the attorney without inquiring whether the attorney was authorized to endorse the check and where there was evidence that the bank had encountered numerous other problems with the attorney; overruling John Bean Mfg. Co. v. Citizens Bank of Gainesville, 60 Ga. App. 616, 4 S.E.2d 924 (1939). Titus v. Commercial Bank, 214 Ga. App. 657, 448 S.E.2d 753 (1994); Tifton Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Knight's Furn.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Typewritten endorsement.</b> - Defense that bank acted in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards applicable to business of banking may not even be raised where endorsement is typewritten and therefore suspect on its face, and such acceptance by a bank cannot be shown to be commercially reasonable. National Bank v. Refrigerated Transp. Co., 147 Ga. App. 240, 248 S.E.2d 496 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Checks payable to corporation, endorsed in blank, presented by third party.</b> - Since checks payable to a corporation are not normally endorsed in blank by corporate officers and delivered to third parties, a collecting bank should inquire as to reason and authority for deposit in third party's account. National Bank v. Refrigerated Transp. Co., 147 Ga. App. 240, 248 S.E.2d 496 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Bank's allowing customer's employee to withdraw customer's funds</b> was not commercially reasonable conduct, where bank which was not authorized to pay a check drawn against any funds deposited to the customer's credit unless the check contained two authorized signatures, paid funds out of unauthorized customer accounts on the employee's single signature. APCOA, Inc. v. Fidelity Nat'l Bank, 703 F. Supp. 1553 (N.D.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question for jury.</b> - Whether bank's acceptance of checks made payable to a motel for deposit into the motel manager's personal account was consistent with reasonable commercial standards was a question for the jury, where the motel's customary rubberstamped restrictive indorsement was missing. Trust Co. Bank v. Henderson, 185 Ga. App. 367, 364 S.E.2d 289 (1987), aff'd, 258 Ga. 703, 373 S.E.2d 738 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-419).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of blank-endorsed cashier's checks.</b> - Bank was properly granted summary judgment in a suit filed against it by a law firm for negligently accepting stolen checks and for conversion with regards to blank-endorsed cashier's checks, as such were bearer paper transferable by possession alone; however, because a fact issue remained as to whether it acted in good faith in accepting forged checks, it could not be a holder in due course, and summary judgment was improper.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Necessity of presentment for payment and notice of dishonor.</b> - According to rules of common law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, the endorser of a promissory note is entitled to have the same duly presented for payment, and of a failure or refusal to pay the endorser is entitled to notice; and a failure of the holder to present for payment, or to give notice of nonpayment, discharges the endorser from liability. McCarroll v. First Inv. Co., 109 Ga. App. 748, 137 S.E.2d 319 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-701 and 14-801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When presentment and notice of dishonor not required.</b> - The law does not require that notice of presentment and dishonor of a negotiable instrument be given to an endorser in order to charge the endorser with liability, where the endorser already has knowledge of such matters. The law does not require a useless thing. McCarroll v. First Inv. Co., 109 Ga. App. 748, 137 S.E.2d 319 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-701 and 14-801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contents of petition against endorser.</b> - To bind the endorser as such on notes endorsed after maturity, there had to be a presentment for payment and notice of dishonor upon nonpayment, and before endorsee could proceed against endorser on the instrument, petition must have set forth compliance with these prerequisites to liability. DeLoach v. Adams Loan &amp; Inv. Co., 62 Ga. App. 61, 7 S.E.2d 580 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 14-701 and 14-801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Retention of check for unreasonable time constituting an acceptance.</b> - Retention of check for unreasonable time without cashing and without indicating refusal to accept it as an accord and satisfaction constitutes acceptance. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of check for unreasonable period may work accord and satisfaction.</b> - If one intends to accept a check as payment of demand, it should be promptly presented for payment, usually within a 30-day period. Where, in absence of circumstances suggesting a contrary state of facts, the check, although not cashed, is kept for a period greatly in excess of this time, such retention may of itself cause the debtor to rely on theory that his offer (accord) has been accepted (satisfaction), in which case the creditor no longer has a right of action for any excess payment due. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of check with knowledge of refused acceptance.</b> - Mere retention of stale check, with knowledge on part of debtor that creditor refused to accept it in full satisfaction of unliquidated liability, will not operate as an accord and satisfaction. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Pre-Code rule affirmed.</b> - Only holder or holder's agent may properly present check for payment.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of former subsection (3).</b> - Former Code section <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-208 and former subsection (3) of this section intended to eliminate circuity in order of responsibility of endorsers of check. Columbian Peanut Co. v. Frosteg, 472 F.2d 476 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 824, 94 S. Ct. 126, 38 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discharge on Underlying Contract</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure of consideration on note liability.</b> - Former subsection (2) of this section codifies principle that failure of consideration on underlying contract discharges liability on note. Hunter v. McLelland, 143 Ga. App. 746, 240 S.E.2d 153 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recognition of interdependence of promises to deliver possession and pay.</b> - Promise of seller to deliver possession and comply with other terms of contract are interdependent with promise of buyer to pay for the property. Neither buyer nor seller is obligated to perform unless the other is ready and able to perform his or her obligations under the contract. Hunter v. McLelland, 143 Ga. App. 746, 240 S.E.2d 153 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of vendor's failure to deliver title according to contract.</b> - Inability of vendor of land to make title according to vendor's contract will give vendee a cause of action for breach of contract and justify vendee in asserting want or failure of consideration as to any notes executed therefor in hands of a holder with notice. Hunter v. McLelland, 143 Ga. App. 746, 240 S.E.2d 153 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Increased rate of interest.</b> - The comaker of the third series of renewal notes was discharged following subsequent renewals at an increased rate of interest, where the provisions of the note did not cover subsequent modifications of the interest rate and the comaker had not signed the subsequent notes. Bank of Terrell v. Webb, 177 Ga. App. 715, 341 S.E.2d 258 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discharge of Surety</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section governs surety's discharge on a note.</b> - Surety's discharge on a note is now governed by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-601 which lists various circumstances in which a party may be discharged from liability on an instrument. DeKalb County Bank v. Haldi, 146 Ga. App. 257, 246 S.E.2d 116 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Section 10-7-22 was superseded by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-902, which was, in turn, repealed by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-10-103. Law governing discharge of sureties and other parties on instruments is currently governed by Uniform Commercial Code provisions cited in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-601. Christian v. Atlanta Army Depot Fed. Credit Union, 151 Ga. App. 403, 260 S.E.2d 533 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relationship to O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 10 (suretyship chapter).</b> - There is no conflict between application of O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 10 and holding that commercial paper chapter of Uniform Commercial Code controls in cases based on negotiable instruments, since O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-601, which provided for discharge of parties to negotiable instruments, in former subsection (2) provided for such use of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> Ch. 7, T. 10. Import of that subsection was that in situations other than those listed in former subsection (1) of this section, the law providing for discharge of surety or guarantor of simple contract for payment of money applies equally to surety or guarantor of negotiable instruments. Consequently, an agreement (novation) which would discharge surety or guarantor of simple contract for payment of money will also discharge one who is guarantor or surety on negotiable instrument. Sewell v. Akins, 147 Ga. App. 454, 249 S.E.2d 274 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Some decisions have applied O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 10 to contracts of surety or guaranty securing obligations evidenced by instruments which were almost certainly negotiable instruments without reference to the Uniform Commercial Code. Sewell v. Akins, 147 Ga. App. 454, 249 S.E.2d 274 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of discharge of principal debtor.</b> - Whenever principal debtor is discharged, surety is also discharged. Samples v. Kamp-N-Go Sys., Inc., 139 Ga. App. 324, 228 S.E.2d 360 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Stop payment order does not relieve drawer of liability to holder.</b> - While drawer of check has the right to stop payment of it at any time before certification or payment by drawee, drawer remains liable, unless drawer has a defense good against the holder. Tidwell v. Bank of Tifton, 115 Ga. App. 555, 155 S.E.2d 451 (1967) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of note does not relieve maker.</b> - The sale of a note, although it may provide the seller with sufficient funds to cover the debt, does not discharge the maker's obligation to pay the note according to its terms. First State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. McIver, 893 F.2d 301 (11th Cir. 1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment over forged endorsement not protection against true owner.</b> - Payment of promissory note to supposed transferee, holding it by virtue of forged endorsement, will not protect maker or one who has assumed the debt, against payment to true owner; and, consequently, in suit by such alleged transferee to enforce liability against such parties, assumer may utilize defense that alleged transfer by payee was not genuine. Austell Bank v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 757, 4 S.E.2d 913 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-223).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inquiry into plaintiff's title.</b> - In a suit instituted by a person claiming to be the owner and holder of a promissory note, for the purpose of recovering thereon against the maker and another person alleged to have assumed the debt, it is permissible for the latter to inquire into the plaintiff's title to the note, if necessary either for the other's protection or to let in any valid defense which that person seeks to make.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiffs could not assert claim based on instruments to which plaintiffs were not parties or third-party beneficiaries.</b> - Plaintiffs' claim that the defendant violated the "one satisfaction rule" by foreclosing on the plaintiffs' home failed because the plaintiffs could not assert a claim against the defendant based on a purported insurance policy or settlement agreement as the plaintiffs were not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, those instruments. Fenello v. Bank of Am., N.A.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Pooling of mortgage loan argument failed.</b> - In a case arising from a foreclosure, a pro se borrower's argument that the underlying debt had been paid was meritless. The pooling of the mortgage loan into a securitized trust did not absolve the borrower from having to make loan payments or somehow shield the borrower's property from foreclosure. Morrison v.

<p class="p4"><b>Bankruptcy.</b> - In a case arising from a foreclosure, a pro se borrower's argument that the underlying debt had been paid was meritless. While the borrower was granted a bankruptcy discharge, it was axiomatic that a discharge in bankruptcy extinguished only the borrower's personal liability of the debtor, and a creditor's right to foreclose on the property secured by the loan survived or passed through the bankruptcy.

<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discharge, under Code Section 11-3-604, of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the discharged party. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension discharges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the extent the indorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse. The loss suffered by the indorser or accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is secured by an interest in collateral and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent (i) the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse of the party asserting discharge; or (ii) the reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the interest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

If the party asserting discharge is an accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection (e) of this Code section, the party is deemed to have a right to contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a right to reimbursement.

<p class="p4"><b>The discharge under O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-3-605 is only pro tanto</b> and releases the surety only to the extent that the surety proves the impairment. To the extent that Melton v. J.M. Kenith Co., 182 Ga. App. 184, 355 S.E.2d 115 (1987), is contra, it is overruled. Bank S. v. Jones, 185 Ga. App. 125, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1987), cert. denied, 185 Ga. App. 909, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Availability of suretyship defenses.</b> - The suretyship defenses provided in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-605 are not limited to parties who are "secondarily liable," but are available to any party who is in the position of a surety, having a right of recourse either on the instrument or dehors it, including accommodation maker or acceptor known to the holder to be so. Bank S. v. Jones, 185 Ga. App. 125, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1987), cert. denied, 185 Ga. App. 909, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Not applicable to liability of debtor to guarantor.</b> - This section and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-7-22 address liability of a guarantor to a creditor, not the liability for a debtor to his guarantor, and did not apply to the release of a guarantor's principal from liability on a note. Fabian v. Dykes, 214 Ga. App. 792, 449 S.E.2d 305 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-606).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provision authorizing release may operate as waiver.</b> - Where guarantee agreement provided that bank was authorized to release collateral or substitute collateral without any notice to guarantors without affecting liability of undersigned, such release operates as a waiver of consenting parties' right to claim their own discharge.

<p class="p4"><b>Discharge by grant of extension by creditor.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-605 does not expressly state that if creditor grants extension, surety is discharged, but draftsmen intended that result. A surety, then, can claim discharge under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-605 when, without consent and without an "express reservation of rights," creditor and debtor enter into binding agreement to extend time for payment.

<p class="p4"><b>Elements of showing failure to use proper diligence to collect.</b> - Where contention is that holder of promissory notes as collateral security failed to use proper diligence to collect them, it is necessary to show both that failure to collect was due to negligence of holder of collateral, and that damage accrued to other party therefrom. Hurt v. Citizens Trust Co., 128 Ga. App. 224, 196 S.E.2d 349 (1973); Mitchell v. Ringson, 169 Ga. App. 88, 311 S.E.2d 516 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Release of coguarantor with limited liability.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-3-605 was inapplicable to appellees, coguarantors of note, where, although note in question was jointly guaranteed, each guarantor had specifically limited liability thereon to guarantor's own interest; thus, there could be no injury to appellees by the release of a coguarantor.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proving impairment.</b> - Failure to collect on collateral, without more, not sufficient to show "impairment" thereof. Hurt v. Citizens Trust Co., 128 Ga. App. 224, 196 S.E.2d 349 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof.</b> - With the defense of impairment of collateral under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) (now (e)) of this section, the burden of proof is on the party claiming the defense, and that party must prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. Doyal v. Thornton, 205 Ga. App. 74, 421 S.E.2d 314 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Test for unjustifiable impairment of collateral</b> not in the creditor's possession is whether the creditor exercised reasonable care considering the circumstances of the case.

App. 125, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1987), cert. denied, 185 Ga. App. 909, 364 S.E.2d 281 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Where a creditor transferred possession of some collateral to a codebtor,</b> and express language of a guaranty agreement prevented the surety from subrogation until the creditor received full payment of all liabilities, the surety could not be discharged on the claim that rights to subrogation had been impaired.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impairment of collateral defense rejected.</b> - Where a promissory note provided that the bank could "release any security . . . without affecting [defendants'] obligation to pay the loan," it was apparent that defendants consented in advance to an impairment of collateral by the bank. Consequently, they were estopped to assert the defense of impairment of collateral. H &amp; H Operations, Inc. v. West Ga. Nat'l Bank, 181 Ga. App. 766, 353 S.E.2d 633 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A commercial loan officer's testimony that accommodated party had sold some business fixtures and brought the proceeds of the sale to the bank, which applied them toward her business loans, was insufficient to show an "impairment of collateral" within the meaning of subsection (1)(b) (now (e)). Richards v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 199 Ga. App. 636, 405 S.E.2d 705, cert. denied, 199 Ga. App. 907, 405 S.E.2d 705 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even if the obligors were accommodation parties who signed two promissory notes that went into default, a point they argued without factual support, the modification agreements signed by the other people did not release them from their obligations under the notes as the obligors did not show that the agreement to extend the due date of the instrument at issue caused loss to them with respect to the right of recourse or that the value of the collateral had been impaired.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action pursuant to general banking usage as exercise of ordinary care.</b> - The fact that a bank did not verify signatures on forged checks following a change in its rule on verification was sufficient to raise a factual issue as to its exercise of ordinary care, and, even if it showed conclusively that it complied with local industry standards, that simply shifted the burden to the bank's customer to produce rebuttal evidence that the bank did not exercise ordinary care.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party subject to limitation on damages.</b> - The drawer of a check made payable to a third party was deemed to have used the instrument in contemplation of its presentment for payment upon the action of a collecting bank and, thus, was engaged in a transaction governed by the UCC subject to the damage limitation provision of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-103.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Shortening of notice period.</b> - The trial court properly upheld an agreement between a customer and a bank under which the bank could not be charged with liability for negligence because the customer had not notified the bank of disputed checks within 30 days; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-103(a), parties by agreement could change the 60-day notice period allowed for in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406(f), and such an agreement was controlling unless it was manifestly unreasonable, which was not the case here, and shortening the time period did not excuse the bank from its duty of ordinary care or disclaim the bank's liability for negligence in the future inasmuch as the notice period started over again each time the bank sent a new statement to the customer.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the issues dealt with under the provisions, certain decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502 are included in the annotations for this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Primary purpose of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>11-4-201 seems to be to avoid litigation over question of status of collecting banks, i.e., as owners or agents for collection, and to make any settlements given by them to owner of instruments provisional until they have received final settlement for the instruments. By making settlement provisional, this section causes risk of loss to continue in owner of item rather than in agent bank. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 110 Ga. App. 319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The collecting bank is merely an agent of the drawer</b> of a draft. Wallace v. Harrison, 166 Ga. App. 461, 304 S.E.2d 487 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank's right to sue drawer in own name in spite of presumption of agency.</b> - Fact that presumption of plaintiff-depositary bank's agency of payee-depositor for collection purposes continues even after credit given depositor has been withdrawn does not negative right of bank to bring action in its own name against defendant-drawer. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 110 Ga. App. 319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Depositary bank as holder in due course.</b> - Where plaintiff bank is unable to obtain settlement, either final or provisional, from payor bank by reason of stop payment order of defendant-drawer, it becomes holder in due course (all pertinent requirements having been met) with a security interest in the item which enables it to enforce payment against drawer, with right of charge-back against its depositor's account in event that judgment cannot be obtained against drawer. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 110 Ga. App. 319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where check is deposited and credited to depositor's account and depositor is allowed to draw against it, the bank is presumed to be holder in due course in spite of express conditions in deposit contract making bank a mere agent for collection, where there are other facts; namely, that draft was endorsed in blank and bank thereafter paid checks drawn by endorser against such deposit, making bank at least a pledgee, if not absolute owner of the draft, and placing it on same footing as a purchaser. Southern Fruit Distribs., Inc. v. Citizens' Bank, 44 Ga. App. 832, 163 S.E. 261 (1932); Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, 99 Ga. App. 598, 109 S.E.2d 620 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of collection agreement.</b> - Collection agreement is simply a device for bank and depositor to determine respective rights between themselves, not such a contract as will conclusively and in all events determine status of paper so far as third parties are concerned. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, 99 Ga. App. 598, 109 S.E.2d 620 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While deposit to credit of depositor under collection agreement gives rise to presumption of agency relationship rather than debtor-creditor relationship, and while, between parties themselves, the bank may always charge back uncollected check against its depositor whether it has advanced funds thereon or not, nevertheless, the presumption of agency relationship, so far as third parties are concerned, holds only so long as no contrary agreement between bank and depositor is shown. Proof that bank did in fact not only credit fund to depositor but allowed the depositor to draw against that credit is, according to better rule, conclusive evidence of a contrary agreement. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, 99 Ga. App. 598, 109 S.E.2d 620 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a bank credited depositors' accounts and permitted them to withdraw funds prior to their collection, and they did in fact withdraw funds, the bank became a holder in due course as to the amounts withdrawn so as to be able to enforce payment of the amounts. Howell v. Bank of Newman (In re Summit Fin. Servs., Inc.), 240 Bankr. 105 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Endorsement no basis for drawer's recovery against bank.</b> - Endorsement on check reading, "Pay to Any Bank, Banker or Trust Company. All Prior Endorsements Guaranteed," runs only to a bank, banker, or trust company, and drawer cannot base its right to recover from the bank on guarantee contained in the endorsement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where bank credits deposit and allows withdrawals, it is holder in due course.</b> - Where check is deposited and credited to depositor's account and depositor is allowed to draw against it, the bank is presumed to be holder in due course in spite of express conditions in deposit contract making bank a mere agent for collection, where there are other facts, namely, that draft was endorsed in blank and bank thereafter paid checks drawn by endorser against such deposit, making bank at least a pledgee, if not absolute owner of the draft, and placing it on same footing as a purchaser. Southern Fruit Distribs., Inc. v. Citizens' Bank, 44 Ga. App. 832, 163 S.E. 261 (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502); Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, 99 Ga. App. 598, 109 S.E.2d 620 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">No matter what the deposit agreement was initially, when bank did in fact credit deposit to its customer, and thereafter permitted customer to withdraw fund before collection, the bank became a holder for value of the check as to amount withdrawn, so as to be able to enforce payment against drawer thereof. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, 99 Ga. App. 598, 109 S.E.2d 620 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Instrument lacking joint payee's endorsement.</b> - A bank never became a holder in due course where a check made payable jointly to the bank's customer and a third party was never endorsed by the third party before deposit in the bank. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Sun Belt Elec. Constructors, Inc., 64 Bankr. 377 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of collection agreement.</b> - Collection agreement is simply a device for bank and depositor to determine respective rights between themselves, not such a contract as will conclusively and in all events determine status of paper so far as third parties are concerned. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, 99 Ga. App. 598, 109 S.E.2d 620 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While deposit to credit of depositor under collection agreement gives rise to presumption of agency relationship rather than debtor-creditor relationship, and while, between parties themselves, the bank may always charge back uncollected check against its depositor whether it has advanced funds thereon or not, nevertheless, the presumption of agency relationship, so far as third parties are concerned, holds only so long as no contrary agreement between bank and depositor is shown. Proof that bank did in fact not only credit fund to depositor but allowed depositor to draw against that credit is, according to better rule, conclusive evidence of a contrary agreement. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, 99 Ga. App. 598, 109 S.E.2d 620 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 14-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Right to charge back credit.</b> - A bank has the right to revoke the credit it has extended when it is unable to collect the check upon which it has extended the provisional credit. The fact that the customer has used a portion of the credit extended does not affect the bank's right to charge back the credit, even though the bank was negligent in its representation that the deposited check was "good." However, the elements of estoppel prevent the bank from obtaining a refund of the amount credited to the account. First Ga. Bank v. Webster, 168 Ga. App. 307, 308 S.E.2d 579 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where plaintiff bank is unable to obtain settlement, either final or provisional, from payor bank by reason of stop payment order of defendant-drawer, it becomes a holder in due course (all pertinent requirements having been met) with a security interest in the item which enables it to enforce payment against drawer, with right of charge back against its depositor's account in event that judgment cannot be obtained against drawer. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 110 Ga. App. 319, 138 S.E.2d 442 (1964). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bank's deposit agreement with the bank's customer was not unreasonable and permitted the bank to charge back to the customer's account the amount of a check upon the check's return from another bank as fraudulent, although the bank had provided provisional funds that the customer had withdrawn or paid out. Vadde v. Bank of Am., 301 Ga. App. 475, 687 S.E.2d 880 (2009), cert. denied, No. S10C0624, 2010 Ga. LEXIS 338 (Ga. 2010); cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 298, 178 L.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Depositor's duty to minimize damages.</b> - A bank is liable for damages proximately caused by its wrongful handling of an item, but depositor has obligation to exercise reasonable care to rectify situation and minimize the damage done. If depositor fails in own obligations once depositor has notice, depositor is precluded from recovery against the bank. Donmoyer v. Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co., 151 Ga. App. 38, 258 S.E.2d 725 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>President of corporate depositor held not "customer" of bank.</b> - Corporation president, who was one of four shareholders who guaranteed the corporation's debt to a bank, which viewed the corporation as its depositor, was not a "customer" of the bank and could not maintain an action against the bank for wrongful dishonor. Thrash v. Georgia State Bank, 189 Ga. App. 21, 375 S.E.2d 112 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of general deposit.</b> - Deposit of money in bank on general deposit creates relationship of creditor and debtor between bank and depositor and debtor bank can discharge its liability only by paying money to depositor, or as directed by depositor, and cannot discharge its liability by accepting and paying forged checks drawn in name of depositor against the bank. White v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 71 Ga. App. 78, 30 S.E.2d 118 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Drawer's knowledge of insufficient funds.</b> - In an action by the drawer of a check against a bank for damages arising from drawer's arrest and prosecution for issuing a bad check based on the bank's negligent failure to stop payment and wrongful dishonor of the check, evidence that the drawer knew the check would not be honored was sufficient probable cause for the arrest and prosecution and, thus, the bank could not be held accountable for such damages. Karrer v. Georgia State Bank, 215 Ga. App. 654, 452 S.E.2d 120 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Drawee bank bears loss for payment of forged check.</b> - A bank is bound to know signatures of its customers, and it cannot legally charge an amount paid on forged check to account of depositor whose name was forged, but must be considered as having made payment from its own funds. White v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 71 Ga. App. 78, 30 S.E.2d 118 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof.</b> - On motion for summary judgment, where a bank customer introduced proof by affidavit that the payee of a wrongfully dishonored check would not have accepted any untimely tender of the amount owed after the check was dishonored, the bank had the burden of establishing as a matter of law that the damages the customer suffered were not the result of the bank's wrongful dishonor of the check. Malak v. First Nat'l Bank, 195 Ga. App. 105, 393 S.E.2d 267 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to stop payment.</b> - The law fully accords the drawer of an uncertified check the right to order the bank to stop payment, and stopping payment on a check, especially to recoup monies owed, does not constitute extreme and outrageous conduct. UPS v. Moore, 238 Ga. App. 376, 519 S.E.2d 15 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Rights of bank carrying account with other bank.</b> - Bank carrying account with another bank has right to stop payment on its check, which would, however, still leave it liable for value of the item unless some legal and valid defense is available to it.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rights of holders in due course.</b> - Since bank is agent of maker, the latter is entitled as a matter of right to stop payment of any check drawn by maker on such bank any time before it is presented to bank for payment. This right cannot be exercised by maker in way and manner that would prejudice rights of holders in due course of check in question without becoming liable on instrument to such holders, however when this right is exercised by giving notice to drawee bank by means of telegraph service, telegraph company becomes liable for any damages sustained by inexcusable failure on its part to make proper delivery of the telegram.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Public policy evidenced by this section.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406 evidences public policy in favor of imposing upon customers the duty of prompt examination of their bank statements and notification to banks of forgeries and alterations and in favor of reasonable time limitations on responsibility of banks for payment of forged or altered items. Trust Co. Bank v. Atlanta IBM Employees Fed. Credit Union, 245 Ga. 262, 264 S.E.2d 202 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank's liability prior to section's enactment.</b> - Before former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044, liability of bank was absolute, but with enactment of <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044 a duty was placed on all depositors to notify bank within given period of time of forged checks being charged against depositors' accounts. G. Franklyn Fischer &amp; Assocs. v. First Nat'l Bank, 102 Ga. App. 567, 116 S.E.2d 902 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section is punitive in nature and must be strictly construed.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044, is punitive in nature, penalizing depositor by depriving depositor of right, which depositor would otherwise have against the bank, to repudiate a forged check, and must be strictly construed. White v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 71 Ga. App. 78, 30 S.E.2d 118 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

App. 253, 257 S.E.2d 346 (1979), rev'd on other grounds, 245 Ga. 264, 264 S.E.2d 202 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time limits where bank fails to act in good faith.</b> - In absence of good faith by the bank, which ordinarily is an issue for jury consideration, depositor does not forfeit right of recovery by failing to give notice within prescribed time.

<p class="p4"><b>Absence of good faith is not necessarily synonymous with negligence,</b> and subsection (4) (now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406(f)) expressly eliminates negligence as an issue on items not within time covered by customer's notice.

<p class="p4"><b>Duty of depositor to minimize damages.</b> - A bank is liable for damages proximately caused by its wrongful handling of an item, but depositor has obligation to exercise reasonable care to rectify situation and minimize the damage done. If depositor fails in personal obligations once depositor has notice, the depositor is precluded from recovery against the bank. Donmoyer v. Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co., 151 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Bank actions in failing to inform customers</b> of a rule change on signature verification, allowing an employee of customer to place funds in a checking account from the customer's line of credit, and arranging personal loans for the employee were not evidence of a lack of good faith on the part of the bank in paying forged checks.

<p class="p4"><b>Comparison with previous Code.</b> - There is no substantial difference in intent and purpose between Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044 and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406 in imposing upon depositor the duty of notifying bank of unauthorized signatures or alterations within specified time limits, and decisions under former law are applicable to provide guides as to what may constitute a jury question of whether depositor is to be excused from this duty. Bank of Thomas County v. Dekle, 119 Ga. App. 753, 168 S.E.2d 834 (1969), overruled on other grounds, Decatur Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Litsky, 207 Ga. App. 752, 429 S.E.2d 300 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of subsection (f).</b> - Subsection (4) (now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406(f)) is limited to two types of claims by a customer: (1) unauthorized signature and (2) any alteration. Georgia Motor Club, Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 137 Ga. App. 521, 224 S.E.2d 498, overruled on other grounds, Marietta Yamaha, Inc. v. Thomas, 237 Ga. 840, 229 S.E.2d 753 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under the pre-July 1, 1996 version of this section, where the bank sent monthly statements including canceled checks or imaged copies of checks and made all items available to the customer, the customer's unauthorized payment claim was limited to those forged checks which it discovered and reported within the 60-day limit of paragraph (4) (now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406(f)). Summit Transp. Servs., Inc. v. NationsBank, 232 Ga. App. 8, 500 S.E.2d 911 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On plaintiff commercial checking account customer's suit against defendant, its employee embezzler's depository bank, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406's notice requirements applied to the embezzler's depository bank and the depository bank was not liable for the forged checks paid more than 60 days before the customer reported the forgeries to its payor bank. Ownbey Enters. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 457 F. Supp. 2d 1341 (N.D. Ga. 2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Customer's duties as to reporting discrepancies.</b> - As to items paid in good faith by a bank, the depositor must discover and report discrepancies to the bank within times prescribed by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406 after bank furnishes or in a reasonable manner affords depositor an opportunity to examine items supporting debits to the account, or else show, at least by proof sufficient to create a jury issue, why depositor failed to notify the bank. Bank of Thomas County v. Dekle, 119 Ga. App. 753, 168 S.E.2d 834 (1969), overruled on other grounds, Decatur Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Litsky, 207 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Shortening of notice period by agreement.</b> - The trial court properly upheld an agreement between a customer and a bank under which the bank could not be charged with liability for negligence because the customer had not notified the bank of disputed checks within 30 days; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-103(a), parties by agreement could change the 60-day notice period allowed for in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406(f), and such an agreement was controlling unless it was manifestly unreasonable, which was not the case here, and shortening the time period did not excuse the bank from its duty of ordinary care or disclaim the bank's liability for negligence in the future inasmuch as the notice period started over again each time the bank sent a new statement to the customer. Freese v. Regions Bank, N.A., 284 Ga. App. 717, 644 S.E.2d 549 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1190, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 691 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of customer negligence.</b> - Under the pre-July 1, 1996 version of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-4-406, the trial court erred in holding that the customer's alleged negligence was relevant under former paragraph (2), because a bank could not insulate itself from liability if the customer established lack of ordinary care on the part of the bank in paying items. Summit Transp. Servs., Inc. v. NationsBank, 232 Ga. App. 8, 500 S.E.2d 911 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absence of timely notice is absolute protection to bank.</b> - Even if bank is negligent in paying in good faith an item not covered by customer's notice of unauthorized signatures or alterations, and even if depositor is negligent in not preventing or in failing to discover the payment, absence of timely notice is absolute in protecting bank and excluding any right of recovery by depositor. Bank of Thomas County v. Dekle, 119 Ga. App. 753, 168 S.E.2d 834 (1969), overruled on other grounds, Decatur Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Litsky, 207 Ga.

Bank of Thomas County v. Dekle, 119 Ga. App. 753, 168 S.E.2d 834 (1969), overruled on other grounds, Decatur Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Litsky, 207 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Application of subsection (4) (now O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-4-406(f)) where forgeries on front and back.</b> - The rationale for allowing the drawer more time to report an unauthorized indorsement than an unauthorized signature is that there is little excuse for a customer not detecting an alteration of the customer's own check or a forgery of the customer's own signature. However, the customer does not know the signatures of indorsers and may be delayed in learning that indorsements are forged. Where both are present, the customer should discover and report the unauthorized payment within the shorter time period. Decatur Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Litsky, 207 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Good faith by bank as prerequisite to notice.</b> - There are circumstances wherein notice referred to in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044, need not be given, and it is only when a bank has in good faith paid a forged check that it is entitled to such notice.

<p class="p4">Before bank is entitled to notice prescribed by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044, it must appear that bank in good faith paid and charged to depositor's account money on a forged or raised check.

<p class="p4"><b>Two circumstances where notice requirement of section inapplicable.</b> - There are two circumstances where notice requirement of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044, is not a prerequisite to recovery: (1) where bank has not paid forged or raised check out of depositor's account in good faith, and (2) where depositor for other sufficient reason is relieved from giving such notice.

<p class="p4"><b>Forgeries committed and concealed by depositor's agent.</b> - Fact that forgeries were committed and concealed by one whom depositor entrusted to examine depositor statements and vouchers was not sufficient to excuse depositor from giving notice to the bank.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of timeliness of suit.</b> - Bank's claim that plaintiff was estopped from asserting that bank had improperly collected and deposited check with a missing endorsement was not meritorious in that suit had been filed against the bank within one year from the time of the making of the checks involved.

<p class="p4"><b>Whether facts excuse depositor's failure to give notice is jury issue.</b> - It is jury issue to determine whether or not facts pleaded are such as to absolve depositor from penalty prescribed by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044 (loss of funds paid by bank on forged check) for failure to give 60-day notice provided for therein.

<p class="p4"><b>Jury question whether notice excused and whether bank paid in good faith.</b> - Under petition alleging that all of the defendants including the bank acted jointly in withdrawing money, that signature on check was mere scrawl and was not signature of depositor, that it was the only check drawn against the account in nearly 11 years, and that there was notation on the check which it was alleged showed that suspicions of bank were aroused, it was question for jury to determine whether or not plaintiff was or should have been excused from giving notice under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2044, and whether bank acted in good faith in cashing forged check.

If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

In either case the claimant may also recover incidental damages but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant's recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided.

<p class="p4"><b>Article derogates common law, and one's right to alienate one's own property without restriction</b> and is therefore to be strictly construed. Yancey v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of article.</b> - Purpose of this article is not to eliminate remedy of original seller, but rather to protect seller on contractual indebtedness assumed to have been made at least partly on implication of solvency of purchaser arising from ownership of inventory of a going business. McClain v. Laurens Glass Co., 127 Ga. App. 316, 193 S.E.2d 194 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Central purpose underlying Art. 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code is to deal with type of commercial fraud in which merchant debtor sells stock and trade to another, pockets the proceeds, and then absconds, leaving the merchant's creditors unpaid. Johnson v. Vincent Brass &amp; Aluminum Co., 244 Ga. 412, 260 S.E.2d 325 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purpose of article is to protect creditors against fraudulent sales by debtors. W.W. Stovall Co. v. W.E. Shepherd Co., 10 Ga. App. 498, 73 S.E. 761 (1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3226). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purpose of article is to permit seller's creditors to subject consideration of proposed sale to garnishment before buyer disburses funds of such sale. McLean v. G.T. Duke Co., 95 Ga. App. 135, 97 S.E.2d 537 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This article is for protection of creditors existing at time of sale, who are to be notified, and in absence of fraud such sale cannot be attacked by subsequent creditors for noncompliance with this article. Dodd v. Raines, 1 F.2d 658 (N.D. Ga. 1924) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3226).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This article creates right in creditor not known at common law.</b> - In imposing obligation upon third party buyer (transferee) and allowing cause of action against that party for breach of obligation, the article creates right in creditor not known at common law. Indon Indus., Inc. v. Charles S. Martin Distrib. Co., 234 Ga. 845, 218 S.E.2d 562 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Article require's transferee to help in creditor protection.</b> - The effect of this article is to require transferee to help in creditor protection, principally a matter of giving notice, if transferee wants to ensure that they cannot reach goods in transferee's hands after transferee has paid for them. McClain v. Laurens Glass Co., 127 Ga. App. 316, 193 S.E.2d 194 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No distinction between creditors on basis of source of debt owed to them.</b> - This article draws no distinction between those creditors whose debts may have arisen from sale of merchandise and such creditors as sustain that relation by reason of indebtedness created by debtor for other independent and disassociated reasons. It applies as well to a sale of a stock of goods in bulk by a debtor to a creditor in extinguishment of debtor's debt as to a sale for cash or on credit. Anderson v. Merchants &amp; Miners State Bank, 161 Ga. 12, 129 S.E. 650 (1925) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3226).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Levying upon property for which title has been transferred.</b> - This article does not inhibit creditors, where statute has been complied with, from obtaining judgment against original purchaser who received goods and contracted with supplier to pay for them; compliance with its provisions merely prevents creditors, after judgment, from levying on property, title to which has passed out of judgment debtor's hands. McClain v. Laurens Glass Co., 127 Ga. App. 316, 193 S.E.2d 194 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remedies</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compliance by transferee necessary for protection.</b> - Unless transferee complies with requirements of this article, creditors may pursue goods as though they still belonged to transferor. McClain v. Laurens Glass Co., 127 Ga. App. 316, 193 S.E.2d 194 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense of payment directly to defendant's other creditors.</b> - Where article has not been complied with, it is no defense that purchase price of property was paid by purchaser directly to another of defendant's creditors. McLean v. G.T. Duke Co., 95 Ga. App. 135, 97 S.E.2d 537 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of noncompliance on transferred inventory.</b> - Noncompliance with this article subjects inventory transferred to attachment within 12-month statute of limitation. Willson v. Johnson Stores, Inc., 139 Ga. App. 308, 228 S.E.2d 340 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract action on open account against transferee not available remedy.</b> - Inasmuch as transfers in violation of this article are ineffective to pass title of goods from transferor to transferee, remedies available to original seller are those seller would have had against transferor, and contract action on open account against transferee is not such a remedy. American Express Co. v. Bomar Shoe Co., 125 Ga. App. 408, 187 S.E.2d 922 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Only in rem actions permitted.</b> - This article permits only in rem action against transferred goods or proceeds therefrom, not in personam action against transferee. American Express Co. v. Bomar Shoe Co., 127 Ga. App. 837, 195 S.E.2d 479 (1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The Bulk Transfer Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-6-101 et seq., preserves a creditor's remedy against the goods, not against the transferee personally, and permits a creditor to pursue goods in the hands of a transferee as though they still belonged to the transferor. Consequently, this act does not authorize a direct action for negligence against the transferee of corporate stock. Brown Transp. Corp. v. Street, 194 Ga. App. 717, 391 S.E.2d 699 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Seller to one thereafter selling in bulk.</b> - This article has no language which compels creditor of one who thereafter sells to another in bulk to look to latter for payment, whether or not as between debtor and debtor's transferee there is an agreement that latter will pay the debt, where original seller has not agreed to substitute transferee in place of purchaser and is stranger to contract between the latter. McClain v. Laurens Glass Co., 127 Ga. App. 316, 193 S.E.2d 194 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Availability of common law remedies.</b> - Where the relationship of the creditor to the bulk transferor is multifaceted, the creditor may pursue common law and equitable remedies, if any, against the transferee without reliance on the bulk transfer law. Boss v. Bassett Furn. Indus. of N.C., Inc., 249 Ga. 166, 288 S.E.2d 559 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There is nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code to indicate that the creditor of a bulk transferor may not proceed on any common law or equitable cause of action the creditor may have against the transferee, notwithstanding the bulk transfer law. On the contrary, the Uniform Commercial Code provides that unless displaced by particular provisions, the principles of law and equity, including fraud, etc., shall supplement its provisions. Boss v. Bassett Furn. Indus. of N.C., Inc., 249 Ga. 166, 288 S.E.2d 559 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.

<p class="p11">(3) The sale shall conform to the terms of the notification. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Statute inapplicable.</b> - Because a stockholder did not seek to enforce an oral contract for the sale of securities, but sought to recover damages for the tortious deprivation of an interest in the corporation, which was already acquired and paid for, the Statute of Frauds in effect at the time of the claim had no bearing on the case. Monterrey Mexican Rest. of Wise, Inc. v. Leon, 282 Ga. App. 439, 638 S.E.2d 879 (2006), overruled on other grounds by Temple v. Hillegass, 344 Ga.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a certificated security include terms stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by reference on the certificate to another instrument, indenture, or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, to the extent the terms referred to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate. A reference under this subsection does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the security, even if the certificate expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice. The terms of an uncertificated security include those stated in any instrument, indenture, or document or in a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is issued. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than one who takes by original issue. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as otherwise provided in Code Section 11-8-205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This Code section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security "when, as and if issued" or "when distributed" in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the subject of the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or distributed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Purpose.</b> - Concept and intention of this article is to provide method whereby all security interests can be perfected. In some instances, filing is required, and in others, possession of collateral is only means available or permitted whereby creditor can perfect security interest. In re Atlanta Times, Inc., 259 F. Supp. 820 (N.D. Ga. 1966), aff'd sub nom. Sanders v. National Acceptance Co. of Am., 383 F.2d 606 (5th Cir. 1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Applicability.</b> - This article applies to security transactions in broad spectrum of tangible and intangible personal property. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Conflicts with Installment Sales Act.</b> - Parties may contract to create security interest which will then be governed by provisions of Uniform Commercial Code unless those provisions conflict with specific terms in Installment Sales Act. Brown v. Jenkins, 135 Ga. App. 694, 218 S.E.2d 690 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Priorities between secured interests and setoff rights.</b> - This article applies to resolving priority disputes between Article 9 secured interests and contractual setoff rights, as distinguished from the creation of the right of setoff. Credit Alliance Corp. v. National Bank, 718 F. Supp. 954 (N.D. Ga. 1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>A valid maritime lien is superior</b> to a perfected nonmaritime UCC security interest in the same collateral. Ambassador Factors v. First Am. Bulk Carrier Corp. (In re Topgallant Lines), 125 Bankr. 682 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 1991), aff'd sub nom. McAllister Towing v. Ambassador Factors (In re Topgallant Lines), 154 Bankr. 368 (S.D. Ga. 1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Perfection gives notice.</b> - Perfection of security interests under T. 40, Ch. 3, Art. 3, as under T. 11, Art. 9, serves purpose of giving notice to subsequent creditors. In re Firth, 363 F. Supp. 369 (M.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Conversion of property subject to security interest.</b> - Where property is subject to security interest, exercise of dominion or control over property which is inconsistent with rights of secured party, constitutes, as to the secured party, conversion of the property; and there may be conversion by secured party where the party acts are in defiance of rights of others in the property. Trust Co. v. Associated Grocers Co-Op., 152 Ga. App. 701, 263 S.E.2d 676 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">Where a sale of collateral is, with respect to the secured party, a conversion of the collateral, there is a conversion on the part of the one who sells, as well as on the part of the one who purchases, and the purchaser may be liable regardless of intent, and regardless of the purchaser's lack of actual knowledge of the rights of the secured party. Trust Co. v. Associated Grocers Co-Op., 152 Ga. App. 701, 263 S.E.2d 676 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Where lease provisions retained title in the lessor</b> and the leased machine was to be returned to the lessor at the termination of the lease with no residual interest therein to the lessee, the lease was not a security instrument and this article does not apply. Capital Assocs. v. Zabel, 172 Ga. App. 19, 322 S.E.2d 67 (1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">Where there was no agreement or intent by either party that the lessee would purchase leased equipment, the fact that the contract obligated the lessee to pay taxes, insurance, and expenses of repairs, and allowed the lessor to retain the equipment after it was returned, did not make the contract a security agreement rather than a lease. City Food Mart, Inc. v. Bell Atl. Tricon Leasing Corp., 218 Ga. App. 57, 460 S.E.2d 525 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Transfer of part of security interest.</b> - There is no Georgia law that requires the simultaneous transfer of an underlying promissory note with the transfer of the security interest. Instead, the Georgia Commercial Code anticipates and allows a secured party's assignment of all or part of its security interest. Tidwell v. Slocumb (In re Ga. Steel, Inc.), 71 Bankr. 903 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Retention of certificate of origin for mobile home.</b> - Where manufacturer retained certificate of origin for mobile home which was "on consignment" and not yet included in a retailer's floor-plan arrangement, it was nonetheless in the retailer's inventory and available for sale to its retail customers, and the rights of the parties were determined under the Uniform Commercial Code rather than the Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act, O.C.G.A. § 40-3-1 et seq. GECC v. Catalina Homes, Inc., 178 Ga. App. 319, 342 S.E.2d 734 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Perfection of security interest in automobile.</b> - When bank financed purchase of car by car leasing business, the correct avenue for perfecting of its security interest in the car was through procedure set forth in the Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act (O.C.G.A. § 40-3-1 et seq.) as opposed to filing of its financial statement under procedures established by the U.C.C. United Carolina Bank v. Capital Auto. Co., 163 Ga. App. 796, 294 S.E.2d 661 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11"><b>Limited partnership agreement.</b> - Where limited partners acquired their interest in a partnership by paying cash and giving a promissory note, and the limited partnership agreement provided that if the note were not paid by a date certain the limited partners' interest in the partnership would be automatically reduced by the fraction of the principal remaining unpaid, the agreement did not constitute a security agreement governed by Article 9. Consolidated Equities Corp. v. Bird, 195 Ga. App. 45, 392 S.E.2d 276 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><b>Definition of "security interest."</b> - "Security interest" means an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation; retention or reservation of title by seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to buyer is limited in effect to reservation of "security interest"; this term also includes any interest of a buyer of accounts, chattel paper or contract rights. 1963-65 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction.</b> - This statute is in derogation of common law and must be strictly construed and followed. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 152 Ga. App. 176, 262 S.E.2d 485 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proceeds of accounts receivable.</b> - A bankruptcy debtor's unearned postpetition income under a contract for employment did not constitute proceeds of the creditor's prepetition interest in accounts receivable. In re Rumker, 184 Bankr. 621 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trademark, trade name, and goodwill.</b> - In addition to a trademark, a trade name, along with the goodwill it represents, may be the subject of an Article 9 security interest and may be reacquired along with other secured property on foreclosure. Reis v. Ralls, 250 Ga. 721, 301 S.E.2d 40 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Computer information and programming</b> recorded on magnetic tape were "general intangibles" which are not included in the types of collateral in which security interests can be perfected by possession under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-305 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-313), and a security interest therein could therefore only be perfected by filing a financing statement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Social media accounts were intangible collateral that was converted.</b> - Trial court's finding that the buyer of an adult novelty business converted the seller's social media accounts after the seller foreclosed due to non-payment was upheld; the accounts constituted part of the business's intangible property and constituted collateral under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-102(a)(43).

<p class="p4"><b>Post bankruptcy milk diversion program payments.</b> - The Farmers Home Administration, which had a pre-petition security agreement extending to the bankruptcy debtors' "farm products," including milk, had a lien which attached to milk proceeds created post bankruptcy. Post-petition milk diversion program payments, therefore, were substitutes for post-petition milk and proceeds, to which the lien attached, and were not "general intangibles." United States v. Hollie, 42 Bankr. 111 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unsecured interest in marital property.</b> - Where evidence supports trial court's holding that wife is entitled to a special lien, wife's lien is superior to any interest of bank in marital property, as the bank was an unsecured creditor whose lien was based on an invalid handwritten note. First Nat'l Bank v. Blackburn, 254 Ga. 379, 329 S.E.2d 897 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insurance benefits considered "proceeds" and subject to lender's security interest.</b> - Insurance benefits payable from a third-party tortfeasor's insurer upon the destruction of a vehicle became "proceeds," subject to a lender's security interest, before payment to the victims. JCS Enter., Inc. v. Vanliner Ins., 227 Ga. App. 371, 489 S.E.2d 95 (1997) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Determination of good faith for jury.</b> - Given the disputed evidence as to the good faith of a transaction, summary judgment awards on the priorities of security interests were not appropriate as the matter had to be remanded to the trial court because the good faith of a transaction was peculiarly a question for the trier of fact. Farm Credit of Northwest Fla., ACA v. Easom Peanut Co., 312 Ga. App. 374, 718 S.E.2d 590 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0444, 2012 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Debtor construed.</b> - A debtor may be construed as anyone who owes payment. Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Barbree, 162 Ga. App. 512, 291 S.E.2d 453, rev'd on other grounds, 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One who is a seller of chattel paper, whether or not that one is the owner of the underlying collateral, with full recourse against the seller in the event of a deficiency is a debtor entitled to notice of the post-default proceedings disposing of the collateral. Barbree v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Owner of collateral.</b> - Because former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-504(3) dealt with disposition of collateral after default, "debtor" in that section meant owner of collateral. Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Barbree, 162 Ga. App. 512, 291 S.E.2d 453, rev'd on other grounds, 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When status of "debtor" attaches.</b> - Buyer of cows who had milked and cared for the cows for several weeks prior to obtaining a loan for their purchase, but who did not finally decide to purchase the cows until after buyer obtained the loan was not a "debtor," and did not take possession until the loan was closed. United States v. Hooks, 40 Bankr. 715 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assignment to surety.</b> - Trial court properly granted a surety's motion for summary judgment because the security interest in the accounts owed was covered by the Uniform Commercial Code, and to the extent that the anti-assignment clauses of the construction contract could be construed to prohibit the roofing company from assigning the company's right to those accounts to the company's surety, the contracts were unenforceable as a matter of law under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-406(d)(1).

<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Inapplicability of former article to deposit accounts.</b> - Since former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-104(j) clearly provided that former Article 9 did not apply to a transfer of an interest in any deposit account, inasmuch as a depositor's commercial checking account is a "deposit account", the structures of that article were not applicable to the bank's appropriation of the account under its right of set-off. Design Spectrum, Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank, 182 Ga. App. 418, 355 S.E.2d 733 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Promissory note.</b> - Under the promissory note, the debtors were consumers who were to pay money to the lender, and the debtor's obligation to do so arose from a transaction involving property that was primarily for the debtors' personal, family, or household purposes; the promissory note was a debt within the plain language of 15 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1692a(5), and the law firm's letter and enclosed documents were an attempt to collect that debt - the complaint sufficiently alleged that the notice was a communication related to the collection of a debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1692e. Even if the firm intended the letter and documents to give notice of the foreclosure to the debtors, the letters also demanded payment on the underlying debt and the fact that the letter and documents related to the enforcement of a security interest did not prevent the letters from also relating to the collection of a debt within the meaning of <span class="s1">§</span> 1692e; the complaint contained enough factual content to allow a reasonable inference that the firm was a debt collector because the firm regularly attempted to collect debts. Reese v. Ellis, Painter, Ratterree &amp; Adams LLP, 678 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Financing statement alone cannot serve as "security agreement,"</b> however, financing statement accompanied by other documents or circumstances may suffice as valid "security agreement." In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Writing signed by debtor, describing collateral and including "security agreement".</b> - For security interest to be enforceable, there must be a writing, signed by debtor, which includes "security agreement" as that term is defined, and which describes collateral. In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Letter agreeing to execute financing statement for stated consideration together with financing statement.</b> - Letter agreeing to execute and return financing statement in consideration of creditor's acceptance of debtor's notes to cover its indebtedness and financing statement, taken together, meet requirements for creation of security agreement; which requires that debtor sign security agreement which contains description of collateral. In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Three-year "lease agreement contract,"</b> by which "lessee" would make monthly payments and, at the end of the three years, without any additional payments, would own the leased equipment, was a security agreement and not a lease. National Traveler, Inc. v. Paccom Leasing Corp., 110 Bankr. 619 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Farmers Home Administration.</b> - Despite the fact that the form executed by the debtors did not contain a clause that "granted" a security interest to the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), considering other language in the form, including a heading "Security Agreement (chattels and crops)," a reference to the FmHA as the "Secured Party," and a provision which read: "It is the purpose and intent of this instrument that . . . this instrument shall secure payment of the note," the debtors did grant the FmHA a security interest in crops, livestock and offspring, farm equipment, and farm products.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No writing established.</b> - Creditor did not establish that the creditor had a valid security interest under Georgia law because there was no evidence of a specific writing, signed by the debtor, that reflected an intent to create a security interest, and that reasonably identified the personal property as collateral.

<p class="p4"><b>Parent was not secured party and had no standing.</b> - No public record allowed a criminal defendant's parent to perfect an implied trust (based on the parent's allegation that the parent paid for cars but titled them in the son's name for insurance purposes) against bona fide purchaser for value; so, in a O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-13-49 forfeiture proceeding of two cars, the parent was not the statutory "owner" or "interest holder" as those terms were defined in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-102 and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-13-49(a)(7), (n)(3), (o)(3), (a)(6), and the parent thus lacked standing to contest the forfeiture.

For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enforceable title-retention agreement</b> constitutes purchase money security interest within definition of that term. Food Serv. Equip. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank, 121 Ga. App. 421, 174 S.E.2d 216 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security interest to secure preexisting account balance.</b> - Security interest taken by the creditor, not to secure all or part of the purchase price of the collateral, but rather to secure the preexisting balance of the debtor's account with the creditor, did not fall within the definition of a purchase money security interest. In re Carter, 169 Bankr. 227 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase money security interest in collateral purchased with loan proceeds.</b> - One who is a "lender," may acquire purchase money security interest in collateral to be purchased with proceeds of loan provided proceeds are in fact so used. Continental Oil Co. Agrico Chem. Co. Div. v. Sutton, 126 Ga. App. 78, 189 S.E.2d 925 (1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unexercised future advances clause.</b> - Where seller, rather than lender, claims purchase-money security interest, unexercised future advances clause is immaterial. Meadows v. Household Retail Servs., Inc. (In re Griffin), 9 Bankr. 880 (N.D. Ga. 1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank financing sales price of mobile home.</b> - Where seller sold mobile home for cash sales price and bank financed loan for cash sales price, proceeds of which were then paid to seller, the bank, not seller, had purchase money security interest in the mobile home, and actual sale was not a retail installment transaction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-31(a)(9). Massey v. Stephens, 155 Ga. App. 243, 270 S.E.2d 796 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Price limitation on security interest.</b> - Purchase money security interest must be in the item purchased, and if vendor of consumer goods is to be protected despite absence of filing, security interest cannot exceed price of item purchased in transaction out of which it arose. Roberts Furn. Co. v. Pierce, 507 F.2d 990 (5th Cir. 1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer and assignment of a purchase money note and security agreement to a third party</b> did not destroy the purchase money character of the security interest, where the assignment did not refinance, renew, or modify the debtor's purchase money debt. Brooks v. First Franklin Fin. Corp., 74 Bankr. 418 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refinancing or consolidation of loans.</b> - Refinancing or consolidating loans by paying off an old loan and extending a new one extinguishes the purchase money character of the original loan because the proceeds of the new loan are not used to acquire rights in the collateral. Franklin v. ITT Fin. Servs., 75 Bankr. 268 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under Georgia law, the refinancing of a promissory note destroys the purchase money nature of the security interest. Hipps v. Landmark Fin. Servs., 89 Bankr. 264 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the debt secured contained both purchase money and nonpurchase money components, including the refinancing of prior obligations, the security interest of the creditor could not retain purchase money status, as it secured more than the "price" of the collateral. Lee v. Davis/McGraw, Inc., 169 Bankr. 790 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When debtor refinanced a prior purchase of furniture when the debtor financed a second purchase, the seller lost the seller's purchase money security interest status on the balance due from the first purchase because the installment contract failed to specify the order in which add-on costs, i.e., late fee, delivery fee, credit life insurance, and property insurance, abated upon payment. In re McClow,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. S.D. Ga. Dec. 17, 2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Additional items purchased with collateral.</b> - Simultaneous purchase on credit of a vehicle and an extended service contract, and payment of a documentary fee and a certificate of title fee, did not transform the secured creditor's claim into a non-purchase money security interest, disqualifying its claim for treatment under the hanging paragraph at the end of 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1325(a), because the cost of the additional items was part of the price of the vehicle. In re Murray, 352 Bankr. 340 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase money interest in negative equity financed as part of trade-in.</b> - Because the definition of "cash sales price" under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-103(a)(2) included any amount paid to the buyer or to a third party to satisfy a lease on or a lien on or a security interest in a motor vehicle used as a trade-in, that entire amount was included in the purchase money security interest under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1325(a). In re Graupner, 356 Bankr. 907 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2006), aff'd, NO. 4:07-CV-37 (CDL), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46144 (M.D. Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Monies paid on debtor's behalf for an extended service contract and gap insurance were part of the purchase price of the debtor's vehicle for purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-103 and the unnumbered, hanging paragraph following 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1325(a)(9). The service contract was a charge for "servicing" the motor vehicle under O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-31(a)(1), and applying the close nexus standard in <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-103 led the court to believe that gap insurance was also included in the purchase money security interest. In re Spratling, 377 Bankr. 941 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a debtor purchased a vehicle for personal use within 910 days of filing a bankruptcy petition under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1325(a), the cramdown provision of 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 506 did not apply; instead, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-103 determined that the purchase money security interest included the negative equity of a trade-in that was integral to the sales transaction. Graupner v. Nuvell Credit Corp.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(M.D. Ga. June 26, 2007), aff'd, 537 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 10-1-31(a) and 11-9-103, negative equity in a debtor's trade-in vehicle was properly regarded as a purchase money security interest under the hanging paragraph referencing 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1325(a)(5) in that there was a close nexus to the purchase of a vehicle for personal use within 910 days of filing for Chapter 13 relief. Thus, 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 506 did not apply to cram down the creditor's secured claim. Graupner v. Nuvell Credit Corp. (In re Graupner), 537 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Distribution of loan proceeds subsequent to closing of loan.</b> - Lender obtained a purchase-money security interest in cows sold by a third party to the debtor although the debtor took care of the cows for the purpose of inspecting and milking several weeks before the loan was closed and legal ownership passed, and although the money was disbursed almost two weeks after the loan was closed, since the loan and its disbursement were closely allied to the sale.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency in financing statements.</b> - Property listed in financing statements need not be specific but must only reasonably identify same, giving dated leases and amount of same, "secured by" equipment listed in leases and its location. Stephens v. Bank of Camilla, 133 Ga. App. 210, 210 S.E.2d 358 (1974), aff'd, 234 Ga. 293, 216 S.E.2d 71 (1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Physical description in financing statement need not be sufficient in itself to identify the property. It is sufficient if description provides such key to identity of property as would enable a person of ordinary business prudence, upon inquiry, to discover actual identity of property described. Abney v. ITT Diversified Credit Corp. (In re Environmental Elec. Sys.), 11 Bankr. 965 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Description of the collateral contained in the financing statement was insufficient because the description did not indicate that the collateral covered all assets or all personal property of the debtor, nor did the description meet the requirements under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-108 for a reasonable identification. If the description had been "all future receivables of the Debtor," it would have met the requirements under <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-108 by describing the collateral through category. Scarver v. Silverline Servs. (In re Wastetech, LLC), 605 Bankr. 264 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Description need not be of exact or detailed nature.</b> - Courts should refuse to follow holdings, often found in older chattel mortgage cases, that descriptions are insufficient unless they are of exact and detailed nature, i.e., so-called "serial number" test. BVA Credit Corp. v. Mullins, 552 F.2d 1145 (5th Cir. 1977) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient description enables one to identify thing described.</b> - Test of the sufficiency of a description is that the description do the job assigned to it, that it make possible identification of thing described. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of description is question of law, while identity is question of fact.</b> - Question of sufficiency of description of property is one of law, for the court; that of identity of property is one of fact, to be decided by jury. Bank of Cumming v. Chapman, 245 Ga. 261, 264 S.E.2d 201 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Description of collateral in security agreements.</b> - Purchase money security agreements on consumer goods are not required to be filed, and purpose of description of collateral in such agreements is not to give notice, as a financing statement, but is to provide identification of collateral so as to avoid disputes over its identity. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Requirement that identification of collateral indicate type of collateral is applicable to financing statements, not security agreements. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bankruptcy court found that: (1) the equipment in issue was incorrectly described in both the security agreement and the financing statement; and (2) the rights of the debtor, as a hypothetical lien creditor, were superior to the rights of the creditor. Deere Credit, Inc. v. Pickle Logging, Inc. (In re Pickle Logging, Inc.), 286 Bankr. 181 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Description by model and serial number.</b> - Description of collateral in a purchase money security agreement by model and serial number alone meets requirements of former <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-203(1)(b) and 11-9-110, where secured party named is manufacturer or dealer in specialty appliances sold under trade name. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Merely stating incorrect serial number</b> will not vitiate contract if key is there. Thomas Ford Tractor, Inc. v. North Ga. Prod. Credit Ass'n, 153 Ga. App. 820, 266 S.E.2d 571 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Description of land or crops.</b> - Description in security instrument of land or crops must raise warning flag, providing key to identity of property. United States v. Big Z Whse., 311 F. Supp. 283 (S.D. Ga. 1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Crop need not be described as tobacco crop when all crops on land are collateral for debt. The description that reasonably identifies what is described is adequate. United States v. Big Z Whse., 311 F. Supp. 283 (S.D. Ga. 1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining whether record gives sufficient notice.</b> - Whether record gives sufficient notice depends not only on language appearing in mortgage, but also upon what a person of ordinary business prudence would have ascertained from pursuing such lines of inquiry as data given in mortgage would naturally suggest to the reasonable person's mind; and, additionally, any further information actually possessed by claimants at time of transaction, which would have led an ordinary man to believe that dealings were with mortgaged property, or would ordinarily have led the reasonable man to further inquiry, may be taken into consideration in determining whether they had notice of lien, or were legally chargeable with notice. Yancey Bros. Co. v. Dehco, Inc., 108 Ga. App. 875, 134 S.E.2d 828 (1964) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Valid security interest in airplane established.</b> - While description of bank's collateral as "67 #402 Cessna" could be ambiguous to one who is unaware that a "Cessna" is an airplane, the note and documents obtained by the bank from the borrower when it made the loan removed all doubt that the bank did have a valid security interest in the plane. F &amp; M Bank v. State, 167 Ga. App. 77, 306 S.E.2d 11 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ordinary meaning of "unsecured".</b> - Ordinary meaning of "unsecured" is that there is no security interest that can be effective against third parties under the Georgia Uniform Commercial Code, specifically O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-109. In re Estate of Sims, 259 Ga. App. 786, 578 S.E.2d 498 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Federal statutory preemption of article.</b> - Where a bank, based on its prior perfected security interest, sued a cattle-raiser for cattle in possession, the trial court correctly ruled that the Federal Security Act (7 U.S.C.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1631), which controlled the transaction, preempted this article and properly awarded summary judgment to cattle-raiser. Ashburn Bank v. Farr, 206 Ga. App. 517, 426 S.E.2d 63 (1992) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Maritime liens.</b> - Creditor-holder of a properly perfected UCC security interest in debtor's freights did not take priority over holders of valid maritime liens. While freights fall within the literal terms of the definitions in former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-106, their inclusion therein does not subject maritime lien claimants to UCC priority rules. First, former subsection (a) of this section excludes security interests arising under federal statutes from the ambit of the UCC; unlike former subsection (b). Its state law counterpart, former subsection (a) does not specifically subject federal liens to UCC priority provisions. Second, former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-102 excludes non-consensual transactions from the UCC. Maritime liens by nature arise without intent or consent. Finally, maritime liens take priority over UCC security interests under pre-or post-UCC cases. McAllister Towing v. Ambassador Factors, (In re Topgallant Lines), 154 Bankr. 368 (S.D. Ga. 1993), aff'd, 20 F.3d 1175 (11th Cir. 1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Priority over bank's right of setoff.</b> - The Code's priority rules require that a perfected security interest will prevail over a bank's right of setoff. Continental Am. Life Ins. Co. v. Griffin, 251 Ga. 412, 306 S.E.2d 285 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank's right of setoff superior.</b> - In a case predicated on the Georgia tort law of conversion, a district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of a bank was affirmed because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-109(a)(1) and (d)(10)(A), and 11-9-340 governed the effectiveness of setoff rights in deposit accounts, brought the case expressly within the authority of the Uniform Commercial Code, and provided that the bank's setoff right was superior to any security interest of a company in a predecessor company's deposited funds.

<p class="p4"><b>Transfer and assignment of note and security deed not interest in real estate.</b> - Even though a debtor gave possession of a note and security deed and executed a transfer and assignment of the instruments to the creditor as collateral for a loan, the instruments never vested in the creditor and the transaction was not the creation or transfer of an interest in real estate under former subsection (h); thus, where the creditor did not comply with the notice requirement of former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-305(2), the debtor was entitled to recover either damages for conversion of the collateral after default or damages prescribed by former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-507.

<p class="p4">Surety is "secured" by its right of subrogation, which relates back to issuance of bond, to defeat intervening creditors.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rights in collateral required.</b> - Fundamental to secured party's acquisition of security interest in property of debtor is that debtor have rights in collateral. A security interest can be created in no other property. Anthony v. Community Loan &amp; Inv. Corp., 559 F.2d 1363 (5th Cir. 1977) (decided prior to 1978 amendment which incorporated parts of <span class="s1">§</span> 109A-9-204 into what was <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-203) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One cannot encumber another person's property in the absence of consent, estoppel, or some other special rule. Russell v. Lawrence, 234 Ga. App. 612, 507 S.E.2d 161 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase money security interests.</b> - To perfect purchase money security interest and for it to be enforceable against debtor and third parties, there must be a written agreement, signed by debtor under former subsection (1) of this section and filing of a financing statement under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-302(1). Food Serv. Equip. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank, 121 Ga. App. 421, 174 S.E.2d 216 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Financing statements.</b> - A financing statement merely gives notice of the existence of a security interest but in itself does not create a security interest, for which a security agreement is required. Amoco Oil Co. v. G. Sims &amp; Assocs., 162 Ga. App. 307, 291 S.E.2d 128 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A financing statement cannot serve as a security agreement because it does not grant the creditor a security interest in the collateral and does not identify the obligation owed to the creditor. Amoco Oil Co. v. G. Sims &amp; Assocs., 162 Ga. App. 307, 291 S.E.2d 128 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security agreement was unenforceable.</b> - Where bank did not introduce written security agreement but instead relied upon its officer's deposition indicating that it possessed car's certificate of title, which car dealer had given to bank pursuant to its financing the dealer's inventory, and where certificate of title, purportedly executed in blank, was not produced, bank's failure to establish compliance with former subsection (1)(a) of this section rendered security interest unenforceable by means of summary judgment. Holloway v. F &amp; M Bank, 151 Ga. App. 424, 260 S.E.2d 380 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Unless secured party is in possession of collateral, the party's security interest, absent writing which satisfies former subsection (1)(a), is not enforceable even against debtor, and cannot be made so on theory of equitable mortgage or the like. McDonald v. Peoples Auto. Loan &amp; Fin. Corp., 115 Ga. App. 483, 154 S.E.2d 886 (1967) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The purchasers of a horse farm did not have a right in certain horses superior to that of the vendor's former partner based on the horses as collateral for a secured transaction, where the former partner was awarded the horses in a judgment against the vendor and, thus, the collateral did not belong to the vendor/debtor and the security interest did not attach. Russell v. Lawrence, 234 Ga. App. 612, 507 S.E.2d 161 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Writing not required.</b> - Where collateral is in possession of secured party, evidentiary need for written record is much less than where collateral is in debtor's possession, and under this article, as at common law, writing is not a formal requisite in former situation. Barton v. Chemical Bank, 577 F.2d 1329 (5th Cir. 1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Good faith purchaser.</b> - A bank was a good faith purchaser for value of certain cars under the following circumstances: The proprietor of a used-car business maintained a special checking account with the bank; the proprietor purchased cars from a car auction company with checks drawn upon this account and he then executed a promissory note to the bank, which loaned the proprietor the purchase price and took a security interest in the car; the account became overdrawn and the bank refused to honor the checks made out to the auction company. Georgia Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Tennille Banking Co. (In re Smith), 51 Bankr. 904 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insurance benefits considered "proceeds" and subject to lender's security interest.</b> - Insurance benefits payable from a third-party tortfeasor's insurer upon the destruction of a vehicle became "proceeds," subject to a lender's security interest, before payment to the victims. JCS Enter., Inc. v. Vanliner Ins., 227 Ga. App. 371, 489 S.E.2d 95 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bankruptcy court found that under the security deed the credit company held a valid security interest in the destroyed property and the security deed provided sufficient language to grant the credit company a security interest in the proceeds of the collateral, including any insurance proceeds. Altegra Credit Co. v. Ford Motor Credit Co. (In re Brantley), 286 Bankr. 918 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Computer information and programming.</b> - Computer information and programming recorded on magnetic tape were "general intangibles" which are not included in the types of collateral in which security interests can be perfected by possession under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-305, and a security interest therein could therefore only be perfected by filing a financing statement. Dabney v. Information Exch., Inc., 98 Bankr. 603 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security interest in the proceeds.</b> - After a Chapter 13 debtors' vehicle was destroyed in an accident after confirmation of the plan, the failure of the secured creditor to introduce the insurance policy into evidence, meant that the court could not determine if the creditor had an independent right to the proceeds in addition to its Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 rights; the creditor proved only that it had a security interest in the proceeds and, therefore, Article 9 governed and the insurance payout was proceeds of the collateral. In re Jones,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. S.D. Ga. June 4, 2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language held sufficient to prove security interest.</b> - Bank that extended credit to a debtor before the debtor declared Chapter 13 bankruptcy, so the debtor could purchase merchandise using a credit card, had an enforceable security interest under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-203 in goods the debtor obtained using the credit card, and a plan the debtor filed for repaying creditors could not be confirmed under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1325 because the plan treated the bank's claim as an unsecured claim. An application the debtor completed when the debtor applied for the credit card stated that the debtor granted a business a purchase money security interest in goods purchased on the debtor's account. Thomas G. v. HSBC Nev., N.A. (In re Thomas G.),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Dec. 21, 2009)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act.</b> - Failure to comply with the Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-3-1 et seq.) with respect to the perfection of a security interest (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-3-50(b)) does not affect the creation of the security interest, which remains a matter of contract between the parties. Spoon v. Herndon, 167 Ga. App. 794, 307 S.E.2d 693 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Uniform Commercial Code financing statement found not to cover mobile home.</b> See Homac, Inc. v. Fort Wayne Mtg. Co., 577 F. Supp. 1065 (N.D. Ga. 1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Passage of title.</b> - When the peanut growers completed the performance of the growers' duties under the growers' contracts with a peanut broker by delivering the growers' peanuts to a peanut company, title passed to the broker. Farm Credit of Northwest Fla., ACA v. Easom Peanut Co., 312 Ga. App. 374, 718 S.E.2d 590 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0444, 2012 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficiency of Writing</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements, generally.</b> - For a security interest to be enforceable, there must be a writing signed by debtor, which includes "security agreement" as that term is defined, which describes collateral. In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Two creditors who loaned money to a debtor to buy a truck and who were named by the debtor as a "lienholder" on the debtor's application for a title won a ruling sustaining their objection to the debtor's proposed Chapter 13 plan in which the creditors' interest was treated as an unsecured interest, because Georgia law did not require the use of "magic words" to create an enforceable security interest and because the three documents signed by the debtor in connection with the transaction satisfied the requirements in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-203(b)(3)(A) for the creation of an enforceable security interest, and were consistent with the debtor's testimony that the debtor knew that the creditors would have a lien on the debtor's truck. In re Flager,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. M.D. Ga. June 8, 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signatures on face of documents.</b> - Placing of initials and/or signatures on face of documents does not suffice to authenticate title retention agreement on reverse and as consequence does not entitle creditor to priority over disputed collateral. Food Serv. Equip. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank, 121 Ga. App. 421, 174 S.E.2d 216 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Party does not receive signed security agreement from debtor with reference to sales orders where only signing appears on face of instruments and neither sale order nor delivery receipt makes any reference to reverse side of documents. Food Serv. Equip. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank, 121 Ga. App. 421, 174 S.E.2d 216 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signature on security agreement required for aircraft.</b> - In a preferential transfer action under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 547(b), while the trustee satisfied the trustee's burden as to many of the elements and was entitled to a partial summary judgment as to those elements, the trustee was not entitled to summary judgment under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 547(b)(5) regarding the debtor's conveyance of an aircraft because there were material fact issues as to the existence of a security agreement, the amount of the debt, the value of the aircraft, and whether the security interest was filed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In this case, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-203(b)(3)(A), in order to have an enforceable security interest, there had to be a signed security agreement. Kelley v. Murphy (In re McConnell), 455 Bankr. 824 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Written assignments of debt.</b> - Letter written by creditor to debtor stating that the creditor "has assigned" debt to third party, which letter bears "acceptance" by debtor of assignment, and on the basis of which assignee lends money to assignor, is sufficient writing to create security interest in assignee, attaching at time of loan to assignor. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Capital Constr. Co., 112 Ga. App. 189, 144 S.E.2d 465 (1965) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Language held insufficient to prove security interest.</b> - Sales invoices, which stated that sales of household goods were subject to a "charge agreement," were not sufficient to prove the existence of a security interest, where such invoices did not constitute a security agreement but merely gave notice of the existence of one. Grier v. Skinner's Furn. Store of Newnan, Inc., 180 Ga. App. 607, 349 S.E.2d 826 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Description</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of description in unfiled security agreements.</b> - Purchase money security agreements on consumer goods are not required to be filed, and purpose of description of collateral in such agreements is not to give notice, as on a financing statement, but is to provide identification of collateral so as to avoid disputes over its identity. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of description.</b> - Test of the sufficiency of a description is that the description do job assigned to it, that it make possible identification of thing described. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Written security agreement satisfies this provision if it is signed by debtor and contains description of collateral. Additional requirement of description of collateral is necessary to solve the evidentiary problem of identifying collateral when secured party lacks possession of it. Barton v. Chemical Bank, 577 F.2d 1329 (5th Cir. 1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Type of collateral.</b> - Requirement that identification of collateral indicate type of collateral is applicable to financing statements, not security agreements. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Model and serial number.</b> - Description of collateral in a purchase money security agreement by model and serial number alone meets requirements of former <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-203(1)(b) and 11-9-110, where secured party named is manufacturer or dealer in specialty appliances sold under trade name. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Accounts receivable.</b> - Where the security agreement, like the financing statement, provided that creditor had a security interest in "all those items of personal property" located on debtor's premises, but the security agreement went further than the financing statement by including "all replacements and accessions thereto," the scope of the security agreement was thereby limited to debtor's personal property and any replacements and accessions, and this description did not entail accounts receivable. Thus, like the financing statement, the security agreement failed to place third parties on notice of a possible security interest in accounts receivable. Healthcorp, Inc. v. Southeastern Emergency Healthcare, 85 Bankr. 170 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security agreement lacked description of collateral.</b> - Security agreement lacked description of collateral required for perfection of a security interest, where, although the agreement referred to a "Collateral List and Valuation," there was no record of a "Collateral List and Valuation" document. ITT Fin. Servs. v. Gibson, 188 Ga. App. 188, 372 S.E.2d 468 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Crops.</b> - Crop need not be described as tobacco crop when all crops on land are collateral for the debt, such description reasonably identifies what is described. United States v. Big Z Whse., 311 F. Supp. 283 (S.D. Ga. 1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Description in security instrument of land or crops must raise warning flag, providing key to identity of property. United States v. Big Z Whse., 311 F. Supp. 283 (S.D. Ga. 1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A debtor may not defeat the rights acquired by the creditor in existing or future crops by turning over the property described in the financing statement to a third party to produce a crop covered by the terms of the statement, where such statement has been executed and recorded according to law. Southwest Ga. Prod. Credit Ass'n v. James, 180 Ga. App. 795, 350 S.E.2d 786 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A credit association's security interest in a pea crop grown on debtor's land attached at the time the crop was planted. Southwest Ga. Prod. Credit Ass'n v. James, 180 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Animals.</b> - Where the security agreements signed by a debtor for a loan did not cover after-acquired collateral, nor did it cover the offspring of the pigs purchased with these funds, the bank did not have a valid security interest in the offspring of the pigs. F &amp; M Bank v. Alexander, 70 Bankr. 419 (M.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Attachment</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attachment.</b> - Security interest attaches as soon as parties reach agreement, creditor gives value, and debtor has rights in collateral, unless explicit agreement postpones time of attaching. Barton v. Chemical Bank, 577 F.2d 1329 (5th Cir. 1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where additional collateral is given to secure antecedent debt, new value is not necessary before a security interest will attach. However, where there is a purchase money security interest in crop to be grown, new value is necessary. United States v. Big Z Whse., 311 F. Supp. 283 (S.D. Ga. 1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is self-evident that in absence of special circumstances, a security interest can attach only to extent of interest of debtor. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Smithloff, 119 Ga. App. 284, 167 S.E.2d 190 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Three elements for attachment.</b> - For security interests governed by Article 9 of Georgia's Uniform Commercial Code, three conditions must be met before they may be enforceable against anyone, including the debtor: (i) unless the secured party possesses the collateral, there must be a written security agreement signed by the debtor and containing a description of the collateral; (ii) the secured party must have given value; and (iii) the debtor must have rights in the collateral. These three elements were met and the creditor's security interest in the debtor's inventory and its proceeds had been properly attached.

For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Scope.</b> - This section governs whether, in a security agreement, after-acquired property is subject to a security interest. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with federal law.</b> - State law determines whether lender possesses substantive interest in property securing performance of obligation, while Regulation Z <span class="s1">§</span> 226.8(b)(5), 15 U.S.C. Appx 12 CFR <span class="s1">§</span> 226.8, under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1601 et seq., merely defines whether this state-created substantive right constitutes a security interest for federal disclosure purposes. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guaranty on real estate.</b> - Execution of guaranty, although ineffective to create security interest in debtor's residence, since real property is excluded from operation of Article 9, was effective to create a security interest in cash proceeds from sale of debtor's residence. United States v. Wood, 28 Bankr. 383 (N.D. Ga. 1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Additional collateral given to secure antecedent debt.</b> - Where additional collateral is given to secure antecedent debt, new value is not necessary before security interest will attach. However, where there is a purchase money security interest in crop to be grown, new value is necessary. United States v. Big Z Whse., 311 F. Supp. 283 (S.D. Ga. 1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Magic words" not required.</b> - Although the security agreement must provide that after-acquired collateral is covered under the security agreement, no "magic words" are required in the drafting. The test is whether a reasonable man looking at the entire security agreement and financing statement would recognize that the parties intended to secure after-acquired property. Kubota Tractor Corp. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 198 Ga. App. 830, 403 S.E.2d 218 (1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Floating liens.</b> - "Floating lien" theory, by which all subsequently acquired property comes under earlier security instrument, has been approved by this section, however, former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-312 provides seller of noninventory goods under purchase money contract with right to retain priority provided the seller perfects the security interest before delivery or within ten days after delivery. Babson Credit Plan, Inc. v. Cordele Prod. Credit Ass'n, 146 Ga. App. 266, 246 S.E.2d 354 (1978) (decided prior to 1978 amendment of former Code Section 11-9-204, which changed time limit for perfecting under prior <span class="s1">§</span> 109A-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unperfected interest of seller of fixtures.</b> - Where seller of personal property which is later affixed to realty retains security interest in the goods, which is not perfected, the seller's security interest attaches upon delivery and is superior to another creditor's prior perfected security interest in personalty and "after-acquired" "personal property" and "equipment of every description" of the common debtor when such "after-acquired" personalty is affixed to realty as fixtures. Babson Credit Plan, Inc. v. Cordele Prod. Credit Ass'n, 146 Ga. App. 266, 246 S.E.2d 354 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security interest in after-acquired fixtures.</b> - Section does not apply to creation of real estate security interest in after-acquired fixtures, even though those fixtures might otherwise be encompassed in code definition of consumer goods on basis of their physical and utilitarian characteristics; a real estate interest in fixtures arises pursuant to real estate law and is contingent upon item of property attaining legal status of fixture, as defined by that law. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Property located in different place.</b> - After-acquired property clause may be interpreted to include property located in a different place than the location specified in the agreement where the reference to the location of the secured property is to facilitate identification of that property, not to limit the attachment of the security interest to only after-acquired property kept at that location. Hudson Properties, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 168 Ga. App. 331, 308 S.E.2d 708 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mobile homes.</b> - Transaction between a mobile home manufacturer and a retail dealer, involving a mobile home claimed by a floor-plan financer, was a "sale or return," and the mobile home was subject to the financer's claim arising from a security interest in the dealer's after-acquired inventory without regard to whether the manufacturer was compensated for the mobile home. GECC v. Catalina Homes, Inc., 178 Ga. App. 319, 342 S.E.2d 734 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Animals.</b> - Where the security agreement signed by debtor for a loan did not cover after-acquired collateral, nor did it cover the offspring of the pigs purchased with these funds, the bank did not have a valid security interest in the offspring of the pigs. F &amp; M Bank v. Alexander, 70 Bankr. 419 (M.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Truth in Lending Act.</b> - Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.S. <span class="s1">§</span> 1601 et seq., requires lender to explain ten-day limitation of former subsection (2) of this section so that borrower is informed that any consumer goods which the borrower may acquire within ten days of loan transaction are subject to security interest and that any consumer goods acquired after that date are not. Glenn v. Trust Co., 152 Ga. App. 314, 262 S.E.2d 590 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After-acquired property was included under the part in a security agreement providing that a loan was secured by "all equipment, accessories and parts added or attached thereto," and the failure of a lender to disclose in the agreement the ten-day limitation of former subsection (2) of this section on after-acquired property subject to the lender's security interest violated a regulation of the Truth in Lending Act. Brown v. Termplan, Inc., 693 F.2d 1047 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-204). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of financing statement can perfect only those interests acquired through security agreements.</b> Tri-County Livestock Auction Co. v. Bank of Madison, 228 Ga. 325, 185 S.E.2d 393 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Financing statements and security agreements distinguished.</b> - Financing statement merely gives notice of existence of security interest but in itself does not create a security interest, for which a security agreement is required. Trust Co. v. Associated Grocers Co-Op., 152 Ga. App. 701, 263 S.E.2d 676 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements to perfect purchase money security interests.</b> - To perfect a purchase money security interest and for it to be enforceable against debtor and third parties, there must be a written agreement, signed by debtor under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-203(1)(b) and filing of financing statement under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-302(1) (see now <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-310). Food Serv. Equip. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank, 121 Ga. App. 421, 174 S.E.2d 216 (1970) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creditor did not file financing statement.</b> - Georgia's Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code requires proper filing of a financing statement in order to perfect an interest in personal property. The creditor did not dispute that a financing statement indicating the creditor's security interest in any of the debtor's personal property had not been filed and, therefore, the creditor held an unperfected security interest in the debtor's personal property, including the debtor's inventory and its proceeds; thus, the creditor was not an entity with an interest in cash collateral within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 363. In re Shree Meldikrupa Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. S.D. Ga. Jan. 15, 2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Computer information and programming.</b> - Computer information and programming recorded on magnetic tape were "general intangibles" which are not included in the types of collateral in which security interests can be perfected by possession under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-305 (see now <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-313), and a security interest therein could therefore only be perfected by filing a financing statement. Dabney v. Information Exch., Inc., 98 Bankr. 603 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Pre-petition enforcement.</b> - Creditor had a valid post-petition lien in rents, profits, and proceeds from a Chapter 11 debtor's hotel operations, though the creditor took no pre-petition enforcement action under Georgia law, as its lien in the pre-petition rents was valid from the time of recording, and the lien in post-petition rents was valid from the time of the bankruptcy filing. In re Resort Inns, Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. S.D. Ga. Aug. 30, 2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Security interest in accounts.</b> - This section required filing of financing statement to perfect security interest in accounts. M.D. Hodges Enters., Inc. v. First Ga. Bank, 243 Ga. 664, 256 S.E.2d 350 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equipment lessors.</b> - To take precedence over previously recorded loan deed covering subsequently purchased equipment, equipment lessor must perfect security interest. Citizens &amp; S. Equip. Leasing, Inc. v. Atlanta Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 144 Ga. App. 800, 243 S.E.2d 243 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Banks.</b> - Bank perfected security interest by filing UCC financing statement. See Trust Co. Bank v. Walker, 35 Bankr. 237 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Perfection by Possession</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security interest in money is perfected by possession.</b> - Security interest in money (either originally given or received as proceeds from negotiation of instrument) is perfected by possession. In re Atlanta Times, Inc., 259 F. Supp. 820 (N.D. Ga. 1966), aff'd sub. nom. Sanders v. National Acceptance Co. of Am., 383 F.2d 606 (5th Cir. 1967) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Perfected security interest had priority over attempted reservation of title.</b> - Peanut growers' attempted reservation of title when the growers delivered peanuts to a peanut company at a peanut broker's direction amounted to a security interest; however, the growers never perfected the growers' security interests. A cooperative bank's security interest in the peanuts was perfected as the bank had filed financing statements and the security interest had attached so that the bank's perfected security interest had priority over the growers' unperfected security interests. Farm Credit of Northwest Fla., ACA v. Easom Peanut Co., 312 Ga. App. 374, 718 S.E.2d 590 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0444, 2012 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Consumer Goods</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - This section, pursuant to which purchase money security interest in consumer goods is perfected without filing, does not violate equal protection, is a rational classification, and does not violate due process because it does not provide notice by filing, since existence of exception is sufficient to put corporate entities on notice. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of description in unfiled security agreement.</b> - Purchase money security agreements on consumer goods are not required to be filed, and purpose of description of collateral in unfiled security agreement is not to give notice, as on a financing statement, but is to provide identification of collateral so as to avoid disputes over its identity. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interest in consumer goods cannot exceed price.</b> - Purchase money security interest must be in the item purchased, and if vendor of consumer goods is to be protected despite absence of filing security interest cannot exceed price of item purchased in transaction out of which it arose. Roberts Furn. Co. v. Pierce, 507 F.2d 990 (5th Cir. 1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Household goods.</b> - A purchase-money security interest in household goods is automatically perfected without filing. Dennis v. W.S. Badcock Corp., 31 Bankr. 128 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Filing requirements.</b> - Financing statement must be filed to perfect all security interests unless assignment to assignee does not transfer a significant part of outstanding contract rights of assignor. Park Ave. Bank v. Bassford, 232 Ga. 216, 205 S.E.2d 861 (1974) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exceptions from filing requirements.</b> - Official comment to this section indicates that exception from filing for isolated or casual assignment of accounts is not available to "any person who regularly takes assignments of any debtor's account"; a bank which regularly loans money and accepts accounts as security must file to perfect its security interests and cannot rely on automatic perfection. M.D. Hodges Enters., Inc. v. First Ga. Bank, 243 Ga. 664, 256 S.E.2d 350 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Assignment of future proceeds.</b> - Debtor's assignment to bank of specific amounts from future proceeds from debtor's business was not exempted from this article and was required to be perfected by the filing of a financing statement. Bank of Cave Spring v. Gold Kist, Inc., 173 Ga. App. 679, 327 S.E.2d 800 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act.</b> - Security interest in motor vehicle may be perfected under Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act, Ga.

App. 418, 151 S.E.2d 530 (1966) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-302). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As a result of adoption of former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-302 and the UCC, the only way to perfect security interest in motor vehicles is by filing under Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act, Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Centralized method of filing security interests in vehicles.</b> - Legal result of passage of Uniform Commercial Code was to replace prior law and provide for only one centralized method of filing security interests in pre-1963 motor vehicles. Any such security interest filed subsequent to effective date of Uniform Commercial Code, to be valid, must be filed pursuant to provisions of the Georgia Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act, Ga. L. 1968, p. 68 et seq. Maley v. National Acceptance Co., 250 F. Supp. 841 (N.D. Ga. 1966). But see In re Chappell, 224 Bankr. 507 (Bankr.

A party who purchases a car from another party, who purchased the car at a judicial sale after the car, which had an unperfected security interest on it, was sold to satisfy a judgment against the owner's spouse, is such an innocent party.

<p class="p4"><b>Scope of section.</b> - This section deals with perfection of security interests so as to protect and give priority to secured creditors over claims of third parties in personal property taken as security; it does not govern creation of property rights or security interests. McCrackin v. Hayes, 118 Ga. App. 267, 163 S.E.2d 246 (1968) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-305).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations of this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of perfection.</b> - Following perfection of security interest, other creditors enjoy no priority over such security interest. General Lithographing Co. v. Sight &amp; Sound Projectors, Inc., 128 Ga. App. 304, 196 S.E.2d 479 (1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Knowledge of security interest.</b> - Where security interest in an automobile was not properly recorded and was documented only in divorce decree's incorporated agreement, the secured party failed to carry the burden of proving that buyer had actual knowledge of the secured party's interest, even assuming the buyer had knowledge of the divorce. Freeman v. Bentley, 205 Ga. App. 409, 422 S.E.2d 435 (1992) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As a cotton gin bought a farmer's cotton crop with actual knowledge, as defined by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-201(25), (27), of a bank's security interest therein, but still withheld some of the proceeds of the sale, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-315(a)(1), the gin was liable to the bank for conversion and was not entitled to summary judgment. Bank of Dawson v. Worth Gin Co., 295 Ga. App. 256, 671 S.E.2d 279 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of filing.</b> - Filing of financing statement can perfect only those interests acquired through security agreements. Tri-County Livestock Auction Co. v. Bank of Madison, 228 Ga. 325, 185 S.E.2d 393 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unperfected security interests.</b> - Surety, under master surety agreement in which bankrupt had signed as principal, could not assert priority over trustee with respect to equipment of bankrupt on basis of equitable lien upon retained contract funds following surety's completion of construction contract; without such equitable lien, surety, without perfected security interest, stood as general unsecured creditor which must defer to trustee. In re Merts Equip. Co., 438 F. Supp. 295 (M.D. Ga. 1977) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Unperfected security interest is subordinate to rights of lien creditors who acquire liens without knowledge of prior security interest and before its perfection; this operates in favor of creditor who has acquired lien on property involved by attachment, levy or the like.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Deemed unperfected security interests.</b> - Although a bank's security interests in equipment were properly perfected and remained so throughout a buyer's acquisition of the equipment from the debtor, those security interests were deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser for value when the bank failed to file timely continuation statements, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-515(b), and the buyer took free of the security interests under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-317(b) because the buyer did not have actual knowledge of the security interests. Four County Bank v. Tidewater Equip. Co., 331 Ga. App. 753, 771 S.E.2d 437 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment on note.</b> - Judgment on debt for unpaid balance on note does not in itself operate to perfect security interest in collateral listed on note, and payee's rights are subordinate to those of lien creditor who has no knowledge of security interest. Fas-Pac, Inc. v. Fillingame, 123 Ga. App. 203, 180 S.E.2d 243 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment liens are subordinate.</b> - The legislature intended to make judgment liens subordinate to purchase money security interests perfected within the grace period contained in former subsection (2) of this section. Crossroads Bank v. Corim, Inc., 262 Ga. 364, 418 S.E.2d 601 (1992) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase money security interests.</b> - A purchase money security interest has priority over a prior judgment lien only to the extent permitted by former subsection (2) of this section, which established a 15-day grace period for filing the purchase money security interest. Crossroads Bank v. Corim, Inc., 262 Ga. 364, 418 S.E.2d 601 (1992) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - Guiding principle in former subsection (1) of this section is to protect buyer in ordinary course of business from dealer against reservation of title or other hidden interest in goods. Commercial Credit Equip. Corp. v. Bates, 154 Ga. App. 71, 267 S.E.2d 469 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute was intended to protect buyers in the ordinary course</b> from the lien claims of creditors who financed floor plan arrangements for the dealer. Superior Bank, FSB v. Human Servs. Emples. Credit Union, 252 Ga. App. 489, 556 S.E.2d 155 (2001) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Protection of buyers.</b> - Buyers in ordinary course of business take free of previously perfected security interests for the sake of untrammeled commercial dealing. United States v. McCleskey Mills, Inc., 409 F.2d 1216 (5th Cir. 1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability.</b> - This provision not operative where perfection of security interest is required under Ch. 3, T. 40. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Smithloff, 119 Ga. 284, 167 S.E.2d 190 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Floor-plan financed vehicle.</b> - Where there is floor-plan financing of vehicle, perfection of security interest in inventory would come under Uniform Commercial Code and as to such security interest created by a dealer priority is governed by former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-307 (see now <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-320). Rome Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Bradshaw, 143 Ga. App. 153, 237 S.E.2d 612 (1977) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Knowledge of violation of security interest.</b> - A buyer who merely knows of a security interest of another party covering certain goods constitutes a buyer in ordinary course of business and takes free of that security interest, whereas a buyer who knows that the sale actually violates some term of the security agreement not waived by the secured party takes subject to that security interest. First Nat'l Bank v. Atlanta Classic Cars, Inc., 184 Ga. App. 784, 363 S.E.2d 16 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of collateral.</b> - Bona fide purchaser's, a corporation, purchase of a machine did not fall within an exception to the general rule that a security interest continued after the sale of the collateral, as a similar argument in Superior Bank v. Human Services Employees Credit Union, 252 Ga. App. 489, 556 S.E.2d 155 (2001) was rejected. Intermet Corp. v. Fin. Fed. Credit, Inc., 263 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase of used car from car-leasing business.</b> - Where sale of used cars upon termination of leases was merely incidental to leasing business, former subsection (1) had no application to such incidental sales and purchaser at such sale did not purchase from a person engaged in business of selling cars and was therefore not entitled to protection afforded to buyers in the ordinary course of business. United Carolina Bank v. Capital Auto. Co., 163 Ga. App. 796, 294 S.E.2d 661 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-307).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Attachment proceedings.</b> - Where plaintiffs in attachment proceedings are seeking refund of down payment after recission of contract, fact that debt is to be satisfied by execution sale of attached mobile home does not make them buyers in ordinary course of business.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining priority.</b> - Under<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>former subsection (5) determining priority involves a two-prong determination: (1) how security interest is to be perfected and (2) whether security interest has in fact been so perfected. Enterprises Now, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Dev. Corp., 135 Ga. App. 602, 218 S.E.2d 309 (1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Determining priority in destroyed property covered by insurance.</b> - Bankruptcy court found that under the security deed the credit company held a valid security interest in the destroyed property and the security deed provided sufficient language to grant the credit company a security interest in the proceeds of the collateral, including any insurance proceeds. Altegra Credit Co. v. Ford Motor Credit Co. (In re Brantley), 286 Bankr. 918 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order of filing determinative.</b> - When competing security interests are all perfected by filing, order of filing determines priority. Tuftco Sales Corp. v. Garrison Carpet Mills, Inc., 158 Ga. App. 674, 282 S.E.2d 159 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where financing statement giving notice of interest of entruster in office machines entrusted to bankrupt is signed by debtor, incorporates security agreement, and adequately describes collateral, is filed prior to filing of bank's financing statement covering inventory, equipment, furniture, and fixtures, prior security interest must prevail. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Olivetti Corp. of Am., 130 Ga. App. 896, 204 S.E.2d 781 (1974) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Perfected security interest had priority over attempted reservation of title.</b> - Peanut growers' attempted reservation of title when the growers' delivered peanuts to a peanut company at a peanut broker's direction amounted to a security interest; however, the growers never perfected their security interests. A cooperative bank's security interest in the peanuts was perfected as the grower had filed financing statements and the security interest had attached so that the bank's perfected security interest had priority over the growers' unperfected security interests. Farm Credit of Northwest Fla., ACA v. Easom Peanut Co., 312 Ga. App. 374, 718 S.E.2d 590 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0444, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 315 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Correction of errors in financing statement.</b> - Once the secured party files an effective financing statement, it is relieved, to a certain extent, of the burden of correcting misleading errors, and a prospective creditor is obligated to inquire into the debtor's source of title. Western Auto Supply Co. v. McKenzie, 227 Ga. App. 477, 489 S.E.2d 537 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security interest in check exchanged for goods.</b> - An experienced, informed seller who has sold goods in exchange for a check and who then files a security interest in the check under the former provisions of this Code section will enjoy priority over even subsequent good faith purchasers. Dixie Bonded Whse. &amp; Grain Co. v. Allstate Fin. Corp., 755 F. Supp. 1543 (M.D. Ga.), aff'd, 944 F.2d 819 (11th Cir. 1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Factor's interest in accounts receivable.</b> - Factor's interest as a good faith purchaser of a cotton buyer's accounts receivable was superior to the interests asserted by unsecured aggrieved sellers, where the factor's actions with respect to the sellers could be characterized as nothing other than honesty in fact and good faith under Article Two of the UCC. Dixie Bonded Whse. &amp; GrainGraniteville Co. v. Bleckley Lumber Co., 755 F. Supp. 1543 (M.D. Ga.), aff'd, 944 F.2d 819 (11th Cir. 1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession of collateral.</b> - For the purposes of subsection (4), a buyer takes possession at the time of the decision to buy, not at the time of technical physical possession if physical possession was obtained earlier. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc. v. CIT Group/Equipment Fin., Inc., 230 Bankr. 213 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Timely perfection of interest.</b> - Where lease agreements with option to purchase specifically dated back to the time of delivery when debtor took possession, it was held that debtor acquired possession of three scrapers for purposes of subsection (4) at the time they were delivered by seller, rather than the time that debtor and seller entered into the lease agreements for the three scrapers, and because seller did not file its financing statement on two of the scrapers within 15 days of the time debtor took possession, as required by subsection (4), seller failed to timely perfect its purchase money security interest in these two scrapers, so bank's prior security interest in equipment, including after-acquired property, had priority over seller's purchase money security interest in these two scrapers pursuant to subsection (5)(a), but because it timely perfected its purchase money security interest in the third scraper, seller had priority over the bank pursuant to subsection (4). Iron Peddlers, Inc. v. Ivie &amp; Assocs., 84 Bankr. 882 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a bank's perfected security interest in a skidder did not qualify as a purchase money security interest because the funds it lent were not used by a logging company to purchase the skidder, and where the logging company received possession and became indebted for the purchase price on the date the purchase money lender paid the seller directly, the purchase money lender was the only creditor holding a purchase money security interest, and its perfection of that interest by filing its financing statement within 15 days after the acquisition of ownership and execution by the purchaser of the note evidencing its obligation to pay the purchase price gave that purchase money lender priority.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time of notification.</b> - While 1978 "amendments" to former section made changes in notification procedure they did not effectuate change in timing of notification; that notification need not precede filing is clear, if for no other reason than that former paragraph (3)(d) contemplates that notification may state that purchase money security interest "has" been acquired in debtor's inventory. King's Appliance &amp; Elecs., Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Bank, 157 Ga. App. 857, 278 S.E.2d 733 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing may precede notification envisioned under former subsection (3) of section.</b> King's Appliance &amp; Elecs., Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Bank, 157 Ga. App. 857, 278 S.E.2d 733 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under former paragraph (3)(c) of section, notification is timely if holder of conflicting prior security interest receives it no more than five years before date debtor receives possession of inventory. King's Appliance &amp; Elecs., Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Bank, 157 Ga. App. 857, 278 S.E.2d 733 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitation on floating liens.</b> - "Floating lien" theory, by which all subsequently acquired property comes under earlier security instrument, has been approved by former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-204, however, former paragraph (4) of this section provides seller of noninventory goods under purchase money contract with right to retain priority provided the seller perfects the security interest before delivery or within ten days (now 15 days) after delivery. Babson Credit Plan, Inc. v. Cordele Prod. Credit Ass'n, 146 Ga. App. 266, 246 S.E.2d 354 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Priority between perfected and unperfected interests.</b> - Where seller of personal property which is later affixed to realty retains security interest in the goods, which is not perfected, seller's security interest attaches upon delivery and is superior to another creditor's prior perfected security interest in the personalty and "after-acquired" "personal property" and "equipment of every description" of the common debtor, when such "after-acquired" personalty is affixed to realty as fixtures. Babson Credit Plan, Inc. v. Cordele Prod. Credit Ass'n, 146 Ga. App. 266, 246 S.E.2d 354 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When status of "debtor" attaches.</b> - Buyer of cows who had milked and cared for the cows for several weeks prior to obtaining a loan for their purchase, but who did not finally decide to purchase the cows until after obtaining the loan, was not a "debtor," and did not take possession, until the loan was closed. United States v. Hooks, 40 Bankr. 715 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession of collateral.</b> - For the purposes of former subsection (4), a buyer takes possession at the time of the decision to buy, not at the time of technical physical possession if physical possession was obtained earlier. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc. v. CIT Group/Equipment Fin., Inc., 230 Bankr. 213 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1998) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Timely perfection of interest.</b> - Where lease agreements with option to purchase specifically dated back to the time of delivery when debtor took possession, it was held that debtor acquired possession of three scrapers for purposes of former subsection (4) at the time they were delivered by seller, rather than the time that debtor and seller entered into the lease agreements for the three scrapers, and because seller did not file its financing statement on two of the scrapers within 15 days of the time debtor took possession, as required by former subsection (4), seller failed to timely perfect its purchase money security interest in these two scrapers, so bank's prior security interest in equipment, including after-acquired property, had priority over seller's purchase money security interest in these two scrapers pursuant to former subsection (5)(a), but because it timely perfected its purchase money security interest in the third scraper, seller had priority over the bank pursuant to former subsection (4). Iron Peddlers, Inc. v. Ivie &amp; Assocs., 84 Bankr. 882 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-312). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a bank's perfected security interest in a skidder did not qualify as a purchase money security interest because the funds it lent were not used by a logging company to purchase the skidder, and where the logging company received possession and became indebted for the purchase price on the date the purchase money lender paid the seller directly, the purchase money lender was the only creditor holding a purchase money security interest, and its perfection of that interest by filing its financing statement within 15 days after the acquisition of ownership and execution by the purchaser of the note evidencing its obligation to pay the purchase price gave that purchase money lender priority. Citizens Bank of Americus v. Federal Fin. Servs., Inc., 235 Ga. App. 482, 509 S.E.2d 339 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Security interest unperfected.</b> - Where the creditor's security interest in vehicles was not noted on the certificates of title under Georgia's Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act, even if it was a purchase money security interest, the creditor was unperfected and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-324(a) did not apply; the debtor's bankruptcy trustee could avoid the security interests under 11 U.S.C.S. 544(a)(1).

<p class="p4"><b>General rule.</b> - The general rule in Georgia is that personal property which is actually or constructively attached to real property is considered part of the realty so that an interest arises in it under real estate law. Wright v. C &amp; S Family Credit, Inc., 128 Bankr. 838 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of fixtures.</b> - Fixture is not a separate, exclusive classification of goods, but rather a unique category of property. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Section clearly recognized that fixtures may be subject to two different types of security interest: a chattel interest and a real estate interest; and this recognition is in accord with dual nature of a fixture, a chattel which has become real property; indeed, existence of both chattel interest and real estate interest in fixtures gives rise to need for this former section which attempted to equitably resolve conflicts between these two interests. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Priority of real estate interests.</b> - Section dealt with priority of real estate interest vis-a-vis chattel interest in fixtures. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creation of real estate interests in fixtures.</b> - The former provisions of this section did not apply to creation of real estate interests in fixtures; that is a matter left to real estate law. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consumer goods may be fixtures.</b> - Former provisions of Article 9 applied to transactions creating security interests in fixtures, but only to extent that provision was made for fixtures in this section, and, considering Uniform Commercial Code's definition and classification of goods, it appears that it contemplates that consumer goods may also be fixtures at least insofar as fixtures are subject to Uniform Commercial Code under this section. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Radio tower as personal property, not fixture.</b> - Where the intention of the parties was unclear as to whether a radio tower was to be a fixture and the radio tower was bolted to concrete slabs with bolts in each of the radio tower's three legs, no guy wires secured the radio tower, the radio tower apparently could be removed from the realty without damage to the land or to the radio tower by removing these bolts and disassembling the radio tower, and the radio tower had already been removed once, the radio tower was personal property rather than a fixture. Tidwell v. Slocumb (In re Ga. Steel, Inc.), 71 Bankr. 903 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unperfected security interest in fixtures was superior.</b> - Where seller of personal property which is later affixed to realty retains security interest in goods, which is not perfected, seller's security interest attaches upon delivery and is superior to another creditor's prior deed to secure debt on same realty which has been perfected, to extent of advances made by prior creditor to common debtor before attachment of security interest of seller of personalty, but not to advances made after attachment of latter security interest. Babson Credit Plan, Inc. v. Cordele Prod. Credit Ass'n, 146 Ga. App. 266, 246 S.E.2d 354 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Character of personalty after annexation to realty.</b> - Personalty purchased under retail installment contract, which is to be attached to realty, may by specific agreement of parties retain personalty classification where it is intent of seller and the purchaser that personalty is not to become a fixture, but an "accession." Babson Credit Plan, Inc. v. Cordele Prod. Credit Ass'n, 146 Ga. App. 266, 246 S.E.2d 354 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conflict on whether goods are to become fixtures.</b> - Where personalty is sold under contract which provides that goods are to remain personal property and not become fixture, but seller checks block on financing statement that described goods are affixed or are to be affixed to certain real estate, question of intent of parties and whether goods remain personalty or became fixtures upon affixation is for the trier of fact. Babson Credit Plan, Inc. v. Cordele Prod. Credit Ass'n, 146 Ga. App. 266, 246 S.E.2d 354 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interest of security holder in fixtures not subject to summary judgment.</b> - Trial court erred by granting the landlord summary judgment on the security interest holder's claims for conversion and reasonable hire because for some reasonable period of time the tenant's interest in the trade fixture took priority over whatever interest the landlord might have received under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-7-12 when the landlord took possession of the premises; what constituted a reasonable time was not subject to summary judgment.

<p class="p4"><b>Underlying purpose</b> of this section was the establishment of purely local filing system. In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of former subsection (1)(b).</b> - Policy of former subsection (1)(b) of this section was to require filing in place or places where creditor would normally look for information concerning interests created by debtor. In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compliance.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56 to colt possessors in a tortious interference with a contract claim by a horse trainer, wherein the trainer alleged that the trainer had a contract to keep the recently born colt in exchange for continued services to the mare's owner; the court found that there was no showing that the possessors were aware of a contract regarding the ownership of the colt, the possessors had followed the necessary procedures for filing a financing statement under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-501 through 11-9-504, they had allegedly foreclosed on their lien on the mare by the time that they became aware of the trainer's claim, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-490, and the trainer did not record a lien against the colt pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-511. Medlin v. Morganstern, 268 Ga. App. 116, 601 S.E.2d 359 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Apparent intent of words "not an individual"</b> is to differentiate individual proprietorships from other business entities. Retreading Equip., Inc. v. Murphy, 5 Bankr. 596 (N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proper place to file financing statement.</b> - The proper place to file financing statement under former subsection (1)(b) of this section was county of debtor corporation's factual principal place of business. In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of "principal place of business".</b> - Failure of legislature in enacting this section to make specific reference to "principal office" concept indicates it did not intend that "principal office" of corporate charter should be equivalent to "principal place of business." In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">By using term "principal place of business" in this section, legislature intended that proper place for filing of financing statement be the "factual" principal place of business and not "principal office" as designated in corporate charter. In re Carmichael Enters., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability of negligent title researcher.</b> - Failure of law firm's title researcher to find improperly indexed deed to secure debt in personalty docket, or a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement not cross-indexed to realty docket does not make law firm for title insurer a joint tort-feasor with grantor who breaches warranty of title to grantee, as the tort is the breach of warranty and causation for such breach of warranty lies solely at hands of defendants. The law firm's delict, if any, was failure to detect defendants' delict. Pease &amp; Elliman Realty Trust v. Gaines, 160 Ga. App. 125, 286 S.E.2d 448 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Harvested peanut crops.</b> - Plaintiffs' filing of their financing statement in the proper county gave defendant legal notice of plaintiffs' security interests and liens in peanut crops defendant purchased, even though the clerk incorrectly recorded the financing statement, and the perfected security interests remained effective even though the crops were harvested. Bartolan, Inc. v. Columbian Peanut Co., 727 F. Supp. 1444 (M.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to financing statements, not security agreements.</b> - Requirement that identification of collateral indicate type of collateral is applicable to financing statements, not security agreements. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 242 Ga. 388, 249 S.E.2d 72 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Type" of collateral construed.</b> - This section allowed a secured party to file a financing statement which describes the property only by its "type." A type of collateral is, for example, goods, accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles, etc. Woodrum v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 940 F.2d 1507 (11th Cir. 1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question of fact as to whether financing statement seriously misleading.</b> - In a suit involving the defendant defaulting on loans secured by property that was allegedly tortuously converted by sale, the grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff was reversed, in part, because an issue of material fact remained as to whether the financing statement was valid as to the name provided on the financing statement and whether the incorrect name made the statement seriously misleading. Rebel Auction Co. v. Citizens Bank, 343 Ga. App. 81, 805 S.E.2d 913 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security interest not perfected.</b> - Where a search of the county records did not reveal a financing statement due to a mistake in the name of the debtor shown on the financing statement, the security interest in the funds relating to the financing statement was not perfected, and the money was awarded to a judgment creditor in an interpleader action. Receivables Purchasing Co. v. R &amp; R Directional Drilling, L.L.C., 263 Ga. App. 649, 588 S.E.2d 831 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because an attorney who handled a closing in the capacity of an escrow agent for the client's business had no actual or constructive notice of a creditor's security interest in the business due to the improper filing pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-502, 11-9-503, and 11-9-506, because the debtor's name was not properly listed and the interest was accordingly not perfected, claims as to conversion of the business closing proceeds failed. All Bus. Corp. v. Choi, 280 Ga. App. 618, 634 S.E.2d 400 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Perfection of security interest in the debtor's accounts receivable granted under the agreements was not properly perfected because neither of the two elements required for perfection by Georgia law was met: first, the debtor's name as listed in the financing statement was inconsistent with its legal name on the public record, and moreover, a search of Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority's Lien records for the debtor's correct name would not have disclosed the financing statement's existence; second, the financing statement did not indicate that the statement covered all assets or all personal property of the debtor, and the statement failed to provide a description of, or reasonably identify, the debtor's accounts receivable subject to the security interest.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Name of debtor required.</b> - This section contemplates a financing statement which shows name of debtor. Citizens Bank v. Ansley, 467 F. Supp. 51 (M.D. Ga.), aff'd, 604 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Name indicated on driver's license.</b> - Name "indicated on the driver's license" refers only to the name typed on the driver's license and does not include the name signed by the debtor. Pierce v. Farm Bureau Bank (In re Pierce), 581 Bankr. 912 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security interest not perfected.</b> - Where a search of the county records did not reveal a financing statement due to a mistake in the name of the debtor shown on the financing statement, the security interest in the funds relating to the financing statement was not perfected, and the money was awarded to a judgment creditor in an interpleader action. Receivables Purchasing Co. v. R &amp; R Directional Drilling, L.L.C., 263 Ga. App. 649, 588 S.E.2d 831 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because an attorney who handled a closing in the capacity of an escrow agent for the client's business had no actual or constructive notice of a creditor's security interest in the business due to the improper filing pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-502, 11-9-503, and 11-9-506, because the debtor's name was not properly listed and the interest was accordingly not perfected, claims as to conversion of the business closing proceeds failed. All Bus. Corp. v. Choi, 280 Ga. App. 618, 634 S.E.2d 400 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debtor's name only in trade name form.</b> - Financing statement showing debtor's name only in unregistered trade name form is not legally sufficient to create security interest. In re Firth, 363 F. Supp. 369 (M.D. Ga. 1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Filing of a financing statement under a corporate debtor's trade name, was sufficient, where business was done under the trade name and any reasonably prudent creditor would have searched the records under that name. In re Simpson Motor Co., 101 Bankr. 813 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Creditor's filing of a financing statement on the debtor's automobiles in the debtor's trade name rather than its legal name was sufficient, even though the creditor knew the legal name but decided not to file under it, where the debtor did business only under one trade name. Willson v. Habersham Bank, 111 Bankr. 368 (N.D. Ga. 1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signature material aspect of financing statement.</b> - Unless former subsection (2) of this section applies, the debtor's signature is a material aspect of the financing statement. USI Capital &amp; Leasing v. Medical Oxygen Serv., Inc., 36 Bankr. 341 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signature by real debtor in individual capacity on behalf of fictitious entity.</b> - Where real debtor has not signed financing statement in his individual capacity, but only on behalf of fictitious business entity, it is conceptually insufficient since signature of real debtor in his real name does not appear thereon. In re Firth, 363 F. Supp. 369 (M.D. Ga. 1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fictitious signature is insufficient notice to subsequent creditors.</b> - While this section has effect of binding those persons who contract in fictitious names to contracts, so executed, it does not have effect of saying that financing statements given in fictitious names are sufficient to notify subsequent creditors of identity of party using the fictitious name. Were a court to hold otherwise, the purpose of statutory scheme of requiring security interest to be perfected by filing a financing statement - to give notice to future creditors of debtor - would be seriously undermined. In re Firth, 363 F. Supp. 369 (M.D. Ga. 1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signatures required for amendments.</b> - Section was amended in 1978 specifically to require signatures of debtors to amendments to financing statements. Walter E. Heller &amp; Co. v. Aetna Bus. Credit, Inc., 158 Ga. App. 249, 280 S.E.2d 144 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question of fact as to whether financing statement seriously misleading.</b> - In a suit involving the defendant defaulting on loans secured by property that was allegedly tortuously converted by sale, the grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff was reversed, in part, because an issue of material fact remained as to whether the financing statement was valid as to the name provided on the financing statement and whether the incorrect name made the statement seriously misleading. Rebel Auction Co. v. Citizens Bank, 343 Ga. App. 81, 805 S.E.2d 913 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to file amended financing statement.</b> - Where creditor failed to file an amended financing statement reflecting debtor's name change, its original filing was not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by debtor more than four months after it changed its name. Pettigrew v. Consultants United, Inc. (In re Specialcare, Inc.), 209 Bankr. 13 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1997) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First lienholder still protected despite error in financing statement.</b> - Even assuming a financing statement became seriously misleading due to a change in the debtor's name after dissolution of the corporation, the first lienholder was still protected as to collateral acquired through that time and up to four months thereafter. Western Auto Supply Co. v. McKenzie, 227 Ga. App. 477, 489 S.E.2d 537 (1997) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Listing name of debtor's farm, not debtor's name.</b> - Erroneously listing name of debtor's purported farm, rather than debtor's name, on security agreement is seriously misleading to subsequent creditors, and, as such, renders creditor's security interest in property so listed unperfected. Citizens Bank v. Ansley, 467 F. Supp. 51 (M.D. Ga.), aff'd, 604 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistake in name of debtor.</b> - Where a search of the county records did not reveal a financing statement due to a mistake in the name of the debtor shown on the financing statement, the security interest in the funds relating to the financing statement was not perfected, and the money was awarded to a judgment creditor in an interpleader action. Receivables Purchasing Co. v. R &amp; R Directional Drilling, L.L.C., 263 Ga. App. 649, 588 S.E.2d 831 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Erroneous listing of agent, rather than owner.</b> - Financing statement which erroneously listed the agent of the owner of rented land upon which secured crops were grown, rather than listing the actual owner, was not seriously misleading, and was therefore effective. United States v. Georgia Vegetables Co., 123 Bankr. 456 (M.D. Ga. 1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Creditor's filing of financing statements under debtor's trade name only</b> rather than under the debtor's legal, corporate name was seriously misleading and insufficient to perfect a security interest, where potential creditors would have been misled due to the name by which the debtor was listed in the financing statements.

<p class="p4"><b>First lienholder still protected despite error in financing statement.</b> - Even assuming a financing statement became seriously misleading due to a change in the debtor's name after dissolution of the corporation, the first lienholder was still protected as to collateral acquired through that time and up to four months thereafter. Western Auto Supply Co. v. McKenzie, 227 Ga. App. 477, 489 S.E.2d 537 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer of collateral.</b> - Where the financing statement was effective when it named "King's Tuft" as the debtor but the collateral was subsequently transferred to "Cohutta Mills," the statement became seriously misleading: because the two names were completely dissimilar, a searcher of "Cohutta Mills'" interests would not be alerted to inquire into "King's Tuft's" interests. Jones v. Small Bus. Admin. (In re Cohutta Mills, Inc.), 108 Bankr. 815 (N.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Filing continuation statement.</b> - Upon the lapse of a seriously misleading, though partially effective, financing statement, the secured party, acting in good faith, must file a continuation statement under the new debtor's name if it wishes to sustain its perfected status.

<p class="p4"><b>Question of fact as to whether financing statement seriously misleading.</b> - In a suit involving the defendant defaulting on loans secured by property that was allegedly tortuously converted by sale, the grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff was reversed, in part, because an issue of material fact remained as to whether the financing statement was valid as to the name provided on the financing statement and whether the incorrect name made the statement seriously misleading.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Harvested peanut crops.</b> - Plaintiffs' filing of their financing statement in the proper county gave defendant legal notice of plaintiffs' security interests and liens in peanut crops defendant purchased, even though the clerk incorrectly recorded the financing statement, and the perfected security interests remained effective even though the crops were harvested. Bartolan, Inc. v. Columbian Peanut Co., 727 F. Supp. 1444 (M.D. Ga. 1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Document identified in handwriting as an "amendment,"</b> which contained a property description that varied markedly from that contained in the original financing statement and was signed by both the secured party's representative and the debtor's representative, was not merely mislabeled due to clerical error and was not legally effective as a continuation statement. Kubota Tractor Corp. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 198 Ga. App. 830, 403 S.E.2d 218 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of continuation statements.</b> - Former subsection (3) worked to allow filing officers (Superior Court Clerks) to refuse to accept continuation statements until the last 6 months of the previous filing's effectiveness. Once the new filing is accepted, however, it is in force for a period of five years, not from the filing date of the financing statement, but from the date of the filing of the new statement, under former subsection (8). In re Rainbow Mfg. Co., 150 Bankr. 857 (M.D. Ga. 1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Continuation statement filed by a secured creditor prior to the six-month period set forth in former subsection (3) was effective for five years from the date of filing and extended the creditor's security interest in certain assets of the debtor beyond the original period of protection. Coats Am., Inc. v. Summit Nat'l Bank, 211 Bankr. 771 (N.D. Ga 1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Second financing statement considered back-up, not continuation or amendment of original.</b> - A second financing statement filed by the same creditor covering the same collateral could not be considered a continuation statement under this section, or an amendment to the original under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-402 (see now <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-502 et seq.), but was deemed to be a back-up financing statement with its own separately established priority, and, where the debtor's bankruptcy petition was filed while the first financing statement was still effective, creditor's first-in time priority status under the original statement was preserved. Giddens v. Pioneer Credit, 205 Bankr. 349 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of fixture filing.</b> - Under Georgia law, a fixture filing contained sufficient information to put a purchaser on notice of the existence of a bond trustee's prior unrecorded interest in the real property under an indenture, and the references in the fixture filing to the assignment and pledge of the debtor's interest would excite the attention of a purchaser and trigger the duty to inquire further into the interest held by the bond trustee. That inquiry would include an examination of the indenture that would give the purchaser notice of the bond trustee's mortgage and, thus, the mortgage lien was enforceable against a bona fide purchaser, and the mortgage lien was not avoidable under the Bankruptcy Code. Detention Mgmt., LLC v. UMB Bank, NA (In re Mun. Corr., LLC), 501 Bankr. 119 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>A loan, null and void as a matter of law,</b> creates no "outstanding secured obligation," whether or not declared to be null and void by order of court. United States Life Credit Corp. v. Johnson, 248 Ga. 852, 287 S.E.2d 1 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loan agreement language held insufficient to terminate.</b> - Although the provisions of a subsequent loan agreement stated: "It is understood that this Loan Agreement supersedes and cancels any previous Loan Agreements," this language did not cancel the security agreements or financial statements previously executed by the parties, but merely served to consolidate the previous loan agreements between the parties, and where instead of filing a termination statement, creditor filed a continuation statement, continuing the earlier financing statement, the creditor's security interest, perfected earlier in debtor's equipment, was still valid and effective. Tidwell v. Slocumb (In re Ga. Steel, Inc.), 71 Bankr. 903 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award of damages held proper.</b> - Where industrial loan was void from its inception as usurious, it created no "outstanding secured obligation," and an order by the trial court awarding damages under this section was proper where the lender refused to provide a termination statement that he no longer claimed a security interest under the financing statement. United States Life Credit Corp. v. Johnson, 161 Ga. App. 864, 290 S.E.2d 280 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The five-year period begins on day of filing.</b> - The time computation would be made from the filing day and would expire on midnight of the day preceding the anniversary date of filing. In order to be effective, any continuation statement would have to be filed within six months prior to expiration of the five-year period. Harrelson Rubber Co. v. Super Treads, Inc., 7 Bankr. 532 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing continuation statement.</b> - Upon the lapse of a seriously misleading, though partially effective, financing statement, the secured party, acting in good faith, must file a continuation statement under the new debtor's name if it wishes to sustain its perfected status. Jones v. Small Bus. Admin. (In re Cohutta Mills, Inc.), 108 Bankr. 815 (N.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to file timely continuation statement.</b> - Although a bank's security interests in equipment were properly perfected and remained so throughout a buyer's acquisition of the equipment from the debtor, those security interests were deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser for value when the bank failed to file timely continuation statements, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-515(b), and the buyer took free of the security interests under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-317(b) because the buyer did not have actual knowledge of the security interests. Four County Bank v. Tidewater Equip. Co., 331 Ga. App. 753, 771 S.E.2d 437 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Harvested peanut crops.</b> - Plaintiffs' filing of their financing statement in the proper county gave defendant legal notice of plaintiffs' security interests and liens in peanut crops defendant purchased, even though the clerk incorrectly recorded the financing statement, and the perfected security interests remained effective even though the crops were harvested. Bartolan, Inc. v. Columbian Peanut Co., 727 F. Supp. 1444 (M.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former subsection (8) was intended to save financing and continuation statements</b> that had been filed in conformity with the 1985 amendments to Article 9. Only secured parties who had failed to continue their perfected security interest, and secured creditors whose security interest had legitimately expired were not continued, or saved, by operation of law. In re Rainbow Mfg. Co., 150 Bankr. 857 (M.D. Ga. 1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of filings under prior law.</b> - Bank was properly perfected as a result of the filing of its financing statement and continuation statement. Former subsection (8) continued the continuation statement for a period of five years, regardless of the stated maturity date on the form. As a result of these acts, the bank would be perfected until five years after the continuation statement was filed. In re Rainbow Mfg. Co., 150 Bankr. 857 (M.D. Ga. 1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of continuation statements.</b> - Former subsection (3) worked to allow filing officers (Superior Court Clerks) to refuse to accept continuation statements until the last 6 months of the previous filing's effectiveness. Once the new filing is accepted, however, it is in force for a period of five years, not from the filing date of the financing statement, but from the date of the filing of the new statement, under former subsection (8). In re Rainbow Mfg. Co., 150 Bankr. 857 (M.D. Ga. 1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Continuation statement filed by a secured creditor prior to the six-month period set forth in former subsection (3) was effective for five years from the date of filing and extended the creditor's security interest in certain assets of the debtor beyond the original period of protection. Coats Am., Inc. v. Summit Nat'l Bank, 211 Bankr. 771 (N.D. Ga 1997) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Second financing statement considered back-up, not continuation or amendment of original.</b> - A second financing statement filed by the same creditor covering the same collateral could not be considered a continuation statement under this former section, or an amendment to the original under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-402, but was deemed to be a back-up financing statement with its own separately established priority, and, where the debtor's bankruptcy petition was filed while the first financing statement was still effective, creditor's first-in time priority status under the original statement was preserved.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of remedies provided in this article.</b> - The former provisions set forth general remedies of both creditor and debtor while remaining provisions of Art. 9 simply elaborated on the various remedies summarized herein, and as such, are neither mandatory nor mutually exclusive. McCullough v. Mobiland, Inc., 139 Ga. App. 260, 228 S.E.2d 146 (1976) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of former subsection (4).</b> - The last clause of former subsection (4) ("in which case the provisions of this part do not apply") is itself applicable only where the creditor proceeds "as to both the real and the personal property in accordance with his rights and remedies in respect of the real property . . . ", where the creditor sells the debtor's personalty pursuant to debtor's notes and security agreement and seeks to proceed against the debtor's guarantor's real estate for the balance pursuant to their deed. United States ex rel. FHA v. Kennedy, 256 Ga. 345, 348 S.E.2d 636 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing suit after repossession without first disposing of collateral.</b> - Secured creditor's election to repossess collateral and then to file suit on contract without first disposing of the collateral was not improper under the terms of the sale contracts or of the UCC. ITT Terryphone Corp. v. Modems Plus, Inc., 171 Ga. App. 710, 320 S.E.2d 784 (1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-501). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank, a secured creditor, that brought an action for money judgment on a note while holding the collateral pledged by a corporation and an individual because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-601(c) and 11-9-609(a)(1) allowed a secured creditor in possession of a debtor's collateral to employ a number of different remedial steps until the debt was satisfied.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standard for determining default to be determined contractually.</b> - Since there is no definition per se of what constitutes default within purview of Uniform Commercial Code, this is one of those standards to be determined by parties contractually. Borochoff Properties, Inc. v. Howard Lumber Co., 115 Ga. App. 691, 155 S.E.2d 651 (1967) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standards for determining whether there has been default.</b> - This title does not specifically define "default" under a security agreement. For the most part, the security agreement itself must define standards for determining whether default occurs. Whisenhunt v. Allen Parker Co., 119 Ga. App. 813, 168 S.E.2d 827 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of "indebtedness".</b> - Although security agreement authorizing creditor to collect debtor's receivables "for application on the indebtedness hereby secured" was authorized by the former provisions of this section, the term "indebtedness" as used<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>does not include unmatured balance of loan, since such a construction would effectively permit acceleration of indebtedness without default and at whim of the lender, at least to extent of receivables.

<p class="p4"><b>The apparent reason for the requirement of commercial reasonableness</b> in former subsection (2) of this section (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-607(c)) is to assure, where the secured assignee of receivables undertakes to collect on accounts, that the assignee act with the same degree of prudence which the original account creditor would exercise.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Factoring agreement takes precedence over commercial reasonableness standard.</b> - Where an accounts receivable factor in no way undertook to collect factored accounts, but rather, by the express terms of the factoring agreement, the duty of collection was placed exclusively upon the debtor and this is an agreement between merchants dealing at arms' length, with consideration flowing to both sides, there is no obstacle to leaving the duty of collection with the debtor, and the debtor may not rely on the standard of commercial reasonableness embodied in former subsection (2) of this section (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-607 (c)), but must look to the terms of the factoring agreement.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Repossession though another holds legal title by bill of sale.</b> - This former section, which made provision as to right of holder of security instrument to possession of chattel upon default by maker, permits one who has right of possession to recover property from one who wrongfully deprives the right holder of possession, although a third person may hold legal title by bill of sale to secure debt. Chastain v. Consol. Credit Corp., 113 Ga. App. 225, 147 S.E.2d 807, later appeal, 114 Ga. App. 474, 151 S.E.2d 889 (1966) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession proper.</b> - Summary judgment was properly entered for a credit union on an owner's claim for wrongful possession as the owner defaulted on the owner's agreement with the credit union by failing to pay the storage fees for the car, which resulted in a garageman's lien; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-601(a), as the owner was in default, the credit union could, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-609(a), take possession of the collateral, and under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-610, the credit union could sell it. Endsley v. Robins Fed. Credit Union, 267 Ga. App. 512, 600 S.E.2d 441 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to title.</b> - This former section gave broad rights to a secured party to repossess the secured property in order to sell or otherwise dispose of it upon default. At the time that a secured party forecloses on the secured property, it obtains the right of possession, not absolute title. Jeweler's Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Chapes, Ltd., 181 Ga. App. 872, 354 S.E.2d 200 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constructive possession.</b> - It was unnecessary for the creditor to exercise actual physical control of an automobile in order to repossess it. Rather, the creditor could, and did, repossess the automobile by taking constructive possession of it. Avery v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 194 Ga. App. 682, 391 S.E.2d 410 (1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remedy for breach.</b> - A breach of peace by the creditor does not bar all recovery on a debt. Rather, the remedy available to the debtor for creditor's misbehavior is recovery in tort for damages incurred. Emmons v. Burkett, 179 Ga. App. 838, 348 S.E.2d 323 (1986), rev'd on other grounds, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suing on contract after repossession but prior to selling collateral.</b> - Secured creditor's election to repossess collateral and then to file suit on contract without first disposing of the collateral was not improper under the terms of the sale contracts or of the UCC. ITT Terryphone Corp. v. Modems Plus, Inc., 171 Ga. App. 710, 320 S.E.2d 784 (1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank, a secured creditor, that brought an action for money judgment on a note while holding the collateral pledged by a corporation and an individual because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-601(c) and 11-9-609(a)(1) allowed a secured creditor in possession of a debtor's collateral to employ a number of different remedial steps until the debt was satisfied. Okefenokee Aircraft, Inc. v. Primesouth Bank, 296 Ga. App. 782, 676 S.E.2d 394 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach of the peace.</b> - Where plaintiff's asserted abduction during the course of having plaintiff's car repossessed was unrefuted in the record, it could not be said as a matter of law that defendants' alleged conduct did not amount to a breach of the peace. Roach v. Barclays-American/Credit, Inc., 164 Ga. App. 616, 298 S.E.2d 304 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The Court of Appeals could not say as a matter of law that creditor's entry into the business premises was in breach of the peace since, because debtor was not present at the time, there was no evidence of "accompanying incitement to immediate violence," nor "unequivocal oral protest of the defaulting debtor." Emmons v. Burkett, 179 Ga. App. 838, 348 S.E.2d 323 (1986), rev'd on other grounds, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action by a debtor against a creditor-bank, recovery service, and independent contractor hired by the recovery service to repossess the debtor's car, circumstances of debtor's resistance to the seizure by the contractor created genuine issues of material fact as to the debtor's claim for breach of the peace, and both the bank and recovery service could be held liable for damages based on a finding that the contractor breached the peace. Fulton v. Anchor Sav. Bank, 215 Ga. App. 456, 452 S.E.2d 208 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of a creditor as to whether it could be held vicariously liable for an independent contractor's acts in attempting to repossess a debtor's car because the creditor had a non-delegable statutory duty under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-609 to not breach the peace in repossessing the car, and if the contractor's attempt to repossess the car was in violation of the statute, the creditor would be chargeable with that conduct since it was done in violation of a duty imposed upon it by statute; there is nothing in <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-609 that allows a secured party to avoid liability for a wrongful repossession by simply delegating this duty to an independent contractor. Lewis v. Nicholas Fin., Inc., 300 Ga. App. 888, 686 S.E.2d 468 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Pre-default rights waiver ineffective.</b> - Guarantor's waiver of an affirmative defense of commercial unreasonability prior to a debtor's default on a loan made in participation with business organization was ineffective since pre-default waiver of rights under was invalid under the former provisions. United States v. Contestabile, 989 F.2d 463 (11th Cir. 1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Self help has always been part of common law</b> without use of state power. Shelton v. GECC, 359 F. Supp. 1079 (M.D. Ga. 1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Secured party responsible for tortious acts committed by agents.</b> - Although secured party, through its agents, has right to peacefully enter premises and obtain its property, secured party is responsible for any tortious acts committed during repossession. Whisenhunt v. Allen Parker Co., 119 Ga. App. 813, 168 S.E.2d 827 (1969) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Threats by agents to defaulting party.</b> - Threats to have plaintiffs arrested if they did not disclose the location of a vehicle they purchased to individuals who were hired to repossess the vehicle were insufficient by themselves to show that the individuals making the statements violated former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-503. Cornelius v. Nuvell Fin. Servs. Corp., 256 Ga. App. 171, 568 S.E.2d 82 (2002) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-503).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Absence of the debtor's knowledge or consent to repossession does not constitute a breach of the peace unless abusive and insulting language which incites violence is used or some other violation of the public peace, order, or decorum occurs.

<p class="p4"><b>Notice prior to repossession.</b> - Notice is not required prior to repossession absent prior agreement to the contrary. Fulton Nat'l Bank v.

<p class="p4"><b>Notice where creditor indicates he will accept late payments.</b> - If creditor has given debtor reasonable impression that late payments will be accepted or that an arrearage need not be paid immediately, then creditor may be estopped to engage in self-help repossession until the creditor has given notice, demanded payment or otherwise indicated to debtor that the debtor is considered to be in default.

<p class="p4"><b>Notice required where contract preempted by federal law.</b> - A mobile home financing contract which was silent with regard to foreclosure and repossession did not permit the creditor to repossess by self help without notice, or to foreclose upon seven-days notice pursuant to a writ of possession (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-232), for the simple reason that the parties intended to enter a contract preempted by federal law, which requires 30 days notice to a defaulting debtor prior to repossession or foreclosure. Grant v. GECC, 764 F.2d 1404 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1124, 106 S. Ct. 1993, 90 L.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section inapplicable to sales by court appointed receivers.</b> - Whenever sale of collateral is not by secured party, but by receiver appointed by court of equity, the former provisions were not applicable to the transaction. Sands v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 146 Ga. App. 853, 247 S.E.2d 544 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section inapplicable where debt extinguished as provided by instrument.</b> - Where the terms of the deed to secure debt allowed for early payment of the debt, by accepting grantor of deed's payoff, the plaintiff simply allowed the debt evidenced by the deed to secure debt to be extinguished in a manner contemplated by that instrument, and that act does not constitute a disposition or sale of the collateral within the meaning of the former provisions. Griffith v. First Fed. Sav. Bank, 208 Ga. App. 863, 432 S.E.2d 606 (1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section inapplicable where no evidence of sale.</b> - Where neither the affidavits nor any other matter or pleading presented by the defendants identified any specific, probative evidence of a sale by the secured party, the former provisions of this section did not apply. Congress Fin. Corp. v. Commercial Technology, Inc., 910 F. Supp. 637 (N.D. Ga. 1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale commercially reasonable.</b> - Trial court did not err in concluding that a credit union's sale of a car was done in a commercially reasonable manner under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-610(b) where: (1) the car had been vandalized, including the stripping of its interior; (2) the car was not drivable; (3) a Texas credit union attempted to sell the car to its membership for eight weeks without results; (4) the credit union then contacted more than three body shops seeking a bid on the car; and (5) only one shop responded, and that bid was accepted. Endsley v. Robins Fed. Credit Union, 267 Ga. App. 512, 600 S.E.2d 441 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a bank utilized professionals in the industry to assist in the sale of the debtor's equipment, and it did not rush to dispose of the equipment, but ultimately sold it to the person whom the debtor and its guarantor contended would most likely tender the highest bid for the equipment, the sale was conducted in a commercially reasonable manner under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 11-9-627(b) and 11-9-610. AKA Mgmt. v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co., 275 Ga. App. 615, 621 S.E.2d 576 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assuming that the sale of collateral was a public sale within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-201(31.1), the sale occurred in a commercially reasonable manner, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-627, because the sale was consistent with the reasonable commercial practices of dealers in similar equipment. Moreover, the sale qualified as a valid private sale under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-613 and the creditor did not have to comply with the statute's public-sale provisions regarding time and advertising. Colonial Pac. Leasing Corp. v. N &amp; N Partners, LLC, 981 F. Supp. 2d 1345 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 4, 2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Issue of fact as to commercial reasonableness of sale.</b> - Evidence from an owner of an equipment purchaser, who had 22 years of experience in the industry and who claimed that a finance company's sale of equipment upon repossession did not bring the equipment's full value, raised a genuine issue of fact as to commercial reasonableness; accordingly, a grant of summary judgment to the finance company on the company's claim for a deficiency judgment was error. Mason Logging Co. v. GE Capital Corp., 322 Ga. App. 708, 746 S.E.2d 180 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Value of collateral customarily sold in recognized market is readily ascertainable.</b> - For collateral to qualify as collateral of a type customarily sold in recognized market so as to authorize purchase by secured party at private sale, it must be such that its value at any given time is readily ascertainable, as in case of stocks and bonds or other negotiable instruments. Luxurest Furn. Mfg. Co. v. Furniture Whse. Sales, Inc., 132 Ga. App. 661, 209 S.E.2d 63 (1974), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Gurwitch v. Luxurest Furn. Mfg. Co., 233 Ga. 934, 214 S.E.2d 373 (1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of fair and reasonable value insufficient.</b> - Documents in evidence showing only the sale price of the car were insufficient to establish the car's fair and reasonable value. No witness testified as to the basis for the opinion or opined that the appraised value of the car was the car's fair and reasonable value in that market at the time of the repossession or the sale. Versey v. Citizens Trust Bank, 306 Ga. App. 479, 702 S.E.2d 479 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Knowledge of purchaser as prerequisite for setting aside sale.</b> - Allegations that sheriff misled the attorneys of plaintiff in fieria facias as to when foreclosure sale was to be held may be insufficient grounds to set sale aside, unless it appears that purchaser knew of or had some hand in the misleading. American Sec. Inv. Co. v. Popell, 114 Ga. App. 268, 150 S.E.2d 697 (1966) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charges imposable in event of default.</b> - Security agreement may impose various charges, not found in promissory note, in event of default. General Fin. Corp. v. Sprouse, 577 F.2d 989 (5th Cir. 1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remedies are cumulative.</b> - The remedies available to creditor under the former provisions<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are cumulative and creditor is not required to be reduced to the position of unsecured creditor so long as the creditor acts in a commercially reasonable manner and does not, by the creditor's actions or omissions, further impair position of debtor. Henderson Few &amp; Co. v. Rollins Communications, Inc., 148 Ga. App. 139, 250 S.E.2d 830 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Creditor can elect either a public or private sale.</b> First Nat'l Bank v. Rivercliff Hdwe., Inc., 161 Ga. App. 259, 287 S.E.2d 701 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defenses assertable.</b> - Surety or guarantor may assert all defenses, except personal defenses, available to principal. Vickers v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 158 Ga. App. 434, 280 S.E.2d 842 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Absent waiver or estoppel there is no reason why guarantor may not assert "commercially reasonable" defense which would be available to guarantor's principal, the debtor, in an action by secured party against guarantor for deficiency judgment. Vickers v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 158 Ga. App. 434, 280 S.E.2d 842 (1981); Clay v. Presidential Fin. Corp., 175 Ga. App. 226, 332 S.E.2d 924 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Branan v. Equico Lessors, Inc., 256 Ga. 23, 342 S.E.2d 671 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Buyer not complying with terms of sale.</b> - The security interest of the mortgagee of a mobile home retail installment sales contract was not discharged by a sale to the mobile home dealer by the mortgagee following default by the purchasers where the mortgagee and the dealer agreed that the title to the mobile home was to be transferred to the dealer only after it had paid mortgagee for the mobile home, the dealer did not complete payment for the mobile home, and there was no transfer of the certificate of title or ownership interest to the dealer, nor was there need prior to the resale of the mobile home for the mortgagee to secure a new certificate of title. Sunnyland Employees' Fed. Credit Union v. Fort Wayne Mtg. Co., 182 Ga. App. 5, 354 S.E.2d 645 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery on other notes between same parties.</b> - Where suit on three promissory notes was not for deficiency judgment on debt for which foreclosure was had, but was action to recover on separate, subsequent and different notes, made for different debts, which were separate transactions, plaintiff-creditor's failure to give proper notice of sale of personal property listed in security agreements and bills of sale executed to secure first five promissory notes not included in instant suit did not extinguish entire debt of defendant-debtor. Jerkins v. Savannah Valley Prod. Credit Ass'n, 157 Ga. App. 652, 278 S.E.2d 431 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No default occurred where no request for payment was made.</b> - No default occurred where, although the evidence presented at trial showed that defendant had defaulted under the terms of the note with plaintiff at the time grantor of deed sought to pay off defendant's debt, there was no evidence presented that plaintiff requested or required that grantor of deed pay off the debt evidenced by the deed to secure debt. Griffith v. First Fed. Sav. Bank, 208 Ga. App. 863, 432 S.E.2d 606 (1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disposition of realty.</b> - When a creditor disposes of realty, strict compliance with the confirmation provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-160 et seq. is not required in order for a deficiency to be recovered, and the cases calling for strict compliance with former subsection (3) of the former provisions as to a creditor's disposition of personalty and dealing more specifically with the notice requirements of former subsection (3) rather than with any requirement similar to confirmation of a real property foreclosure, do not effectively overrule it. Business Dev. Corp. v. Bickerstaff, 73 Bankr. 421 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Leases.</b> - The commercially reasonable sale provision and the notice provision under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-36 were not applicable to a lease which was a "true lease" rather than a disguised secured transaction. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 188 Ga. App. 312, 372 S.E.2d 687 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absolute bar rule.</b> - These code provisions do not require the imposition of an absolute-bar rule and the absolute-bar rule is contrary to the intent of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-106 which expressly prohibits penal damages. Emmons v. Burkett, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notification of intent to sell at private sale prerequisite to recovery.</b> - Compliance with requirement of notification of debtor of intention to sell collateral at private sale is condition precedent to recovery of any deficiency between sale price of collateral and amount of unpaid balance. Edmondson v. Air Serv. Co., 123 Ga. App. 263, 180 S.E.2d 589 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a debtor filed a petition for bankruptcy and a creditor filed a complaint for relief from the automatic stay, which was granted, and then the creditor repossessed the debtor's car, in which it held a security interest, and sold the car but did not give prior notification of the sale to the debtor in compliance with former subsection (3) of these provisions, the creditor was not entitled to collect any deficiency. Fidelity Nat'l Bank v. Winslow, 39 Bankr. 869 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No "deficiency" where items cannot be repossessed.</b> - Where the evidence showed the sum sought represented the amount advanced to defendants on those inventory items which could not be repossessed because they had been sold "out of trust," and where these items were not, and could not have been, repossessed by plaintiff, no "deficiency" was deemed to be sought and the former provisions were not applicable. Dixon v. Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp., 186 Ga. App. 843, 368 S.E.2d 800 (1988) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale must allow debtor to exercise redemption right.</b> - Act of secured party, in selling collateral without strict compliance with notice of sale provisions of this former section precludes purchaser or owner from exercising right of redemption under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-506, and for that reason secured party cannot recover for deficiency owed by purchaser. Braswell v. American Nat'l Bank, 117 Ga. App. 699, 161 S.E.2d 420 (1968) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Deficiency admitted by failure to respond to requests to admissions.</b> - In a finance corporation's suit to recover a deficiency balance on an installment sales contract for a log loader, the trial court properly granted the corporation summary judgment upon concluding that no genuine issues of material fact existed based on the defending trucking company and the company's president failing to answer the requests for admissions that were served simultaneously with the complaint. By failing to respond and never challenging the trial court's denial of the motion to withdraw the admissions filed by the trucking company and the company's president, the following allegations were deemed admitted: that true and correct copies of the relevant documents, including the demand for payment were received; that the president executed the installment sales contract and the guaranty; that the president failed to make payments thereunder; that the principal balance due under the contract and guaranty was $34,442.44 as of a certain date; and that the money was owed to the finance corporation.

For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No federal presumption.</b> - Section's requirement of notice of sale is not preempted by federal regulations not providing specific notice requirements and which are intended to accommodate state procedures. United States ex rel. Farmers Home Admin. v. Kennedy, 785 F.2d 1553 (11th Cir. 1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relation to O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>10-1-36. - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-36 complements the former provisions and provides some guidance as to what constitutes reasonable notice. Lacy v. General Fin. Corp., 651 F.2d 1026 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effort secured party must exert in locating and notifying debtor.</b> - See Henson v. Foremost Ins. Co., 158 Ga. App. 441, 280 S.E.2d 848 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section requires giving, not receipt, of reasonable notice.</b> - The former provisions required that seller give buyer reasonable notification of intended sale. However, requirement involved is one of creditor giving debtor reasonable notification as distinguished from debtor receiving such notification. Friddell v. Rawlins, 160 Ga. App. 44, 285 S.E.2d 779 (1981); Brewer v. Trust Co. Bank, 205 Ga. App. 891, 424 S.E.2d 74 (1992) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Non-misleading notice, complying with this section, is sufficient.</b> - Notice which was in accord with requirements of former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-504(3), and which was not such as misled or prevented debtor from exercising the right of redemption under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-506, is sufficient to reasonably notify debtor of rights. Motor Contract Co. v. Sawyer, 123 Ga. App. 207, 180 S.E.2d 282 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notices sent to debtors by certified mail</b> are sufficient. Brinson v. Commercial Bank, 138 Ga. App. 177, 225 S.E.2d 701 (1976), overruled on other grounds, Barbree v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When notification is "sent" within meaning of section.</b> - These provisions relied on presumption of actual notice arising by proof that letter was written, properly stamped, properly addressed and properly mailed. Notification is not "sent" where these procedures are not observed. Edmondson v. Air Serv. Co., 123 Ga. App. 263, 180 S.E.2d 589 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Letter returned to creditor stamped "unclaimed" and "postage due".</b> - Where it appears that only attempt made by secured party to notify debtor of time of private sale of repossessed collateral was by letter addressed to debtor and mailed by certified mail and that letter was returned to sender marked unclaimed and stamped "Postage Due 9 Cents, " there was no duty of debtor to show that the debtor did not willfully refuse the letter because postage was inadequate, and debtor did not receive notification required under these provisions. Edmondson v. Air Serv. Co., 123 Ga. App. 263, 180 S.E.2d 589 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice of time not specified.</b> - Notice only of intention to sell without any notification of time is not in compliance with Uniform Commercial Code as it precludes purchaser or owner from exercising right of redemption and therefore prevents the recovery of the deficiency. Motor Contract Co. v. Sawyer, 123 Ga. App. 207, 180 S.E.2d 282 (1971) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Former provisions did not demand that notice specify exactly when the sales would occur. It was sufficient for the creditor to notify debtor that the sales would occur only after certain dates, and so notice requirement was satisfied. Cessna Fin. Corp. v. Wall, 876 F. Supp. 273 (M.D. Ga. 1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice to debtor merely that creditor intends to pursue deficiency claim.</b> - In suit based on defaults in payment of two notes, while defendant was notified by certified mail that in event of sale plaintiff would pursue deficiency claim, this notice did not advise defendant of any contemplated sale, either public or private, thus creditor failed to comply with the former provisions, as notice is a condition precedent to recovery of any deficiency. GEMC Fed. Credit Union v. Shoemake, 151 Ga. App. 705, 261 S.E.2d 443 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice to secured party holding interest senior to that of selling secured party.</b> - Secured party who holds interest senior to one held by secured party selling property at public sale and who meets other requirements of Uniform Commercial Code must be sent notification of sale, and failure to do so gave rise to cause of action under former subsection (1). Bank of Camilla v. Stephens, 234 Ga. 293, 216 S.E.2d 71 (1975) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure to notify debtor.</b> - In action for conversion of mortgaged property, instruction that secured party had no right to sell property if no notice was given was erroneous, as the U.C.C. does not prohibit sale without notice, but rather provides that a debtor is entitled to recover any loss caused by such a sale, that is, a loss caused by a sale at a less than adequate price, and is also protected from any action by secured party to recover any deficiency between sale price and balance owing. Trust Co. v. Kite, 164 Ga. App. 119, 294 S.E.2d 606 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where bank failed to provide notice of sale to debtor hardware store, bank was precluded from obtaining deficiency against the store. First Nat'l Bank v. Rivercliff Hdwe., Inc., 161 Ga. App. 259, 287 S.E.2d 701 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A creditor who fails to comply with the provisions of the UCC as to repossessed collateral is met with two results for noncompliance: (1) It will be presumed that the value of the repossessed collateral equals the amount of the debt, and (2) even if the secured party overcomes such presumption, any recovery is subject to an offset of damages proved by the debtor resulting from the violation. Barney v. Morris, 168 Ga. App. 426, 309 S.E.2d 420 (1983); Emmons v. Burkett, 179 Ga. App. 838, 348 S.E.2d 323 (1986), rev'd on other grounds, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Creditor's failure to give notice in accordance with former subsection (3) did not as a matter of law preclude the creditor's<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>right of recovery. Emmons v. Burkett, 179 Ga. App. 838, 348 S.E.2d 323 (1986), rev'd on other grounds, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The Farmers Home Administration's failure to give notice of the sale of debtors' collateral, in violation of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>former subsection (3), barred the administration from recovering any deficiency against the debtors based upon their second security deed. United States ex rel. Farmers Home Admin. v. Kennedy, 806 F.2d 1014 (11th Cir. 1986). But see Emmons v. Burkett, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Misstatement of balance due.</b> - Debtor did not receive reasonable notification of the sale of repossessed property where the notice of sale understated the balance due at the time of the notice, thereby preventing the debtor from taking steps to protect its interest. Cessna Fin. Corp. v. Design Eng'g &amp; Constr. Int'l, Inc., 176 Ga. App. 206, 335 S.E.2d 625 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Endorser entitled to notice.</b> - An endorser's obligation under a promissory note, including the potential liability of any deficiency, makes obvious the endorser's interest in a fair and optimal disposition of repossessed collateral, and renders the purpose of requiring notice to the actual debtor equally applicable to the endorser. Davis v. Adel Banking Co., 175 Ga. App. 828, 334 S.E.2d 874 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Accommodation endorsers were entitled to notice of sale</b> of promissory note maker's collateral, even if the maker had waived own rights to notice. United States ex rel. Farmers Home Admin. v. Kennedy, 785 F.2d 1553 (11th Cir. 1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former subsection (3) held inapplicable.</b> - In a suit against the defendant as endorser of a note brought by a bank after it had exercised its power of sale on the residence of the insurer of the note, former subsection (3), relating to reasonable notification of sale, was inapplicable under the facts of the case. Breitzman v. Heritage Bank, 180 Ga. App. 171, 348 S.E.2d 713 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bank's compliance with O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 10-1-36 notice requirements.</b> Evidence of a bank's compliance with the notice requirements of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-36 was a sufficient showing of the bank's compliance with the cumulative and additional "reasonable notification" provision of former subsection (3). Calcote v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 179 Ga. App. 132, 345 S.E.2d 616 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Two attempts to deliver certified mail to the buyer's correct address met the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-36. Hill v. Federal Employees Credit Union, 193 Ga. App. 44, 386 S.E.2d 874 (1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice to guarantor not required.</b> - Nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code required that notice under former subsection (3) be given to guarantor. Brinson v. Commercial Bank, 138 Ga. App. 177, 225 S.E.2d 701 (1976), overruled on other grounds, Barbree v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A guarantor is not entitled to notice under the former provisions of this section. McNulty v. Codd, 157 Ga. App. 8, 276 S.E.2d 73 (1981), overruled on other grounds, Barbree v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982); First Nat'l Bank v. Rivercliff Hdwe., Inc., 161 Ga. App. 259, 287 S.E.2d 701 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A guarantor is not a "debtor" and therefore, not required under the Uniform Commercial Code to be notified by secured party of impending sale. Vickers v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 158 Ga. App. 434, 280 S.E.2d 842 (1981) (but see Reeves v. Habersham Bank, 254 Ga. 615, 331 S.E.2d 589 (1985), holding that a guarantor is a debtor within the meaning of former subsection (3)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dealer grantor of manufacturer financing.</b> - One who is a seller of chattel paper, whether or not that person is the owner of the underlying collateral, with full recourse against him in the event of a deficiency is a debtor entitled to notice of the post-default proceedings disposing of the collateral. Barbree v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Seller of farm equipment who had assigned retail installment contracts</b> was a "debtor" entitled to notice of sale under former subsection (3). Barbree v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 250 Ga. 409, 297 S.E.2d 465 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claiming loss of profits due to failure to give notice.</b> - In an action by a debtor for damages caused by repossession of collateral after an alleged breach of an agreement between the debtor and the secured party, where the debtor is in default the debtor cannot allege that the failure of the secured party to give notice as to the retention and sale of collateral caused the debtor to be damaged by loss of profits. Such violations only raise the presumption that the value of the collateral equals the amount due on the debt. Barney v. Morris, 168 Ga. App. 426, 309 S.E.2d 420 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice not required for transfer pursuant to standing full recourse assignment agreement.</b> - The last sentence in former subsection (5) made clear that a reassignment of collateral by a secured party pursuant to a standing full recourse assignment agreement was not a "sale or disposition of the collateral" that would activate the notice provisions of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>former subsection (3). Turner v. Trust Co. Bank, 210 Ga. App. 535, 436 S.E.2d 577 (1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice requirement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>may not be waived or varied. See</b> GEMC Fed. Credit Union v. Shoemake, 151 Ga. App. 705, 261 S.E.2d 443 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guaranty subject to waiver of notice of sale.</b> - Where the note hypothecating the property empowered the note's holder to "sell, assign, and deliver the whole or any part of the collateral at public or private sale, without demand, advertisement or notice of the time or place of sale or of any adjournment thereof, which are expressly waived," and the guaranty signed by defendant made itself subject to all terms and conditions in the notes evidencing the obligations which it guaranteed, defendant waived notice of the sale. United States v. Jones, 707 F.2d 1334 (11th Cir. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Showing required by debtor.</b> - Where debtor moves for summary judgment in deficiency proceeding where propriety of notice is in issue, debtor must show that debtor has not renounced or modified<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>right to notification of sale under these provisions. GEMC Fed. Credit Union v. Shoemake, 151 Ga. App. 705, 261 S.E.2d 443 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Receipt of notice admitted by failure to respond to requests for admissions.</b> - In a finance corporation's suit to recover a deficiency balance on an installment sales contract for a log loader, the trial court properly granted the corporation summary judgment upon concluding that no genuine issues of material fact existed based on the defending trucking company and the company's president failing to answer the requests for admissions that were served simultaneously with the complaint. By failing to respond and never challenging the trial court's denial of the motion to withdraw the admissions filed by the trucking company and the company's president, the following allegations were deemed admitted: that true and correct copies of the relevant documents, including the demand for payment were received; that the president executed the installment sales contract and the guaranty; that the president failed to make payments thereunder; that the principal balance due under the contract and guaranty was $34,442.44 as of a certain date; and that the money was owed to the finance corporation.

By failing to respond and never challenging the trial court's denial of the motion to withdraw the admissions filed by the trucking company and the company's president, the following allegations were deemed admitted: that true and correct copies of the relevant documents, including the demand for payment were received; that the president executed the installment sales contract and the guaranty; that the president failed to make payments thereunder; that the principal balance due under the contract and guaranty was $34,442.44 as of a certain date; and that the money was owed to the finance corporation.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In the light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions under former Article 9 are included in the annotations for this Code section. For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of collateral is permissive remedy.</b> - In stating that creditor may propose to keep goods in satisfaction of debt so long as the creditor gives required notice and no one objects, the former provisions merely set forth a permissive, not a mandatory, remedy. McCullough v. Mobiland, Inc., 139 Ga. App. 260, 228 S.E.2d 146 (1976); Ricker v. First Fed., 215 Ga. App. 793, 452 S.E.2d 583 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of former paragraph (1).</b> - Former paragraph (1) applied only where there is a security interest in consumer goods. Marshall v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 152 Ga. App. 121, 262 S.E.2d 448 (1979), rev'd on other grounds, 245 Ga. 745, 267 S.E.2d 225 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice requirement of former paragraph (2).</b> - The written notice required by former paragraph (2) must clearly state the creditor's proposal to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the debt and must notify the debtor that the debtor has 21 days in which to raise an objection to such a proposal. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The purpose of requiring written notice of a creditor's proposal to retain collateral in lieu of the debt and of prohibiting waiver of such notice before default is to provide the debtor with options for reducing loss when collateral has a value greater than the debt via redemption pursuant to former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-506 or liquidation in a commercially reasonable manner as required by former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-504. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though a debtor gave possession of a note and security deed and executed a transfer and assignment of the instruments to the creditor as collateral for a loan, the instruments never vested in the creditor and the transaction was not the creation or transfer of an interest in real estate under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-104(h); thus, where the creditor did not comply with the notice requirement of former paragraph (2), the debtor was entitled to recover either damages for conversion of the collateral after default or damages prescribed by former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-507. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of collateral.</b> - Allowing a debtor to reject a secured creditor's proposal to retain collateral in lieu of debt (after default) not only protects the debtor's right to mitigate loss, it protects the creditor from claims of the debtor that the creditor should have disposed of the collateral. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election barring deficiency claim.</b> - Creditor's written notice of repossession, of intent not to sell at a commercially reasonable sale, and of intent to keep the property for creditor's own use came within the ambit of former paragraph (2) and constituted an election barring the creditor's deficiency claim. Oraka v. Jaraysi, 226 Ga. App. 310, 486 S.E.2d 69 (1997) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of collateral after default does not preclude suit for money judgment.</b> McCullough v. Mobiland, Inc., 139 Ga. App. 260, 228 S.E.2d 146 (1976); Ricker v. First Fed., 215 Ga. App. 793, 452 S.E.2d 583 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rejection in writing by debtor.</b> - A debtor's defensive pleadings alleging that the creditor's petition failed to state a claim, the enumeration of various defenses to repossession, and a denial of all averments in the petition except jurisdiction, did not meet the requirement of this former section for a written objection to the creditor's notice of intention to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation. Edward McGill, Inc. v. Wise, 181 Ga. App. 486, 352 S.E.2d 809 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defaulting debtor cannot claim loss of profits due to failure to give notice.</b> - In an action by a debtor for damages caused by repossession of collateral after an alleged breach of an agreement between the debtor and the secured party, where the debtor is in default the debtor cannot allege that the failure of the secured party to give notice as to the retention and sale of collateral caused the debtor to be damaged by loss of profits. Such violations only raise the presumption that the value of the collateral equals the amount due on the debt. Barney v. Morris, 168 Ga. App. 426, 309 S.E.2d 420 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of creditor with respect to seized collateral.</b> - Once a creditor has possession of the collateral, the creditor must act in a commercially reasonable manner and is liable for any damage sustained by the debtor as a result of breach of that duty. Thus, personalty seized by the creditor must be applied toward liquidation of the debt, and the debtor is entitled to any damage sustained as a result of any failure by the creditor to act in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to the seized personalty. Ricker v. First Fed., 215 Ga. App. 793, 452 S.E.2d 583 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question remained whether secured creditor acted in manner amounting to retention of collateral</b> in satisfaction of the contract, such action constituting a rescission of the contract, there being evidence that the creditor offered to surrender the collateral to the debtor upon payment of the indebtedness, continually maintained that the transaction was valid, and otherwise acted in a manner consistent with the contract. ITT Terryphone Corp. v. Modems Plus, Inc., 171 Ga. App. 710, 320 S.E.2d 784 (1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exercise of rights under O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-9-620 as affecting successor liability doctrine.</b> - Corporate debtor that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy was not liable to an LLC for unpaid rent that was owed by a lock and key company, even though the same individual owned both companies and the debtor had accepted collateral the lock and key company owned in full satisfaction of debt the company owed. The debtor's decision to accept collateral the lock and key company owned in full satisfaction of the company's debt was permitted under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-620 and was not a fraudulent attempt to avoid liabilities the lock and key company owed, the debtor was not a "mere continuation" of the lock and key company, and a contrary conclusion would have elevated form over substance and abridged the equitable principles that were codified in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-3.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of former paragraph (1).</b> - Former paragraph (1) of this section applied only where there is a security interest in consumer goods. Marshall v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 152 Ga. App. 121, 262 S.E.2d 448 (1979), rev'd on other grounds, 245 Ga. 745, 267 S.E.2d 225 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice requirement of former paragraph (2).</b> - The written notice required by former paragraph (2) must clearly state the creditor's proposal to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the debt and must notify the debtor that the debtor has 21 days in which to raise an objection to such a proposal. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The purpose of requiring written notice of a creditor's proposal to retain collateral in lieu of the debt and of prohibiting waiver of such notice before default is to provide the debtor with options for reducing the debtor's loss when collateral has a value greater than the debt via redemption pursuant to former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-506 or liquidation in a commercially reasonable manner as required by former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-504. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though a debtor gave possession of a note and security deed and executed a transfer and assignment of the instruments to the creditor as collateral for a loan, the instruments never vested in the creditor and the transaction was not the creation or transfer of an interest in real estate under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-104(h); thus, where the creditor did not comply with the notice requirement of former paragraph (2), the debtor was entitled to recover either damages for conversion of the collateral after default or damages prescribed by former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-507. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of collateral.</b> - Allowing a debtor to reject a secured creditor's proposal to retain collateral in lieu of debt (after default) not only protects the debtor's right to mitigate loss, it protects the creditor from claims of the debtor that the creditor should have disposed of the collateral. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, 216 Ga. App. 878, 456 S.E.2d 237 (1995) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election barring deficiency claim.</b> - Creditor's written notice of repossession, of intent not to sell at a commercially reasonable sale, and of intent to keep the property for creditor's own use came within the ambit of former paragraph (2) and constituted an election barring the creditor's deficiency claim. Oraka v. Jaraysi, 226 Ga. App. 310, 486 S.E.2d 69 (1997) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of collateral after default does not preclude suit for money judgment.</b> McCullough v. Mobiland, Inc., 139 Ga. App. 260, 228 S.E.2d 146 (1976); Ricker v. First Fed., 215 Ga. App. 793, 452 S.E.2d 583 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rejection in writing by debtor.</b> - A debtor's defensive pleadings alleging that the creditor's petition failed to state a claim, the enumeration of various defenses to repossession, and a denial of all averments in the petition except jurisdiction, did not meet the requirement of these provisions for a written objection to the creditor's notice of intention to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation. Edward McGill, Inc. v. Wise, 181 Ga. App. 486, 352 S.E.2d 809 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defaulting debtor cannot claim loss of profits due to failure to give notice.</b> - In an action by a debtor for damages caused by repossession of collateral after an alleged breach of an agreement between the debtor and the secured party, where the debtor is in default the debtor cannot allege that the failure of the secured party to give notice as to the retention and sale of collateral caused the debtor to be damaged by loss of profits. Such violations only raise the presumption that the value of the collateral equals the amount due on the debt. Barney v. Morris, 168 Ga. App. 426, 309 S.E.2d 420 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of creditor with respect to seized collateral.</b> - Once a creditor has possession of the collateral, the creditor must act in a commercially reasonable manner and is liable for any damage sustained by the debtor as a result of breach of that duty. Thus, personalty seized by the creditor must be applied toward liquidation of the debt, and the debtor is entitled to any damage sustained as a result of any failure by the creditor to act in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to the seized personalty. Ricker v. First Fed., 215 Ga. App. 793, 452 S.E.2d 583 (1994) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question remained whether secured creditor acted in manner amounting to retention of collateral</b> in satisfaction of the contract, such action constituting a rescission of the contract, there being evidence that the creditor offered to surrender the collateral to the debtor upon payment of the indebtedness, continually maintained that the transaction was valid, and otherwise acted in a manner consistent with the contract. ITT Terryphone Corp. v. Modems Plus, Inc., 171 Ga. App. 710, 320 S.E.2d 784 (1984) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Willis v. Healthdyne, Inc., 191 Ga. App. 671, 382 S.E.2d 651 (1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-507).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disposition approved in judicial proceeding.</b> - A judicial order which merely authorized plaintiff to conduct a commercially reasonable sale but did not declare the manner in which plaintiff ultimately conducted the sale to be commercially reasonable did not constitute judicial approval of the sale which would conclusively deem the sale to be commercially reasonable. Carlton Mfg., Inc. v. Bauer, 207 Ga. App. 850, 429 S.E.2d 329 (1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-507).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creditor's failure to notify of dispository intent immaterial.</b> - Where collateral securing debt was never repossessed by subsequent creditor but was instead sold at auction by guarantor's bankruptcy trustee and the proceeds thereof were retained by the trustee as an asset of the bankruptcy estate and not distributed to creditor, pursuant to former paragraph (2), this disposition by creditor's representative was conclusively deemed to be commercially reasonable, rendering immaterial creditor's failure to notify guarantor of its intent not to repossess and dispose of that collateral. Davis v. Concord Com. Corp., 209 Ga. App. 595, 434 S.E.2d 571 (1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-507).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Reasonable terms of sale.</b> - For secured party to meet burden of proving every aspect of sale to be commercially reasonable, it must establish affirmatively that the "terms" of sale were commercially reasonable; this includes burden to show that resale price was fair and reasonable value of collateral. Granite Equip. Leasing Corp. v. Marine Dev. Corp., 139 Ga. App. 778, 230 S.E.2d 43 (1976) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-507). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Overcoming presumption that value of collateral equals debt.</b> - Presumption that value of collateral equals debt on it is overcome by proving fair and reasonable value of collateral, whereupon creditor is entitled to deficiency judgment in amount of debt (plus or minus any payments or charges properly applicable to disposition) less fair and reasonable value of collateral proved by creditor (if resale price is less than fair and reasonable value proved).

<p class="p4">Sale of repossessed collateral is not commercially reasonable when there is wide discrepancy between sale price and value of such collateral (presumed to equal amount of debt in absence of proof otherwise) coupled with secured party's failure to prove value at time of repossession, and that such value does not equal debt. Granite Equip. Leasing Corp. v. Marine Dev. Corp., 139 Ga. App. 778, 230 S.E.2d 43 (1976) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-507).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Notice to secured party holding interest senior to that of selling secured party.</b> - Secured party who holds interest senior to one held by secured party selling property at public sale and who meets other requirements of Code, must be sent notification of sale, and failure to do so gives rise to cause of action under the former provisions of this section.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of property by secured party without notice.</b> - In action for conversion of mortgaged property, instruction that secured party had no right to sell property if no notice was given was erroneous, as the U.C.C. does not prohibit sale without notice, but rather provides that a debtor is entitled to recover any loss caused by such a sale, that is, a loss caused by a sale at a less than adequate price, and is also protected from any action by secured party to recover any deficiency between sale price and balance owing. Trust Co. v. Kite, 164 Ga. App. 119, 294 S.E.2d 606 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-507). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Repossessed collateral need not be disposed of where only fraction of value recoverable.</b> - A secured creditor did not act in a commercially unreasonable manner when it repossessed the collateral and, without ever disposing of it, filed suit against the debtor, there being evidence that the collateral was the type of equipment which in the past the creditor had been able to dispose of at only a fraction of its original sale value. However, if it was later established that the creditor did not act in a commercially reasonable manner, the balance of the indebtedness owed on the contracts would be reduced by the value of the equipment at the time it was repossessed, plus the amount of any damage sustained as a result of the creditor's inaction in returning or disposing of the goods.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to prove fair and reasonable value of minibuses.</b> - Secured creditor failed to prove the fair and reasonable value of minibuses at the time of sale, where the only evidence of value of the vehicles was the offers received after the default by the creditor's corporate president, upon the solicitation of some 15 individuals nationwide, and the actual price paid at the sale of the vehicles.

<p class="p4"><b>State remedy precludes federal due process claim.</b> - Because Georgia provided a remedy for improper repossession pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-625, a former arrestee, who claimed that police officers interfered with the arrestee's possessory interests in a vehicle at the time of the arrest, had no federal due process claim with respect to the repossession of the vehicle.

<p class="p11">(5) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under subsection (f) of Code Section 11-9-615, the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Fact that every aspect of foreclosure sale (method, manner, time, place and terms) must be commercially reasonable is a condition precedent to recovery of any deficiency between sale price and balance remaining due on contract price, and if sale is not commercially reasonable plaintiff can recover nothing, because it is then presumed that price on foreclosure sale in fact does represent full value of article at time of repossession.

<p class="p4"><b>Absolute bar rule.</b> - These code provisions do not require the imposition of an absolute-bar rule and the absolute-bar rule is contrary to the intent of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-1-106 which expressly prohibits penal damages. Emmons v. Burkett, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption that value of collateral equals debt.</b> - Failure on part of secured party to establish that fair and reasonable value of collateral does not equal debt results in presumption that value of collateral disposed of is at least equal to debt, from which it follows that no deficiency judgment can be obtained. Hubbard v. Farmers Bank, 155 Ga. App. 720, 272 S.E.2d 510 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Secured party must prove value of collateral at time of repossession and that value of goods does not equal value of debt. Richard v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 158 Ga. App. 595, 281 S.E.2d 338 (1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Failure to introduce any evidence of the fair and reasonable value of the collateral, in order to overcome the presumption that the value of the collateral equaled the amount of the debt, will operate as a failure to establish that the disposition of the collateral was commercially reasonable; and therefore no deficiency judgment can be obtained. Giddens v. Bo Lovein Ford, Inc., 167 Ga. App. 699, 307 S.E.2d 271 (1983) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Overcoming presumption concerning collateral.</b> - The presumption that the value of collateral equals the debt on it is overcome by proving the fair and reasonable value of the collateral. First Nat'l Bank v. Rivercliff Hdwe., Inc., 161 Ga. App. 259, 287 S.E.2d 701 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Value presumed equal to debt owed.</b> - Absent evidence of the value of collateral at the time of repossession, the value of the goods is presumed to be equal to the debt owed. Borden v. Pope Jeep-Eagle, Inc., 200 Ga. App. 176, 407 S.E.2d 128 (1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sole defect in sale was adequacy of price.</b> - Creditor who fails to prove that notice of sale was given debtor (where required) or fails to prove that disposition, including its method, manner, time, place and terms, was commercially reasonable, is barred from obtaining a deficiency judgment, except where sole defect is adequacy of sale price, in which event creditor is not barred from recovery but must overcome presumption that value of collateral equals debt. Richard v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 158 Ga. App. 595, 281 S.E.2d 338 (1981); First Nat'l Bank v. Rivercliff Hdwe., Inc., 161 Ga. App. 259, 287 S.E.2d 701 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where sole defect in sale of collateral is adequacy of sale price, creditor is not barred from obtaining deficiency judgment; however, creditor must overcome presumption that value of collateral equals debt on it, proving its fair and reasonable value. Zohbe v. First Nat'l Bank, 162 Ga. App. 604, 292 S.E.2d 444 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Collection of deficiency balance dependent on reasonable notice.</b> - Former section permitted secured creditor to dispose of collateral if debtor defaults, but before creditor can pursue deficiency balance it must reasonably notify debtor of time and place of any public sale or of time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made. Lacy v. General Fin. Corp., 651 F.2d 1026 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proceeding against real property prevented.</b> - Where a sale of collateral occurs without notice, in violation of former subsection (3), the bar against collection of a deficiency prevents a creditor holding a claim against a guarantor secured by real property from proceeding against the real estate to collect the balance remaining after a commercially unreasonable sale of the personalty. United States ex rel. FHA v. Kennedy, 256 Ga. 345, 348 S.E.2d 636 (1986) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Satisfaction sought through personal judgment, out of collateral or pursuant to guaranty.</b> - The rule precluding recovery of a deficiency where the secured party has failed to dispose of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner or provide the debtor with reasonable notification of the disposition is applicable where a secured creditor seeks to satisfy the deficiency either through a personal judgment or out of collateral or pursuant to a guaranty. Reeves v. Habersham Bank, 254 Ga. 615, 331 S.E.2d 589 (1985) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rebuttable presumption rule.</b> - The rebuttable presumption rule, by placing the burden on the creditor to show the propriety of the sale and making the creditor liable for any injury to the debtor, provides an adequate deterrent to an improper sale on the part of a creditor and adequately protects the debtor's interest, without arbitrarily penalizing the creditor. Emmons v. Burkett, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under the rebuttable presumption rule, if a creditor fails to give notice or conducts an unreasonable sale, the presumption is raised that the value of the collateral is equal to the indebtedness. To overcome this presumption, the creditor must present evidence of the fair and reasonable value of the collateral, and the evidence must show that such value was less than the debt. If the creditor rebuts the presumption, the creditor may maintain an action against the debtor or guarantor for any deficiency. Any loss suffered by the debtor as a consequence of the failure to give notice or to conduct a commercially reasonable sale is recoverable and may be set off against the deficiency. Emmons v. Burkett, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A more complete statement of the rule set forth in Emmons v. Burkette, 256 Ga. 855, 353 S.E.2d 908 (1987), is: If the creditor conducts a commercially unreasonable sale and does not rebut the presumption that the value of the collateral is equal to the indebtedness, the creditor loses the right to recover the deficiency against the debtor and the guarantor. If the presumption is rebutted, the first to recover the deficiency remains as held in Emmons. Business Dev. Corp. v. Contestabile, 261 Ga. 886, 413 S.E.2d 447 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creditor showing of reasonableness as prerequisite to deficiency judgment.</b> - If condition precedent of commercial reasonableness is not met in foreclosure sale, no recovery is possible, and burden is on creditor to prove such. Brown v. C.I.T. Corp., 150 Ga. App. 361, 258 S.E.2d 44 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Showing required to recover deficiency.</b> - Burden is on secured party to prove value of collateral at time of repossession and that such value does not equal debt; failure to do so results in presumption that value was at least amount of debt. BVA Credit Corp. v. May, 152 Ga. App. 733, 264 S.E.2d 32 (1979); Comfort Trane Air Conditioning Co. v. Trane Co., 592 F.2d 1373 (5th Cir. 1979); Georgia Cent. Credit Union v. Coleman, 155 Ga. App. 547, 271 S.E.2d 681 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellee secured creditor had burden of overcoming presumption that value of trucks equaled the debts on them by evidence of their fair and reasonable values, and evidence of resale prices was not sufficient to do this, nor were appellee's affiant's conclusory statements that they were sold in a commercially reasonable manner, thus, grant of summary judgment for appellee on claim for deficiency was error. Davis v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 164 Ga. App. 137, 296 S.E.2d 431 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debtor's burden after creditor proves commercial reasonableness.</b> - Where creditor shows prima facie that sale of collateral was reasonable, to prevent summary judgment for deficiency, debtor must support debtor's challenge to the sale by asserting specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Slaughter v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 164 Ga. App. 428, 296 S.E.2d 428 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debtor's burden after creditor files a deficiency claim.</b> - A proof of claim constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim, shifting the burden of proof to the debtor to show that the deficiency claim should not be allowed; the mere recitation of National Automobile Dealers Association mobile home values is insufficient for this purpose without some evidentiary connection to the actual home at issue.

For a table of comparable provisions, see the table at the beginning of the Article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commercially reasonable disposition as prerequisite for deficiency judgment.</b> - If the secured party does not dispose of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner, there can be no recovery of any deficiency between the sale price and the unpaid balance. Granite Equip. Leasing Corp. v. Marine Dev. Corp., 139 Ga. App. 778, 230 S.E.2d 43 (1976) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fact that every aspect of foreclosure sale (method, manner, time, place and terms) must be commercially reasonable is a condition precedent to recovery of any deficiency between sale price and balance remaining due on contract price, and if sale is not commercially reasonable plaintiff can recover nothing, because it is then presumed that price on foreclosure sale in fact does represent full value of article at time of repossession. Brown v. C.I.T. Corp., 150 Ga. App. 361, 258 S.E.2d 44 (1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In Georgia, a secured party is absolutely prohibited from recovering deficiency judgment where notice is not given or sale is commercially unreasonable. Comfort Trane Air Conditioning Co. v. Trane Co., 592 F.2d 1373 (5th Cir. 1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though defendant debtor failed to introduce any testimony while denying claim in its entirety, burden of proof was upon secured party to prove sale was done in a commercially reasonable manner in order to recover on deficiency. Georgia Cent. Credit Union v. Coleman, 155 Ga. App. 547, 271 S.E.2d 681 (1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the case of a loan secured by both real and personal property, the provision for liquidation of the guarantor's personal property "in a commercially reasonable manner" did not apply where the lender chose to exercise its "rights and remedies in respect of the real property" as permitted under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-501(4).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale must allow debtor to exercise redemption right.</b> - Act of secured party, in selling collateral without strict compliance with notice of sale provisions precludes purchaser or owner from exercising right of redemption under former <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-506, and for that reason secured party cannot recover for deficiency owed by purchaser. Braswell v. American Nat'l Bank, 117 Ga. App. 699, 161 S.E.2d 420 (1968) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Cost alone</b> is never proof of market value. Zohbe v. First Nat'l Bank, 162 Ga. App. 604, 292 S.E.2d 444 (1982) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commercially reasonable disposition required.</b> - Although Uniform Commercial Code has no requirement that secured party sell collateral after repossession, secured party who does not elect to retain collateral in satisfaction of indebtedness must act in commercially reasonable manner in disposing of it, and disposition must be made in commercially reasonable time. Henderson Few &amp; Co. v. Rollins Communications, Inc., 148 Ga. App. 139, 250 S.E.2d 830 (1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Once creditor has possession the creditor must act in a commercially reasonable manner toward sale, lease, proposed retention where permissible, or other disposition. If such disposition is not feasible, the asset must be returned, still subject, of course, to creditor's security interest.
