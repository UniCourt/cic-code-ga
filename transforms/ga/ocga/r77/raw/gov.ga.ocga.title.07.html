<p class="p4"><b>Corporation did not meet definition of person.</b> - Corporation was not an eligible "payable on death" (POD) beneficiary on certificates of deposit or a trust account because under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-810(11), a POD payee on a death account had to have been a person, and under <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-810(2), a beneficiary on a trust account had to have been a person; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-4(26), a "person" was defined as an individual, trust, general or limited partnership, unincorporated association (except a joint-stock association), or any other form of unincorporated enterprise. Thus, the corporation did not meet the statutory definition of person. Tuvim v. United Jewish Cmtys., Inc., 285 Ga. 632, 680 S.E.2d 827 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Issuance of passbook.</b> - Deposit is or is not, according to agreement, subject to check on bank with which the deposit was actually placed, and may or may not bear interest, and may be or may not be payable on demand. Issuance of a passbook is not conclusive evidence, but is material on the question whether the transaction is simply that of a borrower and lender in the ordinary sense or that of a deposit. Citizens Bank v. Mobley, 166 Ga. 543, 144 S.E. 119 (1928), (decided under former GA. L. 1919, p. 135).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

For the purposes of this subsection, a financial institution shall not be considered regulated solely because it is required to file an exemption from licensing under Code Section 7-1-1001 or solely because it is owned or controlled by another bank or corporation which is or may be examined or regulated by the department. All extensions of credit, including but not limited to such permitted loans, which obligate the commissioner or any deputy commissioner to such a financial institution or subsidiary, directly or contingently by way of guaranty, endorsement, or otherwise, or which renew or modify existing obligations shall be reported by the individual concerned to the Attorney General in writing, within ten days after the execution thereof, showing the nature of the undertaking and the amount and terms of the loan or other transaction.

<p class="p13">(2) The effect of the proposed acquisition of control in any section of this state may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly or the proposed acquisition of control would in any other manner be in restraint of trade and the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition of control are not clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(3) The financial condition of any acquiring person is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the bank or prejudice the interests of the depositors of the bank; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(4) The competence, experience, or integrity of any acquiring person or of any of the proposed management personnel indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors of the bank or in the interest of the public to permit such person to control the bank; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p13">(6) In the case of trust companies, any acquiring person or an individual that is a director or officer of such person has unsatisfactory results from a fingerprint record check report conducted by the Georgia Crime Information Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The department shall be authorized to obtain conviction data with respect to any acquiring person or an individual that is a director or officer of such person, and such acquiring person or an individual that is a director or officer of such person shall provide express written consent to the department to conduct a criminal background check and to use all information necessary to run such check, including, but not limited to, a classifiable set of fingerprints.

Such notice shall include the specific federal authorization of the activity to be utilized, the proposed action to be undertaken by the bank, documentation indicating that the bank satisfies the prescribed federal standards, if any, to engage in the activity, and such other information as may be required by the department. Upon receipt of such notice, the commissioner shall determine whether the exercise of any federal power or the availing of any federal preclusion or preemption, or any part thereof, by the bank is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or presents undue risk to the safety and soundness of the banking system. In making such a determination, the commissioner shall consider the financial condition of the bank, the regulatory safety and soundness ratings of the bank, the ability of bank management to administer and supervise the activity, and the overall impact on the safety and soundness to all other state chartered banks. Based on such a determination, the commissioner may object to the exercise of the federal power, in whole or in part, or to the federal preclusion or preemption of the law, rule, or regulation of this state, in whole or in part, including objecting to a level or quantity above which a bank may be seeking to exercise a federal power or availing itself of any federal preclusion or preemption of law, rule, or regulation of this state.

<p class="p4">Purpose of O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-352 is to protect a bank from liability in the event that an agent or fiduciary misappropriates funds of an owner in breach of the agency or trust without the bank's knowledge, and the statute protects a bank from liability for embezzlement by a signatory on a corporate bank account if the person setting up the account had the authority to do so and if the bank was without knowledge of the embezzlement.

<p class="p4"><b>Banks not required to scrutinize every check written by a fiduciary or agent.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 13-2042 is designed to protect the bank from liability when the agent or fiduciary misappropriates funds of the owner in breach of agency or trust without bank's knowledge.

<p class="p4"><b>Corporate resolution is not exclusive method for conferring authority.</b> - While a bank could easily protect the bank's interests by requiring a proper corporate resolution showing an agent's authority to act for the corporation, that method is not the exclusive one for establishing the existence either of authority or of inherent agency power to open a bank account for the corporation.

The language of former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 41A-1701 was broad enough to cover a savings and loan account as a deposit, therefore, former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 41A-1309 was inapplicable to deposits in mutual savings and loan associations and former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 41A-1701 permitted banks to deposit the bank's funds in these associations. Since the Georgia Supreme Court has not ruled on the question of whether such a deposit was equivalent to the purchase of shares in a corporation, federal law will not permit a state bank member of the federal reserve to make deposits in a Georgia building and loan association; however, there was no reason why a state bank which is not a member of the federal reserve cannot deposit the bank's funds in a state association. 1978 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial notice.</b> - After the FDIC brought claims against a bank's former directors and officers for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and gross negligence, a court declined to take judicial notice of facts in the FDIC's Officer of Inspector General's Audit Report of the Bank and its Congressional testimony that the defendants alleged rebutted allegations that the defendants were negligent or grossly negligent because at the motion to dismiss stage, it was not for the court to weigh those facts against allegations of the complaint and determine, as a matter of law, whether the defendants breached the standard of care required under Georgia law.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Business judgment rule applies.</b> - FDIC's claims against former officers and directors of a bank for ordinary negligence and breach of fiduciary duty were subject to the business judgment rule. The FDIC rebutted the business judgment presumption, and the FDIC's claims could go forward, as the allegations of the complaint, taken together, painted a picture of the officers and directors failing to implement any safeguards and ignoring the ones actually put in place so that they could pursue a rapid growth strategy and accumulate large profits in a short period of time.

Preferential terms, rates, and conditions shall be determined by comparison to those terms, rates, and conditions offered contemporaneously to other borrowers making substantially similar loan requests, having substantially similar credit histories, and offering substantially similar collateral. Such loans shall be made only after the application of prudent loan underwriting criteria normally applied to loan requests of a similar nature from applicants who are not directors and policy-making officers.

</p>
<p class="p13">(1) The board of directors shall adopt a resolution recommending such sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition, specifying, to the extent that the board sees fit, any or all of the terms and conditions thereof and the consideration to be received by the bank or trust company therefor and directing the submission thereof to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, which may be either an annual or a special meeting; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p13">(3) At such meeting the shareholders may authorize such sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition and may approve or fix, or may authorize the board of directors to fix, any or all of the terms and conditions thereof and the consideration to be received by the bank or trust company therefor. Such authorization shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the corporation entitled to vote thereon, unless any class of shares is entitled to vote thereon as a class, in which event such authorization shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of each class of shares entitled to vote thereon as a class and of the total shares entitled to vote thereon. Any class of shares shall be entitled to vote as a class if the resolution proposing the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition contains any provision which, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles, would entitle such class of shares to vote as a class; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(4) If the shareholders approve the proposed sale or other disposition, the bank or trust company shall make application to the department for approval thereof in such form as may be specified by the department.

<p class="p13">(5) After such authorization by a vote of shareholders and by the department, the board of directors, nevertheless, in its discretion, may abandon such sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of assets, subject to the rights of third parties under any contracts relating thereto, without further action or approval by shareholders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(6) In the case of a sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, the property and assets of a bank or trust company, a notice shall be published in each county in which the bank or trust company has an office engaged in the banking or trust business in the manner prescribed by subsection (c) of Code Section 7-1-552.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Such notice shall include the specific federal authorization of the activity to be utilized, the proposed action to be undertaken by the credit union, documentation indicating that the credit union satisfies the prescribed federal standards, if any, to engage in the activity, and such other information as may be required by the department. Upon receipt of such notice, the commissioner shall determine whether the exercise of any federal power or the availing of any federal preclusion or preemption, or any part thereof, by the credit union is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or presents undue risk to the safety and soundness of the banking system. In making such a determination, the commissioner shall consider the financial condition of the credit union, the regulatory safety and soundness ratings of the credit union, the ability of credit union management to administer and supervise the activity, and the overall impact on the safety and soundness to all other state chartered credit unions. Based on such a determination, the commissioner may object to the exercise of the federal power, in whole or in part, or to the federal preclusion or preemption of the law, rule, or regulation of this state, in whole or in part, including objecting to a level or quantity above which a credit union may be seeking to exercise a federal power or availing itself of any federal preclusion or preemption of law, rule, or regulation of this state. If the commissioner so objects, the commissioner shall deliver such objection in writing by certified or registered mail to the credit union within 45 days of receipt of the notice; provided, however, that the commissioner may extend such period of review for an additional 45 days by providing the credit union with written notice of such extension prior to the expiration of the initial notice period. If the commissioner sends such an objection, the federal power, preclusion, or preemption, or the part thereof, objected to by the commissioner shall not be exercised by the credit union pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this Code section. The objection by the commissioner of a credit union's intent to exercise a federal power or avail itself of any federal preclusion or preemption shall not preclude such credit union from providing notice to the department of its intent to exercise the same federal power or to avail itself of the same federal preclusion or preemption at a later date; provided, however, that the requirements of this subsection shall be applicable for any such additional notice. Further, in the event a credit union determines, after satisfying the notice provisions of this subsection, that it no longer wishes to exercise a federal power or avail itself of any federal preclusion or preemption, then such credit union shall provide written notice of such fact to the commissioner by certified or registered mail. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The only way an effective transfer or pledge may be accomplished so as to affect the rights of the association is by transfer on the books of the association in the case of transfer or written notice of a pledge entered on the books of the association and acknowledged in writing in the case of a pledge; and the association shall be protected in paying any part of a deposit to the holder thereof as shown on the books of the association unless it has received written notice of a pledge or transfer thereof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The presumption of joint ownership is a rebuttable one and when the joint account was created as a matter of convenience with no intention of conferring a beneficial interest upon the codepositor the presumption is rebutted.

<p class="p13">As used in this article, the term:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p13">(1) "Account" means a contract of deposit of funds between a depositor and a financial institution and includes a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit, share account, and other like arrangements. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(2) "Beneficiary" means a person named in a trust account as one for whom a party to the account is named as trustee. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(3) "Financial institution" means a savings and loan association as defined in paragraph (31) of Code Section 7-1-4 or any financial institution as defined in paragraph (21) of Code Section 7-1-4. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(4) "Joint account" means an account payable on request to one or more of two or more parties, whether or not mention is made of any right of survivorship. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(5) "Multiple-party account" means any of the following types of account: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(A) A joint account; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(B) A P.O.D. account; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(C) A trust account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p13">It does not include accounts established for deposit of funds of a partnership, joint venture, or other association for business purposes; accounts controlled by one or more persons as the duly authorized agent or trustee for a corporation, unincorporated association, or charitable or civic organization; or a regular fiduciary or trust account where the relationship is established other than by deposit agreement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(6) "Net contribution" of a party to a multiple-party account as of any given time means the sum of all deposits thereto made by or for him, less all withdrawals made by or for him which have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance. The term includes, in addition, any proceeds of deposit life insurance added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(7) "Party" means a person who, by the terms of the account, has a present right, subject to request, to payment from a multiple-party account. A P.O.D. payee or beneficiary of a trust account is a party only after the account becomes payable to him by reason of his surviving the original payee or trustee. Unless the context otherwise requires, it includes a guardian, conservator, personal representative, or assignee, including an attaching creditor, of a party. It also includes a person identified as a trustee of an account for another, whether or not a beneficiary is named; but it does not include any named beneficiary unless he has a present right of withdrawal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(8) "Payment" of sums on deposit includes withdrawal, payment on check or other directive of a party, and any pledge of sums on deposit by a party and any setoff or reduction or other disposition of all or part of an account pursuant to a pledge. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(9) "Proof of death" includes a death certificate or official record which is prima-facie proof of death. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(10) "P.O.D. account" means an account payable on request to one person during his or her lifetime or to an incorporated entity and on such person's death to one or more P.O.D. payees or to one or more persons during their lifetimes or to an incorporated entity and on the death of all of them or the dissolution of the incorporated entity to one or more P.O.D. payees. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(11) "P.O.D. payee" means a person or an incorporated entity designated on a P.O.D. account as one to whom the account is payable on request after the death of one or more persons. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(12) "Request" means a proper request for withdrawal or a check or order for payment which complies with all conditions of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the financial institution; but, if the financial institution conditions withdrawal or payment on advance notice, for purposes of this article the request for withdrawal or payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for withdrawal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(13) "Sums on deposit" means the balance payable on a multiple-party account, including interest, dividends, and, in addition, any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of a party. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(14) "Trust account" means an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries where the relationship is established by the form of the account and the deposit agreement with the financial institution and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account; it is not essential that payment to the beneficiary be mentioned in the deposit agreement. A trust account does not include a regular trust account under a testamentary trust or a trust agreement which has significance apart from the account or a fiduciary account arising from a fiduciary relation such as attorney-client. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(15) "Withdrawal" includes payment to a third person pursuant to check or other directive of a party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Party's net contribution included amounts deposited for party.</b> - In a dispute over a joint account created by a father, mother, and daughter, although only the father made contributions to the account, the daughter's contributions could include deposits made by the father for the daughter; because some evidence indicated an intent that the money would belong to the daughter, the trial court erred by concluding that all of the funds belonged to the mother after the father's death.

<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-812 created a presumption that a party funding a joint account did not intend to make a gift of the funds of the account during the funder's life, and that presumption was subject to rebuttal only by clear and convincing evidence of a contrary intent.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In order to constitute a "joint account"</b> for purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-813, an arrangement must constitute a contract of deposit of funds between a depositor and a financial institution; a municipal bond is not a contract of deposit, but an evidence of indebtness issued by a city or other corporate public body. Urban v. Lemley, 232 Ga. App. 259, 501 S.E.2d 529 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumptions.</b> - When savings certificates were issued jointly to a decedent and another party and since the certificates contain no language expressly creating a survivorship interest, one of two presumptions will be applied, depending on the date of issue of the certificates: (1) if the certificates were issued before the effective date of former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 41A-3804 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-813), July 1, 1976, the presumption is that there was no right of survivorship intended; or (2) if the certificates were issued after July 1, 1976, there is a presumption that a right of survivorship was intended unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Collins v. Collins, 176 Ga. App. 79, 335 S.E.2d 307 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There exists a presumption that a right of survivorship is intended by the issuance of joint certificates of deposit, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Wynn v. Wynn, 202 Ga. App. 679, 415 S.E.2d 287, cert. denied, 202 Ga. App. 907, 415 S.E.2d 287 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred to the extent the court applied the presumption in O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-813(a) to funds which the executors withdrew from the original joint accounts and placed in accounts solely in their name because to the extent they took funds in excess of their ownership from a joint account containing funds owned by two beneficiaries and placed those funds in an account in their name, they severed the joint account relationship and extinguished the presumption that the funds belonged to them. Shirley v. Sailors, 329 Ga. App. 850, 766 S.E.2d 201 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Survivorship presumption rebutted.</b> - Presumption of survivorship in O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-813 was effectively rebutted since there was testimony from a family member that around the time decedent opened a certificate account with the money from the decedent's sister's estate, the decedent gave assurances that the money was "taken care of" and would eventually reach those the money was intended to reach, as the plaintiff would "do the right thing with it". Hopkins v. Moore, 207 Ga. App. 383, 427 S.E.2d 853 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When as the decedent had done with other assets, a decedent designated the defendant as co-owner with the decedent of subordinated debentures with right of survivorship, evidence was sufficient to show that decedent intended that the defendant should receive the gifts which resulted from the defendant's transfer of their debentures and the sale of stock decedent owned individually. Stewart v. Stewart, 240 Ga. App. 573, 524 S.E.2d 267 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Denial of a sister's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict was affirmed as there was evidence supporting the imposition of a constructive trust after a mother's death on a bank account owned jointly with a right of survivorship by the mother and the sister since the sister acknowledged that the account was opened for the mother's convenience. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 281 Ga. App. 756, 637 S.E.2d 56 (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 87 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Survivorship presumption not rebutted.</b> - In an action by the executor of a joint tenant's estate against the executor of the surviving joint tenant's estate, evidence presented by the former was not sufficient to overcome the presumption that funds in joint bank accounts belong to the survivor's estate. Urban v. Lemley, 232 Ga. App. 259, 501 S.E.2d 529 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Denial of a sister's and an executrix's motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict were reversed as a constructive trust could not be imposed over the proceeds of a condemnation since: (1) a mother did not make any agreement with her children regarding the quitclaim deeds or the proceeds of the condemnation; (2) the documents signed by the siblings were unequivocal and unrestricted; (3) the mother did not make any promise with the intent not to carry it out; (4) there was nothing to indicate that when the mother obtained a certificate of deposit and opened a money market account in her and the executrix's and the sister's names as joint tenants with right of survivorship, she meant to do anything other than that; and (5) the siblings did not raise the issue of a constructive trust in the condemnation proceedings and were collaterally estopped from raising the issue in a later action. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 281 Ga. App. 756, 637 S.E.2d 56 (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 87 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient evidence to overcome presumption.</b> - In an action to recover property of an estate, when the administrator presented evidence that the decedent intended to divide the decedent's estate among the decedent's children equally and did not intend for the decedent's two youngest sons to have the funds in the joint accounts at the decedent's death, and also presented evidence of undue influence in the creation of the accounts, there was some evidence to overcome the presumption arising from O.C.G.A <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-813, and a directed verdict was inappropriate. Myers v. Myers, 195 Ga. App. 529, 394 S.E.2d 374 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lack of intention to make gift of funds.</b> - Trial judge's determination that the decedent's lack of intention to make a gift of the funds to the decedent's daughter was established by clear and convincing evidence; thus, applying either O.C.G.A <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-813(a) or pre-existing law, the trial judge was authorized to declare that the funds belonged to the estate. James v. Elder, 186 Ga. App. 810, 368 S.E.2d 570 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence showing that the decedent's daughter had suggested putting another name on the decedent's certificates of deposit "in case Mama got sick," provided clear and convincing support for the jury's determination that the decedent had added the daughter's name to the certificates for convenience rather than to effect a gift of the funds to the daughter. Turner v. Mikell, 195 Ga. App. 766, 395 S.E.2d 20 (1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since the decedent's expressed intent in establishing joint accounts was for the convenience of the decedent's niece in writing checks, paying bills and expenses, and handling the decedent's affairs during the decedent's illness, there was sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the niece, as surviving joint tenant, was entitled to the accounts. Williamson v. Echols, 205 Ga. App. 453, 422 S.E.2d 329 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intent held question for jury.</b> - After a decedent had given a power of attorney to the decedent's nephews, and created joint accounts with one of the nephews, while expressing a concern that someone have access to the decedent's money should the decedent become ill, but there was testimony that the decedent understood the effect of survivorship accounts, there existed a material issue regarding the decedents' intent, which created a jury question. Godwin v. Johnson, 197 Ga. App. 829, 399 S.E.2d 581 (1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action for conversion of an estate's assets relating to a joint account created under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-813 between the executrix and a half-sister, given that some evidence existed that the decedent's purpose in establishing a joint account between the executrix of the decedent's estate and the half-sister was for the decedent's convenience, and not to effect a gift, summary judgment was erroneously granted to the half-sister. Gray v. Benton, 280 Ga. App. 339, 634 S.E.2d 86 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a dispute over a joint account created by a father, mother, and daughter, although only the father made contributions to the account, the daughter's contributions could include deposits made by him for her; because some evidence indicated an intent that the money would belong to the daughter, the trial court erred by concluding that all of the funds belonged to the mother after the father's death. Howard v. Leonard, 330 Ga. App. 331, 765 S.E.2d 466 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Simultaneous death of husband and wife.</b> - When the husband and wife died simultaneously there is no evidence, either "clear and convincing" or otherwise, which would authorize a finding that the husband did not intend for the wife to have a right of survivorship as to the joint bank accounts. Trust Co. Bank v. Thornton, 204 Ga. App. 903, 420 S.E.2d 817 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equitable division of property titled in name of surviving wife.</b> - When the issue of the division of marital assets of a former husband and wife had not been resolved at the time of the husband's death, property acquired as a direct result of the labor and investments of the former husband during the course of the marriage was subject to equitable division in spite of the fact that it was titled in the former wife's name after the former husband's death as a matter of contract law. White v. White, 253 Ga. 267, 319 S.E.2d 447 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ex-spouse entitled to balance of funds jointly held.</b> - In a dispute between an estate administratrix and the decedent's ex-spouse, the trial court did not err by granting the ex-spouse summary judgment as to the accounts that were jointly held with the decedent because their divorce settlement agreement did not address such accounts and Georgia law entitled the ex-spouse to the balance remaining. Lowry v. Fenzel, 331 Ga. App. 603, 769 S.E.2d 522 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Joint tenancy not terminated by tenant's incapacity.</b> - Joint tenancies in bank and stock investment accounts and in real property did not terminate as a matter of law when one of the joint tenants was declared incapacitated and a guardian was appointed for the incapacitated individual's person and property. A guardian, unlike a trustee, has no beneficial title in the ward's estate, but is merely a custodian or manager. Moore v. Self, 222 Ga. App. 71, 473 S.E.2d 507 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Two parties having joint control of account does not make deposits therein a gift</b> from one to the other when there was no relinquishment of dominion by the original depositor such as would create a gift in presenti.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Joint property not property of trust estate.</b> - Funds, which had been deposited by a trust donor from a joint account in the names of one of the beneficiaries, the donor, and the trustee had been used prior to the donor's death to purchase securities in the name of the donor and the trustee as joint tenants; those securities properly belonged to the trustee as the surviving party under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§§</span> 7-1-813(a) and 14-5-8, and did not belong to the trust estate.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to pay judgment.</b> - Strictly limited to the plain meaning of the language employed in the Georgia Residential Mortgage Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-1017(a)(1), does not mandate that a mortgage lender pay a judgment within 30 days, but rather, the statute simply gives the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance the discretion to suspend or revoke a mortgage lender's license for failure to pay, within 30 days of it becoming final, a judgment arising from the lender's mortgage business; this statutorily-created administrative remedy cannot be extended beyond its plain terms to create an additional private cause of action against a mortgage lender's bond based on a failure to pay a judgment. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. iFreedom Direct Corp., 312 Ga. App. 262, 718 S.E.2d 103 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0408, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 246 (Ga. 2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Alternative language used in the Georgia Residential Mortgage Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-1017(a)(1), stating that the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance may revoke a license for a violation of the Act or failure to pay a final judgment, clearly shows that violating the Act and failing to pay a judgment are separate and distinct matters. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. iFreedom Direct Corp., 312 Ga. App. 262, 718 S.E.2d 103 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0408, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 246 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Acts not covered by bond.</b> - Trial court erred in granting a purchaser summary judgment and in denying an insurer summary judgment in the purchaser's action to recover against a bond the insurer issued to a mortgage lender under the Georgia Residential Mortgage Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-1-1000 et seq., because the acts that gave rise to the judgment the purchaser obtained against the lender occurred before the bond was in effect, and the lender's failure to pay the judgment was not an act that authorized recovery against the bond; the bond did not contain a specific covenant extending liability to acts prior to the bond's execution. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. iFreedom Direct Corp., 312 Ga. App. 262, 718 S.E.2d 103 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0408, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 246 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p13">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever it shall appear to the department that any person required to be licensed or registered under this article or employed by a licensee or who would be covered by the prohibitions in Code Section 7-1-1013 has violated any law of this state or any order or regulation of the department, the department may issue an initial written order requiring such person to cease and desist immediately from such unauthorized practices. Such cease and desist order shall be final 20 days after it is issued unless the person to whom it is issued makes a written request within such 20 day period for a hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." A cease and desist order to an unlicensed person that orders such person to cease doing a mortgage business without the appropriate license shall be final 30 days from the date of issuance, and there shall be no opportunity for an administrative hearing. If the proper license or evidence of exemption or valid employment status during the time of the alleged offense is delivered to the department within the 30 day period, the order shall be rescinded by the department. If a cease and desist order is issued to a person who has been sent a notice of bond cancellation and if the bond is reinstated or replaced and such documentation is delivered to the department within the 30 day period following the date of issuance of the order, the order shall be rescinded. If the notice of reinstatement of the bond is not received within the 30 days, the license shall expire at the end of the 30 day period, and the person shall be required to make a new application for license and pay the applicable fees. In the case of an unlawful purchase of mortgage loans, such initial cease and desist order to a purchaser shall constitute the knowledge required under subsection (b) of Code Section 7-1-1002 for any subsequent violations. Any cease and desist order sent to the person at both his or her personal and business addresses pursuant to this Code section that is returned to the department as "refused" or "unclaimed" shall be deemed as received and sufficiently served. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever a person shall fail to comply with the terms of an order of the department which has been properly issued under the circumstances, the department, upon notice of three days to such person, may, through the Attorney General, petition the principal court for an order directing such person to obey the order of the department within the period of time as shall be fixed by the court. Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall allow a motion to show cause why it should not be granted. Whenever, after a hearing upon the merits or after failure of such person to appear when ordered, it shall appear that the order of the department was properly issued, the court shall grant the petition of the department. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any person who violates the terms of any order issued pursuant to this Code section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation per day unless otherwise agreed to by the department. In determining the amount of penalty, the department shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty relative to the size of the financial resources of such person, the good faith efforts of such person to comply with the order, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations by such person, and such other factors or circumstances as shall have contributed to the violation. The department may at its discretion compromise, modify, or refund any penalty which is subject to imposition or has been imposed pursuant to this Code section. Any person assessed as provided in this subsection shall have the right to request a hearing into the matter within ten days after notification of the assessment has been served upon the person involved; otherwise, such penalty shall be final except as to judicial review as provided in Code Section 7-1-90. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of the Georgia Industrial Loan Act (see now O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s2"><b>§</b></span><b> 7-3-1 et seq.)</b> is to eliminate abuses arising from unregulated entities engaging in small loan business.

<p class="p4">Purpose of the Georgia Industrial Loan Act (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.) is to provide a source of regulated lending funds since such need existed for those who had been borrowing at usurious rates from loan sharks, street shylocks, and wage-buyers. Freeman v. Decatur Loan &amp; Fin. Corp., 140 Ga. App. 682, 231 S.E.2d 409 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Georgia Industrial Loan Act (see now O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s2"><b>§</b></span><b> 7-3-1 et seq.) was designed to require creditors to make certain uniform disclosures</b> in consumer credit transactions in order to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to the consumers and avoid uninformed use of credit.

<p class="p4"><b>Chapter to be read liberally and broadly.</b> - Wording and legislative history of the Georgia Industrial Loan Act (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.) make clear that it is to be read liberally and broadly to prevent even the most subtle or indirect methods of assessing usurious rates.

It in no way discourages judicial or other valid authority from seeking interpretations of the Act which further its purpose, despite prior inconsistent interpretations. Ford v.

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial construction of the Retail Installment and Home Solicitation Sales Act,</b> O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 10-1-1 et seq., enacted at a different time, is weak evidence of legislative intent in enacting the Georgia Industrial Loan Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.

<p class="p4"><b>Rule of 78's can be used to compute interest rebates.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq. authorizes the lender to use the Rule of 78's to compute interest rebates in refinancing cases and does not require lenders to compute such rebates on a pro rata basis.

<p class="p4"><b>Penalty for omission in original agreement.</b> - A 1979 debt was not uncollectible because the original 1977 agreement violated the Georgia Industrial Loan Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq., by failing to provide for rebates of unearned credit insurance premiums. However, as a penalty for this violation, the loan company had to forfeit all interest and charges accrued in connection with the 1977 agreement. Varner v. Century Fin.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of accelerating debt on insurance coverage.</b> - In the absence of any requirement that a lender cancel credit insurance coverage upon acceleration of a debt, there is no violation of this chapter when a lender, pursuant to properly drafted loan documents and in accord with this chapter, accelerates a debt but does not refund insurance premiums on insurance coverage still in effect.

The relevant question is not simply whether a violation exists in the contract, when evaluated under general rules of contract construction, but whether the lender might be able to employ certain provisions of the contract to exact illegal charges from unsuspecting debtors.

<p class="p4"><b>Federal savings and loan associations are exempted.</b> - Consumer loans for amounts less than $3,000.00, with interest charged in excess of 9 percent simple interest would be governed by the Georgia Industrial Loan Act (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.), but the Act grants specific exemptions from its provisions to "banks, trust companies, real estate loan or mortgage companies, federal and Georgia building and loan associations".

On all contracts, interest or discount shall be computed proportionately on equal calendar months; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(2) L<span class="s2">OAN FEE.</span> In addition thereto, a licensee may charge, contract for, receive, or collect at the time the loan is made a fee in an amount not greater than 8 percent of the first $600.00 of the face amount of the contract plus 4 percent of the excess; provided, however, that such fee shall not be charged or collected on that part of a loan which is used to pay or apply on a prior loan or installment of a prior loan from the same licensee to the same borrower made within the immediately preceding six-month period; provided, however, if the loan balance is $300.00 or less, the said period shall be two months, not six months; provided, further, that nothing contained in this paragraph and paragraph (1) of this Code section shall be construed to permit charges, interest, or fees of any nature whatsoever in the aggregate in excess of the charges, interest, and fees which would constitute a violation of Code Section 7-4-18 and this chapter shall in no way affect Code Section 7-4-18. If a borrower prepays his or her entire loan to a licensee and within the following 15 days makes a new loan with that licensee and if this is done within the six-month period or the two-month period above described, as may be applicable, the fee may be charged only on the excess by which the face amount of the new contract exceeds the amount which the borrower repaid to that licensee within the said 15 day period; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(3) I<span class="s2">NSURANCE PREMIUMS.</span> A licensee may charge and collect from the borrower premiums actually paid or to be paid for insurance obtained for the borrower. A licensee may accept as security on any loan or advance made under this chapter any one or any combination of the following: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(A) Insurance on tangible property against substantial risks or loss; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(B) Reasonable insurance on the life and health of the principal party; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(C) Reasonable insurance against accident of the principal party;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p13">provided, however, that any such insurance shall be reasonably related to the type and value of the property insured and to the amount and term of the loan and shall be obtained from an insurance company authorized to conduct such business in the State of Georgia and at rates lawfully filed by such company with the Commissioner of Insurance and through a regular insurance agent licensed by the Commissioner of Insurance; provided, further, the amount of life, health, or accident insurance required as security for loans made under this chapter shall not exceed the amount of the loan, including charges, to be secured; and the premiums on such insurance required of the principal party obligated shall be limited to premiums reasonably based upon reliable actuarial experience and sound insurance practice; and the Commissioner is authorized and directed to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate this provision in accordance with the spirit and intent thereof. It shall be the duty of the Commissioner from time to time under the foregoing direction, after public hearing in the manner provided in subsection (b) of Code Section 7-3-7, to determine and promulgate the rates and maximum premiums permissible to be charged for life, health, and accident insurance required as security for a loan made under this chapter and to make regulations incident thereto necessary to effectuate the same; such premiums, when thus established and as changed from time to time in the manner aforesaid, shall be the maximum effective and permissible charges under this paragraph. Premiums paid or to be paid pursuant to the authority of this paragraph shall not constitute interest. The insurance company in turn may pay to the party writing the insurance policy sold in connection with the loan a fee or commission in an amount which is reasonable in relationship to the transaction and in no event in excess of the amount of fee or commission customarily paid within the industry where comparable insurance is sold in a transaction not involving credit, as determined by the Commissioner; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(4) L<span class="s2">ATE CHARGE.</span> A licensee may charge and collect from the borrower a late or delinquent charge of $10.00 or an amount equal to 5<span class="s4">›</span> for each $1.00 of any installment which is not paid within five days from the date such payment is due, whichever is greater, provided that this late or delinquent charge shall not be collected more than once for the same default; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(5) M<span class="s2">AINTENANCE CHARGE.</span> In addition thereto, a licensee may contract for, charge, receive, and collect a maintenance charge of $3.00 for each month in the term of the loan contract on each loan made, whether repayable in one single payment or repayable in weekly, monthly, or other periodic installments. Refunds of unearned maintenance charges shall be made in accordance with the method prescribed in Code Section 7-3-17, and such maintenance charges will be subject to paragraph (4) of this Code section. Nothing contained in Code Section 7-4-18, as now or hereafter amended, shall be construed to apply to this paragraph; and loans made in conformity with this paragraph shall in no way constitute a violation of Code Section 7-4-18, as now or hereafter amended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p13"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of subsections (g) and (h) of O.C.G.A <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-29, decisions rendered prior to amendment of that section by Ga. L. 1980, p. 1784, <span class="s2">§§</span> 1, 2 have been included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose.</b> - In enacting O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-14, the General Assembly was concerned with the possible exorbitant and unmerited exaction of profits by the original lender in a renewal or refinancing. Although there is nothing to indicate that the General Assembly specifically considered the "anti-competition" problem, the clear thrust and underlying policy of this legislation is to provide some protection to debtors in small loan transactions, while there is no indication that solicitude for second lenders was even a minor policy consideration. Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Policy consideration underlying usury laws.</b> - Purpose of the Georgia Industrial Loan Act (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.) is to define and prevent usury. One consideration underlying the usury laws is that a creditor should not avail oneself of the necessitous condition of one's debtor to exact<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>burdensome and oppressive terms. Securities Inv. Co. v. Pearson, 111 Ga. App. 761, 143 S.E.2d 36 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loan may not exceed three years.</b> - It is immaterial whether interest is charged for less than 24 months (now 36 months and 15 days); former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 25-315 plainly stated that the loan may not exceed two years (now three years, 15 days). Abrams v. Commercial Credit Plan, Inc., 128 Ga. App. 520, 197 S.E.2d 384 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section prohibits loans to a borrower which exceed $3,000.00.</b> - When a statute provides that every licensee thereunder may loan any sum of money not exceeding $3,000.00 it means that the company cannot be a creditor to any particular person, firm, or corporation at any one time for an amount in excess of this maximum. It may make any number of loans, so long as the debtors are different persons. Securities Inv. Co. v. Pearson, 111 Ga. App. 761, 143 S.E.2d 36 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section 1-3-1 inapplicable to this section.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 102-102 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 1-3-1) applied only when days are to be counted, and when months and years are to be considered, as in former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 25-315, the rule was not applicable. Gray v. Quality Fin. Co., 130 Ga. App. 762, 204 S.E.2d 483 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When state law is inconsistent with truth in lending law.</b> - State law is inconsistent with requirements of truth in lending law if it requires creditor to make disclosures different from those required by federal law as to form, content, terminology, or time of delivery. Blalock v. Aetna Fin. Co., 511 F. Supp. 33 (N.D. Ga. 1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of out-of-state banks by loan companies.</b> - Loan companies were not entitled to declaratory judgment relief on the companies' claim that the companies were not in violation of the Georgia Industrial Loan Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq., for certain practices the companies were allegedly engaged in because the companies were using an out-of-state bank to make the companies' loans through that bank, and, thus, were not subject to the Act as the industrial loan commissioner had not ruled on whether the practice of using an out-of-state bank exempted the companies from the Act, which meant the companies had not exhausted the administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. USA Payday Cash Advance Ctrs. v. Oxendine, 262 Ga. App. 632, 585 S.E.2d 924 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refinancing by original lender.</b> - In a refinancing by an original lender, when both sides must agree to an extension of credit and the lender presumably is not losing profits, there is no reason to depart from the general mandate of O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§§</span> 7-3-14 and 7-3-15. O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 already provides for "add on" interest, earned uniformly on the entire original amount of the loan, without regard to installment reductions in the outstanding balance. Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Renewal by original lender less costly than by second lender.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 distinguishes between original and second lenders with the result that a renewal or refinancing by an original lender is less costly than if effected by a second lender. Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment properly denied.</b> - In a class action suit seeking to hold a lender liable for payday loans, the trial court did not err in concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the lender was the true lender of the loans made after May 14, 2004, because evidence was presented sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the lender actually received only a 49 percent economic interest for the lender's services and even if the lender did so, whether the lender nevertheless, by contrivance, device, or scheme, attempted to avoid the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 16-17-2(a).

<p class="p4"><b>Advance discounts of interest.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-14 does not provide a flexibility period for loans qualifying for the advance discount and a loan due in 18 months and 15 days exceeds the limit authorized by the statute.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Note on which interest was deducted in advance void.</b> - When in suit by licensee against borrower the note attached to the petition shows that the loan was for a period exceeding 18 months and shows on the loan's face that interest was deducted in advance rather than added to the loan, such deduction resulted in a charge exceeding that authorized in former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 25-315 and rendered the note void. Community Fin. Co. v. Lloyd, 114 Ga. App. 230, 150 S.E.2d 845 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interest included in loan cannot be discounted in advance.</b> - When the maximum interest for the 24-month note had already been calculated and included in the loan it could not be discounted in advance, and an attempt to accelerate and claim unearned interest on otherwise unmatured installments was usurious and an instrument authorizing its collection is void. Lawrimore v. Sun Fin. Co., 131 Ga. App. 96, 205 S.E.2d 110 (1974) (decided prior to 1980 amendment of <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-29).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lender's options and duty regarding collection of loan fee and basic interest.</b> - Lender has option with respect to how loan fee is collected and with respect to how basic interest is collected on loans repayable in 18 months or less, but must add on interest for loans repayable over a period in excess of 18 months. In this latter instance the basic interest fee will never be required to be denoted as prepaid finance charge, while in the two former instances it will depend on how lender collects the loan fee and/or basic interest. Slatter v. Aetna Fin. Co., 377 F. Supp. 806 (N.D. Ga. 1974), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Jones v. Community Loan &amp; Inv.

<p class="p4"><b>Section compensates lender for profits lost when loan prepaid.</b> - In enacting O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-17, the General Assembly made a specific exception to the general limitation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-14 on interest and to the general prohibition in O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-15 on further charges, with a view toward compensating a lender for lost profits when a debtor voluntarily repays the debtor's loan. Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section applicable to prepaid interest and insurance but makes no mention of loan fee charges.</b> - Georgia law provides a specific refund system upon prepayment of loans. It applies to prepaid interest and insurance charges but makes no mention of a loan fee charge. Jones v. Community Loan &amp; Inv. Corp., 526 F.2d 642 (5th Cir.), on rehearing, 544 F.2d 1228 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 934, 97 S. Ct. 2642, 53 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rule of 78's violates this section.</b> - Given the purpose of the Industrial Loan Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq., the strict construction which Georgia courts have applied to it, its general limitation on interest rates charged on such small loans in O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-14, its general prohibition in O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-15 on charges in excess of those authorized, and the commission regulations, which, according to accepted interpretive principles, appear to exclude anything but pro rata computations of interest on rebates and refinancing, it would seem that the use of the Rule of 78's to compute the interest rebate and the refinancing of a loan agreement pursuant to that Act violates O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-17. Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determination of refund by Rule of 78's is permitted.</b> - Computation of refunds of unearned interest according to Rule of 78's when borrower pays time balance in full before maturity is permitted. Pollard v. Congress Fin. Corp., 153 Ga. App. 357, 265 S.E.2d 296 (1980). (But see, Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rule of 78's applicable in refinancing situation.</b> - One statute the General Assembly has written to allow for use of the Rule of 78's in situations involving the prepayment of all or any part of the unpaid balance of an installment contract prior to maturity should be held applicable when a borrower retires one note held by a particular lender by using the proceeds of a second note from the same lender. The General Assembly's decision to allow more than a pro rata loss of interest in prepayment situations indicates the General Assembly's desire to allow a similar loss by the borrower in a refinancing situation since both transactions are initiated by the borrower and are evidences of the borrower's failure to fulfill the borrower's contractual obligation to repay the lender pursuant to the initial installment contract. That failure has caused the General Assembly to exact a penalty against the borrower in the form of allowing a creditor's use of the Rule of 78's in a prepayment situation, and in the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, the same penalty should be exacted against the refinancing borrower. Simpson v. Termplan, Inc., 535 F. Supp. 36 (N.D. Ga. 1981). (But see, Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981)). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Industrial Loan Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq., authorizes the lender to use the Rule of 78's to compute interest rebates in refinancing cases and the Act does not require lenders to compute such rebates on a pro rata basis. Varner v. Century Fin. Corp., 253 Ga. 27, 317 S.E.2d 178 (1984). (But see, Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Nothing less than refund of all unearned interest permitted when creditor accelerates.</b> - When there is not a prepayment, the Rule of 78's cannot be used to compute interest refund and when acceleration was made at half-way point in contract but less than 50 percent of total interest charged was refunded, nothing less than a refund of all unearned interest when the creditor accelerates can be permitted.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction.</b> - This law, being in derogation of common law, must be strictly construed. Landmark Fin. Corp. v. Cox, 2 Bankr. 739 (S.D. Ga. 1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Georgia courts have strictly construed the Georgia Industrial Loan Act (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.) since its provisions are in derogation of common law.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section does not discourage judicial or other interpretation of chapter.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-29 evinces a recognition on the part of the General Assembly that the Georgia Industrial Loan Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq., is ambiguous in certain sections. It in no way discourages judicial or other valid authority from seeking interpretations of that Act which further its purpose, despite prior inconsistent interpretations. Ford v.

<p class="p4">The 1978 additions to the penalty provision did not eliminate the null and void language. In describing the purpose of these additions, the General Assembly stated that the former provisions (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-29(f)) were intended to exempt from certain penalties contracts made in reliance upon certain rules, regulations, or interpretations of the act.

Enforcing the class action waiver in this contractual action would undermine the purpose and spirit of Georgia's statutory scheme; therefore, the class action waiver was unenforceable. Davis v.

<p class="p4"><b>Collection of unearned interest is not per se improper</b> under Georgia law. Barrett v. Vernie Jones Ford, Inc., 395 F. Supp. 904 (N.D.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceleration clause enforceable unless rendering note usurious.</b> - Acceleration clause not providing for rebate of unearned interest is enforceable absent finding that clause, as applied, renders note violative of state usury laws. Once such finding has been made, however, the note becomes void. Barrett v. Vernie Jones Ford, Inc., 395 F. Supp. 904 (N.D. Ga. 1975), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. McDaniel v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceleration clause which includes unearned interest voids the contract.</b> - Provision for acceleration of unearned interest is a contract authorizing collection of more than is provided or approved by the Industrial Loan Act, (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.) and thus authorizes a result contrary to its terms, and is in violation of the Act; thus, the loan is void. Frazier v. Courtesy Fin. Co., 132 Ga. App. 365, 208 S.E.2d 175 (1974);(decided prior to 1980 amendment of this section). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Barrett v. Vernie Jones Ford, Inc., 395 F. Supp. 904 (N.D. Ga. 1975), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. McDaniel v.

<p class="p4">Acceleration clause in Industrial Loan Act, (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq.) contract which upon default permits the collection of entire balance due on contract without excluding unearned interest, is violative of the Act and voids contract. Diggs v. Swift Loan &amp; Fin. Co., 154 Ga. App. 389, 268 S.E.2d 433 (1980) (decided prior to 1980 amendment of this section).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Fulton Nat'l Bank, 543 F.2d 568 (5th Cir. 1976), aff'd, 578 F.2d 1185 (5th Cir. 1978) (decided prior to 1980 amendment of this Code section).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p13"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Policy of state.</b> - It is the policy of laws of this state to inhibit taking of usury under every and any pretense or contrivance whatsoever. McGehee v. Petree, 165 Ga. 492, 141 S.E. 206 (1928); Public Fin. Corp. v. State, 67 Ga. App. 635, 21 S.E.2d 476 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction and application of section with </b><span class="s2"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>7-4-18. - Former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§§</span> 57-102, 57-117 and 57-9901 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§§</span> 7-4-1 and 7-4-18) are to be construed and applied as one law. Wall v. Lewis, 192 Ga. 652, 16 S.E.2d 430 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Usury."</b> - Usury is excess over legal interest charged by lender to borrower for use of lender's money. Sledd v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 52 Ga. App. 326, 183 S.E. 199 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Four requisites of usurious transactions.</b> - There are four requisites of every usurious transaction: (1) a loan or forebearance of money, either express or implied; (2) upon understanding that principal shall or may be returned; (3) that for such loan or forebearance a greater profit than is authorized by law shall be paid or is agreed to be paid; and (4) that the contract was made with intent to violate the law. Bailey v. Newberry, 52 Ga. App. 693, 184 S.E. 357 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Substance of transaction is focus in determining whether transaction is usurious.</b> - It is duty of court to look, not at form and words, but at substance of transaction. Rushing v. Worsham &amp; Co., 102 Ga. 825, 30 S.E. 541 (1898); Young v. First Nat'l Bank, 22 Ga. App. 58, 95 S.E. 381 (1918).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Usurious original transaction infects renewal.</b> - Contract for usurious loan not purged of usury by renewal note when original contract continues. Hammond v. Buys, 1 Ga. 416 (1846). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If there was usury in the original loan which was not purged out when renewal was given, they are contaminated just as original contract was, and all payments made in interval are to be treated not as payments of usury, but payments made on original debt. Archer v. McCray, 59 Ga. 546 (1877); McGee v. Long, 83 Ga. 156, 9 S.E. 1107 (1889); Lockwood v. Muhlberg, 124 Ga. 660, 53 S.E. 92 (1906). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When original transaction was usurious, the usury infects any renewal note for the same debt or any part thereof, if the usury was never purged. Hartsfield Co. v. Watkins, 67 Ga. App. 411, 20 S.E.2d 440 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Usurious contract not cured by compromise and settlement for less.</b> - Since usury consists not only in reserving and taking but in contracting to reserve and take more than legal rate, fact that agreed excess was compromised and settled for a less amount would not free a transaction from usury. Lankford v. Holton, 187 Ga. 94, 200 S.E. 243 (1938), later appeal, 195 Ga. 317, 24 S.E.2d 292 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When undisputed pleadings show usurious scheme, judgment on pleadings appropriate.</b> - When facts show without dispute a device to extract more than legal rate of interest for use of money, such question need not be submitted to the jury. Accordingly, when undisputed pleadings show such a scheme, it is not error for the trial court to grant the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings under provisions of <span class="s2">§</span> 12(c) of the Civil Practice Act (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>9-11-12(c)).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Usury laws did not apply to an investment contract.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a purchaser in a breach of contract suit against a developer as the award the purchaser obtained, which included interest, was not usurious under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-1 as the developer failed to show that the contract involved was a loan to which the usury laws applied as the record established it as an investment contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Mistake or inadvertence does not make a loan usurious.</b> - To constitute usury it is essential that there be, at the time the contract is executed, an intent on the part of the lender to take or charge for use of money a higher rate of interest than that allowed by law. If the intent be to take only legal interest, a slight and trifling excess, due to mistake or inadvertence, will not taint the transaction with usury. Cook v.

<p class="p4"><b>Rebuttal of intent by evidence of honest mistake.</b> - Implication of usurious intent arising from taking or reserving of interest greater than legal rate may be rebutted by evidence that excess was the result of an honest mistake and that usury was not intended. But when evidence is clear, this question can be decided as a matter of law. McCrory v. Young, 158 Ga. App. 678, 282 S.E.2d 163 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>"Usury."</b> - Usury is not the taking of interest from a borrower at an unlawful rate, but rather it is receiving from any source a greater sum for use of money than the lawful interest. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-53.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When interest plus points or loan discount exceed legal limit, loan usurious.</b> - When interest rate charged borrower coupled with points or loan discount collected from seller exceed legal limit, such loan is usurious; the standard charges in a loan transaction are not included in this computation if those charges are expended in a bona fide manner. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-53.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrying charges limited to legal rate plus actual expenses.</b> - When no distinction is made between cash price and time price of an article, carrying charges are limited to legal rate of interest, plus any actual expense incurred by vendor incident to the sale, such as fee for recording a security instrument and reasonable protective insurance. 1954-56 Op.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p13">(a) (1) (A)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The legal rate of interest shall be 7 percent per annum simple interest where the rate percent is not established by written contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of other laws to the contrary, except Code Section 7-4-18, the parties may establish by written contract any rate of interest, expressed in simple interest terms as of the date of the evidence of the indebtedness, and charges and any manner of repayment, prepayment, or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section, acceleration, where the principal amount involved is more than $3,000.00 but less than $250,000.00 or where the lender or creditor has committed to lend, advance, or forbear with respect to any loan, advance, or forbearance to enforce the collection of more than $3,000.00 but less than $250,000.00. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(B) Where the principal amount is $250,000.00 or more, or the lender or creditor has committed to lend, advance, or forbear with respect to any loan, advance, or forbearance to enforce the collection of $250,000.00 or more, the parties may establish by written contract any rate of interest, expressed in simple interest terms or otherwise, and charges to be paid by the borrower or debtor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(C) Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the computation and collection of interest at a variable rate or on a negative amortization basis or on an equity participation basis or on an appreciation basis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(2) Where the principal amount involved is $3,000.00 or less, such rate shall not exceed 16 percent per annum simple interest on any loan, advance, or forbearance to enforce the collection of any sum of money unless the loan, advance, or forbearance to enforce the collection of any sum of money is made pursuant to another law. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(3) As used in this Code section, the term "interest" means a charge for the use of money computed over the term of the contract at the rate stated in the contract or precomputed at a stated rate on the scheduled principal balance or computed in any other way or any other form. Principal includes such charges to which the parties may agree under paragraph (1) of this subsection. Amounts paid or contracted to be paid as either an origination fee or discount points, or both, on any loan secured by an interest in real estate shall not be considered interest and shall not be taken into consideration in the calculation of interest and shall not be subject to rebate as provided in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upon acceleration of the maturity of any loan, advance of money, or forbearance to enforce the collection of any sum of money upon which interest has been precomputed, unearned interest shall be rebated to the debtor in such amount as would result in the rate of interest earned being no greater than the rate of interest established by the original contract. In the case of a loan in which the principal and the interest for the entire term of the loan are included in the face amount of the loan and the loan is to be paid back in weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or yearly installments, with the interest and principal portions of each installment determined under the pro rata method, any such rebate shall be determined on the pro rata method. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p13"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - Many of the cases cited below were decided under this Code section as it read prior to the 1983 amendment, which extensively rewrote this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - Purpose of the statute against usury is, at most, only a check on the conscience of the lender. The necessity to borrow on one hand, and greed on the other, prompted the legislature, no doubt, to fix from time to time a limit on the value of money. This value is merely arbitrary in the legislative mind. Green v. Equitable Mtg. Co., 107 Ga. 536, 33 S.E. 869 (1899).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State law applied.</b> - In a suit seeking to confirm an arbitration award, a corporation was entitled to an award of interest in accordance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-2(a)(1)(A) on any unpaid portion of the arbitration award for the period between when the award was made and when the court entered final judgment confirming the award; state law, rather than federal law, applied because the court's jurisdiction was based on diversity. Bryant Motors, Inc. v. Blue Bird Body Co.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(M.D. Ga. Aug. 22, 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Comparison with federal rate.</b> - At the relevant times asserted in an adversary proceeding asserted by a Chapter 7 trustee, the legal rate of interest under 28 U.S.C. <span class="s2">§</span> 1961 was less than the Georgia legal rate of interest of seven percent. Silliman v. Benson (In re Metro Builders Supply, Inc.),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Oct. 4, 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rate chargeable when not named in contract.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s2">§</span> 57-101 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-102) sets forth interest rate chargeable when none is named in contract. Hopkins v. West Publishing Co., 106 Ga. App. 596, 127 S.E.2d 849 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between legal interest and lawful interest.</b> - Generally, the terms legal interest and lawful interest have different meanings. The former means exact rate of interest named in statute, while latter means anything up to maximum rate which law allows. Daniel v. Gibson, 72 Ga. 367, 53 Am. R. 845 (1884).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legal interest rates are prima facie "equitable"</b> and any award deviating from the legal rates must be based on sufficient evidence demonstrating that another rate is appropriate. Atlantic States Constr., Inc. v. Beavers, 169 Ga. App. 584, 314 S.E.2d 245 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Promise of liberal interest will not justify more than the legal interest.</b> Weaver v. Chauncey, 43 Ga. 343 (1871).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Usurious contracts unlawful only as to usurious interest.</b> - Contracts to pay usury are unlawful, but only as to the usurious interest; but mere illegality in consideration is not sufficient to defeat rights of an innocent holder.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Substance of transaction controls.</b> - Law recognizes a seller's right to make a difference in the seller's cash price and the seller's time price for the seller's property; and, though in a given instance this difference may exceed the maximum allowable rate, usury laws are not applicable. If, however, property is sold at a cash price, and time is given by vendor to purchaser upon a portion of the purchase money, and a greater rate of interest than that allowed by law is charged on such deferred payments, the contract is usurious. Murdock Acceptance Corp. v. Wagnon, 587 F.2d 764 (5th Cir. 1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it is lawful and not usurious to charge one price for property sold for cash and a higher price for same property if sold on credit, if contract is that property be sold at cash valuation, and that certain payments are to be deferred in consideration of a greater rate of interest than that allowed by law, such contract is usurious.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence rule inapplicable to usurious contracts.</b> - While it is well established that parol evidence cannot be used to add to or change terms of valid written contract, the rule does not apply to contract which is usurious and, therefore, invalid.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of device by which lender exacts usurious interest.</b> - If agreement is a mere device or subterfuge by which one party was permitted to charge a higher than lawful rate of interest for a loan of money, the agreement would be usurious, and the lender can collect no interest at all.

<p class="p6"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - Many of the opinions cited below were rendered under this Code section as it read prior to the 1983 amendment, which extensively rewrote this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Usury defined.</b> - Usury is not the taking of interest from the borrower at an unlawful rate, but rather it is receiving from any source a greater sum for use of money than the lawful interest. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-53.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrying charges are limited to legal rate plus actual expenses incurred.</b> - When no distinction is made between cash price and time price of an article, carrying charges are limited to legal rate of interest, plus any actual expense incurred by vendor incident to sale, such as fee for recording security instrument and reasonable protective insurance. 1954-56 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 448.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Service charge probably usurious.</b> - If monthly service charge plan does not come within any specific exception set out by state law, then charge of one to one and a half percent per month of unpaid balance would probably be usurious. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-45.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with Industrial Loan Act.</b> - Merchant who makes cash advances of $3,000.00 or less is subject to the provisions of the Georgia Industrial Loan Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-3-1 et seq., rather than O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-2(a)(2), unless the merchant charges eight percent simple interest per annum or less. 1984 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 84-79.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loan or origination fee.</b> - If a loan or origination fee charged in connection with a non-real estate loan under $3,000 is not adduced based on the time value of money, if its use merely increases the lender's expectation of collecting in full the principal amount of the loan plus interest or if the fee is attributable to a service or benefit other than the extension of credit, and if the fee's factual justification is clearly documented in sufficient detail, such a fee should not be considered prepaid interest. 2003 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2003-8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Overdraft fees.</b> - Overdraft fee will not be considered interest when the transaction is readily characterized as a checking account transaction, lacking the legal and economic reality of a loan or extension of credit, and when the fee is not determined based on the amount and time value of overdraft amounts. 2003 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2003-9.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Tender of principal required prior to intervention to prevent foreclosure.</b> - Before a borrower who has executed a deed infected with usury can have affirmative equitable relief, such as injunction to prevent exercise of power of sale by grantee in such security deed, the borrower must pay or tender to the grantee the principal sum due.

<p class="p4"><b>Subsection (d) not complete bar.</b> - Rather than concluding that O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-10(d) acts as a complete bar to actions filed more than a year after contract formation, the courts interpreting that section have held that the statute bars only actions to affirmatively recover interest paid more than a year before the action was instituted. Doyle v. Southern Guar. Corp., 795 F.2d 907 (11th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 926, 108 S. Ct. 289, 98 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Subsection (d) does not prevent plea claiming credit towards principal.</b> - When a lender charges for use of money a greater rate of interest than is permitted by law, the whole charge for interest is forfeited, and all payments made by debtor may be claimed by the debtor as credits upon the principal sum loaned; to such claim, no matter when payments were made, statutory bar of one year is not applicable; and this is true even though the debtor may have given express direction that payments be applied to interest.

App. 251, 274 S.E.2d 648 (1980); Plowden v. Peoples Fin. Corp. (In re Pair), 14 Bankr. 732 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plea of usury is personal and because the usury laws protect the debtor, not the debt, the parties' various rights concerning the debt belongs to them only so long as they remain within a lender-borrower relationship. Lindenberg v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 528 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 691 F.2d 974 (11th Cir. 1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Counterclaim or separate suit unnecessary.</b> - Usury is a defense and need not be asserted as a counterclaim or in separate suit. Williams v. First Bank &amp; Trust Co., 154 Ga. App. 879, 269 S.E.2d 923 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Before defense raised, obligation to pay indebtedness prima facie valid.</b> - Defense of usury is a matter personal to the debtor and, before the debtor has made such defense, the debtor's obligation to pay the indebtedness infected with usury is prima facie valid. Napier v. Jordan, 52 Ga. App. 585, 183 S.E. 854 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to raise defense of usury precludes attack levy of execution.</b> - Debtor who has had the debtor's day in court will not be heard to attack levy of execution on ground that the debt was infected with usury. Wilkinson v. Holton, 119 Ga. 557, 46 S.E. 620 (1904); Clark v. Kaiser Agric. Chems., 156 Ga. App. 251, 274 S.E.2d 648 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Advertisement of collateral not tortious when defense not raised.</b> - Fact that after creditor has advertised property for sale for payment of a usurious debt, the debtor, in a bill in equity to enjoin sale, sets up usury and shows that the debtor has paid all that the debtor was legally liable for, and obtains a judgment against the creditor for an amount which debtor overpaid, does not so relate as to give any tortious character to the creditor's original act in advertising property for sale.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creditor of insolvent may attack claim of another creditor as usurious.</b> - While plea of usury is a personal one which can be set up by a debtor only, when the debtor is insolvent and there is a fund in court to be distributed, equity will allow one creditor to suggest usury as to claim of another, and compel usurious creditor to write off usury and receive only principal and legal interest.

<p class="p4"><b>Rate of interest.</b> - Generally interest on a judgment is to be calculated at seven percent (now 12 percent) per annum from date of judgment until payment, but when contract or note upon which action is based specifies a different rate, or when interest is prescribed by statute, the judgment thereon bears interest from the date of judgment at contract rate or at statutory rate.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred when the court imposed a fixed rate of interest on a judgment obtained by a class of retirees in their action against the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia, arising from their claims that they were not paid the appropriate amounts for their retirement benefits, as there was no pre- or post-judgment interest rate established by the written contract between the parties that governed those payments, such that the statutory rates of seven percent and prime plus three percent should have been applied pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§§</span> 7-4-2(a)(1)(A) and 7-4-12(a); another interest rate that was set by the System in a regulation was not applicable to the instant matter.

<p class="p4">Husband's concern about the interest rate of 11.25 percent imposed on an award of attorneys fees was justified under circumstances in which the husband asserted that the date of the judgment was October 1, 2007, and the applicable prime rate was seven and three quarters percent, while the wife argued that the applicable prime rate was eight and one quarter percent, the rate on July 20, 2007, the day the trial court orally pronounced the court's judgment; however, an oral pronouncement was not a judgment. It had to have been reduced to writing and entered as a judgment to have been effective. Mongerson v.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Res judicata.</b> - Because the issue of interest on past due child support was not put in issue and decided in a prior contempt proceeding related to a father's failure to pay child support, res judicata did not bar a subsequent judgment for interest on the past due child support amounts; it is undisputed that O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-12.1 applies retroactively. Dial v. Adkins, 265 Ga. App. 650, 595 S.E.2d 332 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No enforceable contract to collect post-judgment interest on unpaid child support.</b> - Trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Office of Child Support enforcement, was upheld on appeal in a class action suit brought by a recipient challenging the department's failure to collect post-judgment interest on unpaid child support since a statement of understanding, though stating it was a contract, afforded complete discretion to the department in rendering services and used the vague term appropriate services, which rendered the purported agreement too vague and uncertain to be enforced as a contract.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Direction to waive or reduce interest owed.</b> - Court recognized that, under Georgia law, the court had discretion in determining whether to apply, waive, or reduce the amount of interest owed, but the court declined to exercise the court's discretion to waive or reduce the amount of interest owed because the criteria set out in O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-12.1 had not been met. Debtor had not provided any explanation for the nonpayment of child support, other than stating that the debtor could not afford to pay the child support, which was not what the statute contemplated.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retroactive application.</b> - Legislative intent of adopting O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-12.1 was to have it apply to all child support arrearages, regardless of whether arrearages accrued prior to July 1, 1996.

<p class="p4"><b>Law of place of performance governs interest.</b> - On contracts made in one state to be performed in another, if the contracts bear interest, the law of the state where the contracts are to be performed governs the rate of interest to be paid. Vinson v. Platt &amp; McKenzie, 21 Ga. 135 (1857). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">General rule that interest which contract shall bear is to be governed by law of place where it is to be performed applies to contracts legal where made. Martin v. Johnson, 84 Ga. 481, 10 S.E. 1092, 8 L.R.A. 170 (1890).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Choice of law provisions cannot create exemption from state investigation.</b> - Parties to a private contract who admittedly made loans to Georgia residents could not, by virtue of a choice of law provision, exempt themselves from investigation for potential violations of Georgia's usury laws. BankWest, Inc. v. Oxendine, 266 Ga. App. 771, 598 S.E.2d 343 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Dealings with foreign corporation governed by laws of its domicile.</b> - Dealings in Indiana with corporation chartered by that state are governed by its laws, and when attacked here for usury, provisions of such laws applicable to the transaction must be made to appear. Flournoy &amp; Epping v. First Nat'l Bank, 79 Ga. 810, 2 S.E. 547 (1887).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Place of preliminary negotiations does not determine place of contract.</b> - Since land was located in Georgia and all papers executed therein, mere fact that negotiations preliminary to execution of papers took place in Florida does not alter fact that this is a Georgia contract. First Nat'l Bank v. Rambo, 143 Ga. 665, 85 S.E. 840 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Federal law was intended to preempt conflicting state law</b> in the area of due-on-sale home loan assumption practices of federal savings and loan associations, and federal law permits the escalation of interest rates upon the assumption of a residential purchase loan when there is an appropriate provision in the contract. Lindenberg v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 691 F.2d 974 (11th Cir. 1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section applicable when note executed in another state.</b> - When note is executed and made payable in another state, even though secured by a deed to land in this state, the rate of interest on the note is governed by usury laws of the sister state. Jones v. Lawman, 56 Ga. App. 764, 194 S.E. 416 (1937); Clark v. Transouth Fin. Corp., 142 Ga. App. 389, 236 S.E.2d 135 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Georgia law applies when contract executed and payable in Georgia.</b> - Choice of law rule holds that when: (1) land held by security deed is in Georgia; (2) contract was executed in Georgia; and (3) contract was made payable in Georgia, law of usury applies as Georgia is place of performance of contract. FDIC v. Lattimore Land Corp., 656 F.2d 139 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of common law of Georgia.</b> - When a promissory note is both executed and to be performed in another state, in an attack by the maker upon a note for usury, in an action brought in this state against the maker by the holder, when laws of the foreign states regulating interest charges and usury do not appear, the common law will be presumed to be there in force, and the right to collect interest in such suit, unless contrary to public policy or specific statutes of this state, will be governed by common law as it has been construed and applied in this state. Folsom v. Continental Adjustment Corp., 48 Ga. App. 435, 172 S.E. 833 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When evidence is silent as to legal interest in another state, common law is presumed to govern, and a contract for reasonable interest is allowed. Thomas v. Clarkson, 125 Ga. 72, 54 S.E. 77, 6 L.R.A. (n.s.) 658 (1906); Ellington v. Harris, 127 Ga. 85, 56 S.E. 134, 119 Ann. Cas. 320 (1906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Subsequent agreements governed by laws as of date made.</b> - Parties are free to bargain away their rights, and once the borrower is released from liability, whether by novation, a loan modification, or any other means, subsequent agreements for repayments of the debt are governed by the laws as of the date they are made, and not the date of the creation of the debt. Lindenberg v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 528 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 691 F.2d 974 (11th Cir. 1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Transactions involving the assumption of home loan obligations, the release of borrowers, and the substitution of new parties at escalated interest rates resulted in new contracts, notwithstanding that the loan modification agreements were not intended to be novations; so the date of the loan assumptions, rather than the original date of the notes, controlled the applicable usury rates. Lindenberg v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 691 F.2d 974 (11th Cir. 1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party must plead and prove interest or usury laws of other state.</b> - When another state's law applies, provision of law applicable must be made to appear. Since courts of this state will not take cognizance of interest or usury laws of another state it is essential that the defendant, if the defendant wishes to avail oneself of defense of usury, plead and prove laws of other state in this respect, and that such laws were in force at time of execution of note.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Definition of liquidated debt.-</b> - Liquidation is an amount certain and fixed, either by act and agreement of parties, or by operation of law; a sum which cannot be changed by proof; it is so much or nothing; and the term does not necessarily refer to a writing. Nisbet v. Lawson, 1 Ga. 275 (1846); Council v. Hixon, 11 Ga. App. 818, 76 S.E. 603 (1912). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Liquidated damages were damages that were in an amount that were certain and fixed, and since the trial court did not have before the court such evidence, the court erred in determining that the damages in the contract between the services provider and the corporation were liquidated, and entering a corresponding judgment. Mitchell v. Gilwil Group, Inc., 261 Ga. App. 882, 583 S.E.2d 911 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Trial court properly found that the liquidated damages provision of a contract was enforceable since the plaintiff 's damages would be difficult to assess with accuracy, the parties' intent was to provide for damages rather than a penalty, and the amount specified was a reasonable pre-estimation of the plaintiff 's probable loss. Maz Medics, Inc. v. Satellite Adv. Sys., 194 Ga. App. 583, 391 S.E.2d 446 (1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Service provider was entitled to recover prejudgment interest on the liquidated damages amounts under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-15 because the liquidated damages were "fixed and certain" "by agreement" as provided in the statute.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dispute as to amount of surplus from real estate foreclosure sale.</b> - When the amount of the surplus (if any) from a foreclosure sale on real estate was in dispute throughout the course of litigation (that is, it was the subject of conflicting testimony, which might be resolved only by a final court decision), this surplus figure clearly did not fall within the concept of "liquidation" under Georgia law.

<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's fees.</b> - Trial court's grant of a default judgment to the appellee on the issue of the appellant's liability on a promissory note was upheld but the trial court's award of damages, interest, and attorney fees to the appellee was vacated because material conflicts in the pleadings existed that had to be resolved before the trial court could calculate the value of the stock on the day the appellee submitted the June Conversion Notice and could award that amount as damages.

Whether the sellers were entitled to prejudgment interest on O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-15 (liquidated demands) was a question for the trial court on remand. Estate of Callaway v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that defendant claimed a credit against undisputed specific amount</b> that the plaintiff claimed the plaintiff was fully owed under the executed contract would not render the plaintiff's claim unliquidated.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prejudgment interest.</b> - When a claim was undisputed, the defendant was entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of seven percent per annum from the date the debt became due and the trial court's judgment of prejudgment interest of 18% per annum was in excess of the statutorily required amount. Turner Constr. Co. v. Electrical Distribs., Inc., 202 Ga. App. 726, 415 S.E.2d 325 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because there was no dispute about the specific amount that a realty firm was entitled to receive from the firm's owner if the firm earned the full commission set forth in the operative contracts, that amount was liquidated, and the fact that the owner offered to pay only one-half of that amount did not render the realty firm's claim unliquidated; hence, the realty firm was entitled to prejudgment interest on the unpaid commission from the date of closing. Tommy McBride Realty v. Nicholson, 286 Ga. App. 135, 648 S.E.2d 468 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred when the court concluded upon default that only liquidated damages were involved and awarded a manufacturer damages without an evidentiary hearing in the manufacturer's breach of contract action against a distributor because the complaint did not contain sufficient information to allow the trial court to ascertain the amount owed under the contract and that the amount was fixed and certain; the trial court could not properly award damages and pre-judgment interest under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-15 to the manufacturer without an evidentiary hearing because the manufacturer's complaint did not show that the manufacturer's claims were for liquidated damages.

<p class="p4">Plaintiff's claim for statutory interest was improperly denied as sovereign immunity did not bar the plaintiff's breach of contract claim against the Georgia Lottery Corporation and, thus, it did not bar the award of prejudgment interest in the plaintiff's breach of contract action; however, whether the plaintiff made a sufficient demand for prejudgment interest and was otherwise entitled to recover interest were questions to be resolved on remand. Patel v. Ga. Lottery Corp., 350 Ga. App. 883, 830 S.E.2d 393 (2019). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the plaintiff sued the Georgia Lottery Corporation for breach of contract after the Corporation denied the plaintiff's claim for a $5,000,000 lottery prize, because the amount due on the lottery ticket was fixed, the damages sought were liquidated, and O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-15 was applicable to the award of prejudgment interest; however, whether the plaintiff made a sufficient demand for prejudgment interest and was otherwise entitled to recover interest were questions to be resolved on remand. Patel v. Ga. Lottery Corp., 350 Ga. App. 883, 830 S.E.2d 393 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Policy not liquidated demand until amount of loss and liability established.</b> - Fire insurance policies which insure against all direct loss or damage by fire to an amount not exceeding named sums are not themselves liquidated demands, nor is there originally any amount ascertained payable under those policies.

<p class="p4">Because account invoices sued upon by two contractors represented obligations for the payment of money arising out of transactions to furnish labor and materials, none of which involved a retail installment transaction, and involved liquidated claims, the trial court did not err in determining that those accounts were commercial accounts. Thus, an award of prejudgment interest as to the amounts owed was upheld on appeal. Hampshire Homes, Inc. v. Espinosa Constr. Servs., 288 Ga. App. 718, 655 S.E.2d 316 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellate court properly dismissed an attorney's direct appeal in a case wherein the attorney sued a client for attorney fees as the judgment the attorney recovered was one for damages in an amount under $10,000, and as such, it was subject to appeal as a matter of discretion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 5-6-35(a)(6), rather than of right. The failure of the attorney to recover on the claims of prejudgment interest or attorney fees did not transform the judgment into a finding on liability adverse to the attorney so as to render an appeal of the matter outside the ambit of <span class="s2">§</span> 5-6-35(a)(6).

<p class="p4"><b>Statement.</b> - Farm supplies supplied to a farmer in the farmer's business is clearly a commercial account. The owner of a commercial account can charge interest on that portion of the commercial account which had been due and payable for 30 days or more at a rate not in excess of 1-1/2% per month calculated on the amount owed from the date upon which the amount became due and payable until paid and that a commercial account is classified or defined as an obligation for the payment of money arising out of a transaction to sell or furnish, or the sale of, or furnishing of goods and services other than a retail installment.

<p class="p4">Subcontractor was entitled to recover from an insurer on a payment bond because a pay-when-paid clause in a contract of the contractor and subcontractor could not be used as a defense by the insurer when the insurer denied the subcontractor a federal remedy under the Miller Act.

<p class="p4"><b>Action by subcontractor's supplier against general contractor.</b> - When the sums owed to the subcontractor's supplier arose out of the furnishing of goods to the subcontractor on the project, not out of the furnishing of goods by the supplier to the general contractor, the supplier's action against the general contractor and the surety on the lien bond was not based on a commercial account with the subcontractor but on the supplier's rights under the lien bond - that is, the supplier's rights as a lien claimant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Accordingly, the general contractor's liability did not arise out of failure to pay the amounts owed to the supplier on a commercial account, and O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-16 thus was not applicable.

<p class="p4"><b>Contractor's claim against owner.</b> - Although a jury did not ultimately award the entire amount of a contractor's original claim against an owner, the amount of the unpaid balance as determined by the jury was a due and payable liquidated debt on a commercial account, and therefore subject to prejudgment interest under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-16.

<p class="p4"><b>Retail installment contract for purchase of automobile.</b> - After the plaintiff filed a verified complaint, the trial court erred in granting the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's unverified answer and for judgment on the pleadings as the retail installment contract for the purchase of an automobile was not the type of contract that was the appropriate subject matter for a suit on an open account, and the defendant was not required to verify the defendant's responsive pleadings because retail installment transactions were expressly excluded from the definition of a commercial account; and the contract provided a number of remedies to the plaintiff in the event of non-payment by the defendant that deviated from the traditional understanding of what constituted an open account.

<p class="p4"><b>Application of rule that change in law will not change transaction's usurious nature.</b> - Rule that change in the law will not change the usurious character of a transaction applies only to renewals of an originally usurious transaction, and is not applicable when separate purchases are made on an open account, resulting in an entirely new indebtedness.

<p class="p4"><b>Claim not barred.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of a debtor on all of the invoices that made up a creditor's claim against the debtor on the ground that the complaint was barred by the four-year limitation period for a suit on account because the trial court's grant of summary judgment was based on a purported admission by the creditor that its claims accrued on April 3, 2001, but the trial court misread the document, and the creditor submitted authenticated invoices, which showed dates more recent than four years prior to the date suit was filed; unless otherwise provided in the agreement, claims are barred if the claims are asserted more than four years after invoices are submitted to the buyer.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p13">When a payment is made upon any debt, it shall be applied first to the discharge of any interest due at the time, and the balance, if any, shall be applied to the reduction of the principal. If the payment does not extinguish the interest then due, no interest shall be calculated on such balance of interest and interest shall be calculated only on the principal amount up to the time of the next payment.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prepayments applied first to interest due, absent contrary agreement.</b> - In absence of agreement to contrary, prepayments on a loan must first be applied to interest due and owing at time they are made and then to principal. First Nat'l Bank v. Appalachian Indus., Inc., 146 Ga. App. 630, 247 S.E.2d 422 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section does not prohibit creditor from applying payment upon principal.</b> - Since former Code 1910, <span class="s2">§</span> 3433 was for the benefit of creditor, it did not seem that the debtor could be heard to complain on account of interest-bearing principal having been reduced, with a consequent reduction to the debtor of the indebtedness, by application of the entire payment to principal instead of first extinguishing accrued interest. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co. v. Friedlander Bros., 30 Ga. App. 312, 117 S.E. 762 (1923), aff 'd, 158 Ga. 303, 122 S.E. 890 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creditor may apply payment made before interest is due to reduction of principal.</b> - When payment was made by the debtor, before interest was due on principal of debt, and the debtor did not direct that payment be applied to any particular claim, the creditor had the right to apply the payment to reduction of the principal of the debt. Massell Realty Co. v. Chamberlin, 47 Ga. App. 718, 171 S.E. 311 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In the case of a demand note,</b> no time for payment is expressed; therefore, no interest would be due until payment is demanded. Unless the debtor has stipulated otherwise, the creditor has the right to apply any payments to the reduction of the principal of the debt when no interest was due at the time of payment. Spillers v. First S. Bank, 185 Ga. App. 580, 365 S.E.2d 151 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to recover interest after payment of principal.</b> - It is the general rule that the right to recover interest after payment of principal sum due depends upon whether interest is due by terms of the contract, or whether it is merely an implied incident to the debt and is allowed by way of damages. If it is due by terms of the contract, payment of principal is no bar to a subsequent recovery of interest, but if it is not due by such terms, payment of principal sum is generally a bar to recovery, except that when the obligation is one which by statute bears interest, this is taken as an equivalent contractual obligation to pay interest, and in such a case payment of entire principal does not defeat subsequent recovery of accrued interest. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co. v. Friedlander Bros., 30 Ga. App. 312, 117 S.E. 762 (1923), aff 'd, 158 Ga. 303, 122 S.E. 890 (1924). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">County's payment to landowners who were awarded $ 16.5 million in a condemnation action was not sufficient to pay principal and interest on the judgment the landowners obtained, and the appellate court held that the landowners were entitled to collect post-judgment interest on the amount which the county still owed.

<p class="p4"><b>Borrower waived and released the borrower's claim.</b> - Borrower's breach of contract claim against a lender based on a violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-17, forbidding the calculation of interest upon interest, was barred because the lender had executed loan modification agreements in which the borrower waived and released any claims the borrower had against the lender.

<p class="p4"><b>Payment of attorneys fees.</b> - There is no statutory requirement that credit for proceeds must be applied to attorney fees first.

App. 843, 303 S.E.2d 29 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Attorney was authorized by statute to charge interest at the rate charged and to apply the client's payments first to the interest due and then to the principal. At all times, the client could have avoided any obligation to pay interest by paying the principal in full each month as the client agreed to do. Cooney v. Rowland, 240 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Res judicata.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a lender's motion for summary judgment because the doctrine of res judicata barred a debtor's suit alleging that the lender incorrectly charged interest on the debtor's unsecured revolving line of credit; the same matters were already litigated between the same parties in an action previously adjudicated on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of chapter.</b> - Line of credit arrangement accessed through special drafts drawn on the lender which the borrower may make payable to a third party is clearly governed by the Lender Credit Card Act. The drafts are "lender credit cards" within the meaning of former <span class="s2">§</span> 7-5-3(2) since the drafts constitute "credit confirmation or identification." 1985 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 85-32 (decided under former <span class="s2">§</span> 7-5-2). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the financial institution issues special drafts which the borrower may make payable only to the issuing financial institution and to draw on the line of credit, the borrower must either come back to the financial institution and cash one of the drafts or deposit the draft into the borrower's checking account at the financial institution and then use the borrower's personal check drawn on the borrower's deposit account, the third party would have no reason to know that a credit transaction was transpiring. Thus, lacking the requisite "credit confirmation or identification," it would not be governed by the Lender Credit Card Act, but, rather, would be governed by Georgia's usury provisions found at O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">§</span> 7-4-1. 1985 Op.

<p class="p4">When the drawee bank extends a line of credit to the customer against which the customer may draw by writing checks that would otherwise overdraw the drawee's checking account, because the customer's checks do not indicate the customer has overdraft protection nor is the customer given any article which the customer could present to a third party to give notification of overdraft protection, this arrangement would be governed by Georgia's general usury provisions rather than the Lender Credit Card Act. 1985 Op.

A late payment charge may not be imposed more than once with respect to a particular late payment. If a late payment charge is deducted from a payment made on the home loan and such deduction results in a subsequent default on a subsequent payment, no late payment charge may be imposed for such default.

Flipping a home loan is the consummating of a high-cost home loan to a borrower that refinances an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior five years when the new loan does not provide reasonable, tangible net benefit to the borrower considering all of the circumstances including, but not limited to, the terms of both the new and refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan, and the borrower's circumstances. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p13">High-cost home loans shall be subject to the following limitations and prohibited practices:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p13">(1) No prepayment fees or penalties shall be provided for in the loan documents for a high-cost home loan or charged the borrower after the last day of the twenty-fourth month following the loan closing or which exceed in the aggregate: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(A) In the first 12 months after the loan closing, more than 2 percent of the loan amount prepaid; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(B) In the second 12 months after the loan closing, more than 1 percent of the amount prepaid; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(2) A high-cost home loan shall not contain a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments. This provision does not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the borrower; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(3) A high-cost home loan shall not include payment terms under which the outstanding principal balance will increase at any time over the course of the loan because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount of interest due; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(4) A high-cost home loan shall not contain a provision that increases the interest rate after default. This provision does not apply to interest rate changes in a variable rate loan otherwise consistent with the provisions of the loan documents, provided that the change in the interest rate is not triggered by the event of default or the acceleration of the indebtedness; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(5) A high-cost home loan shall not include terms under which more than two periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to the borrower; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(6) Without regard to whether a borrower is acting individually or on behalf of others similarly situated, any provision of a high-cost home loan agreement that allows a party to require a borrower to assert any claim or defense in a forum that is less convenient, more costly, or more dilatory for the resolution of a dispute than a judicial forum established in this state where the borrower may otherwise properly bring the claim or defense or limits in any way any claim or defense the borrower may have is unconscionable and void; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(7) A creditor shall not make a high-cost home loan without first receiving certification from a counselor with a third-party nonprofit organization approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Georgia Housing and Finance Authority that the borrower has received counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction. No creditor, servicer, or its institution shall be required to contribute to the funding of any nonprofit organization that provides counseling required pursuant to this paragraph; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(8) A creditor shall not make a high-cost home loan unless a reasonable creditor would believe at the time the loan is consummated that the borrower residing in the home will be able to make the scheduled payments associated with the loan based upon a consideration of his or her current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources, other than the borrower's equity in the collateral that secures repayment of the loan. There is a rebuttable presumption that the borrower residing in the home is able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, said borrower's total monthly debts, including amounts under the loan, do not exceed 50 percent of said borrower's monthly gross income as verified by tax returns, payroll receipts, and other third-party income verification; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(9) A creditor or servicer shall not pay a contractor under a home improvement contract from the proceeds of a high-cost home loan unless: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(A) The creditor or servicer is presented with an affidavit of the contractor that the work has been completed, which affidavit meets the requirements of Code Section 44-14-361.2; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(B) The proceeds are disbursed in an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the contractor or, at the election of the borrower, through a third-party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the drafter of the instrument, and the contractor prior to the disbursement; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p13">(11) A creditor who makes a high-cost home loan and who has the legal right to foreclose shall provide notice of the intent to foreclose to the borrower in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the borrower last known to the creditor. Such notice shall be sent to the borrower at least 14 days prior to the publication of the legal advertisement required by Code Section 44-14-162; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(12) If a creditor or servicer asserts that grounds for acceleration of a high-cost home loan exist and requires the payment in full of all sums secured by the security instrument, the borrower or anyone authorized to act on the borrower's behalf shall have the right at any time, up to the time title is transferred by means of foreclosure by judicial proceeding and sale or otherwise, to cure the default and reinstate the high-cost home loan by tendering the total amount of principal, interest, late fees, and escrow deposits in arrears, not including any acceleration. Cure of default as provided in this paragraph shall reinstate the borrower to the same position as if the default had not occurred and shall nullify as of the date of the cure any acceleration of any obligation under the security instrument or note arising from the default; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(13) (A) To cure a default under this Code section, a borrower shall not be required to pay any charge, fee, or penalty attributable to the exercise of the right to cure a default as provided for in this Code section, other than the fees specifically allowed by this Code section. The borrower shall not be liable for any attorneys' fees relating to the borrower's default that are incurred by the creditor or servicer prior to or during the 30 day period set forth in this paragraph, nor for any such fees in excess of $100.00 that are incurred by the creditor or servicer after the expiration of the 30 day period but prior to the time the creditor or servicer files a foreclosure action or takes other action to seize or transfer ownership of the home. After the creditor or servicer files a foreclosure action or takes other action to seize or transfer ownership of the home, the borrower shall only be liable for attorneys' fees that are reasonable and actually incurred by the creditor or servicer based on a reasonable hourly rate and a reasonable number of hours plus any other reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the creditor or servicer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(B) If a default is cured prior to the initiation of any action to foreclose or to seize or transfer a home, the creditor or servicer shall not institute the foreclosure proceeding or other action for that default. If a default is cured after the initiation of any action to foreclose, the creditor or servicer shall take such steps as are necessary to terminate the foreclosure proceeding or other action. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(C) Before any action is filed to foreclose upon the home or other action is taken to seize or transfer ownership of a home, a notice of the right to cure the default must be delivered to the borrower informing the borrower of the following: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(i) The nature of the default claimed on the high-cost home loan and of the borrower's right to cure the default by paying the sum of money required to cure the default. If the amount necessary to cure the default will change during the 30 day period after the effective date of the notice due to the application of a daily interest rate or the addition of late fees as allowed by this chapter, the notice shall give sufficient information to enable the borrower to calculate the amount at any point during the 30 day period; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(ii) The date by which the borrower shall cure the default to avoid acceleration and initiation of foreclosure or other action to seize the home which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is effective and the name and address and phone number of a person to whom the payment or tender shall be made; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(iii) That, if the borrower does not cure the default by the date specified, the creditor or servicer may take steps to terminate the borrower's ownership in the property by commencing a foreclosure proceeding or other action to seize the home; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(iv) The name and address of the creditor or servicer and the telephone number of a representative of the creditor or servicer whom the borrower may contact if the borrower disagrees with the creditor's or servicer's assertion that a default has occurred or the correctness of the creditor's or servicer's calculation of the amount required to cure the default; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(14) A high-cost home loan shall not contain nor shall a creditor or servicer enforce a provision that permits a creditor or servicer, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness. This paragraph does not prohibit acceleration of the loan in good faith due to the borrower's failure to abide by the material terms of the loan; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13">(15) All high-cost home loan documents that create a debt or pledge property as collateral shall contain the following notice on the first page in a conspicuous manner: "Notice: This is a mortgage subject to special rules under the 'Georgia Fair Lending Act.' Purchasers or assignees of this mortgage may be liable for all claims and defenses by the borrower with respect to the mortgage."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
