</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Extent of power conferred.</b> - County, it is true, is a corporation. But this is only for certain specific purposes. Counties are, in fact, but quasi corporations, and this section of the Code is not to be understood as conferring any powers, except the right to sue and be sued, since the other powers are all conferred and regulated by other statutes and provisions of the Code. Millwood v. DeKalb County, 106 Ga. 743, 32 S.E. 577 (1899). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">County is a body corporate and may sue and be sued, but the county's functions are government, and it has no power except as conferred by statute. Town of Decatur v. DeKalb County, 130 Ga. 483, 61 S.E. 23 (1908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This section subjects the counties of this state to suit, but not to suits upon all causes of action. It does not make them generally liable to suits like individuals or as municipal corporations. Being political subdivisions of the state, they cannot be sued unless made subject to suit expressly or by necessary implication. Decatur County v. Praytor, Howton &amp; Wood Contracting Co., 163 Ga. 929, 137 S.E. 247 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Who may sue.</b> - Right to sue a county is not restricted to citizens of this state. Board of Comm'rs v. Hurd, 49 Ga. 462 (1873).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction with Code </b>Section 36-1-4. - Former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 383 and 384 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 36-1-3 and 36-1-4) must be construed together, and those statutes must receive a reasonable construction.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>County's violation of constitutional right raises cause of action.</b> - Violation by a county of a constitutional right of the citizen must, by necessary implication, raise a cause of action in favor of the citizen against the county, unless some means of redress other than suit has been afforded by the legislature. Tounsel v. State Hwy. Dep't, 180 Ga. 112, 178 S.E. 285 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability of sovereign immunity in action between city and county.</b> - In a suit by a city against a county, seeking a portion of tax revenue raised by the county from alcoholic beverage sales, there was a threshold question of whether sovereign immunity applied in suits between political subdivisions of the same sovereign (such as the city and the county), which the trial court had not addressed; therefore, remand was required.

<p class="p6"><b>Power to employ counsel.</b> - County commissioners are authorized by clear implication to employ counsel for the county. Templeman v. Jeffries, 172 Ga. 895, 159 S.E. 248 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Action by county for enforcement not authorized.</b> - County did not have authority to pursue tort damages based on the county's complaint alleging that unlawful acts by the defendants, including "occupation of buildings without obtaining inspections or certificates of occupancy, zoning violations, building code, safety, and fire violations, operation of businesses in a residential zone, and the like," caused the county to spend money enforcing the county's laws and protecting the county's citizens. Torres v. Putnam County, 246 Ga. App. 544, 541 S.E.2d 133 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Tort claims by county not authorized.</b> - When a county had recovered, identified, and properly disposed of bodies found at a crematorium, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-3 did not authorize the county to recover the county's costs of doing so as compensatory damages in a tort action against the crematorium, funeral homes, and funeral directors alleging negligence and public nuisance claims.

Haber v. Fulton County, 124 Ga. App. 789, 186 S.E.2d 152 (1971), overruled on other grounds, Cox v. Cox ex rel. State Dep't of Human Resources, 255 Ga. 6, 334 S.E.2d 683 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sovereign immunity recognized since common law.</b> - Doctrine of sovereign immunity has been recognized in this state since the adoption of the common law. Hendon v. DeKalb County, 203 Ga. App. 750, 417 S.E.2d 705, cert. denied, 203 Ga. App. 906, 417 S.E.2d 705 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability of sovereign immunity in suit between county and city.</b> - In a suit by a city against a county, seeking a portion of tax revenue raised by the county from alcoholic beverage sales, there was a threshold question of whether sovereign immunity applied in suits between political subdivisions of the same sovereign (such as the city and the county), which the trial court had not addressed; therefore, remand was required. Clayton County v. City of College Park, 301 Ga. 653, 803 S.E.2d 63 (2017). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In a case involving taxation of alcoholic beverages, the city's claims against the county were not barred by sovereign immunity since the city and county were merely exercising their own respective home rule powers by collecting tax revenues for their own purposes, and neither was acting on behalf of the State of Georgia; thus, there was no sovereignty to be maintained. City of College Park v. Clayton County, 306 Ga. 301, 830 S.E.2d 179 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Immunity statutory, not common law.</b> - Unlike the immunity of the state which had been judicially created, the immunity of a county from suit is found in statutory law. Nelson v. Spalding County, 249 Ga. 334, 290 S.E.2d 915 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Even if Ga. Const. 1976, Art. VI, Sec. V, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Para. IX) were not meant to reserve immunity for counties in all cases, such immunity has the additional support of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-4. Nelson v. Spalding County, 249 Ga. 334, 290 S.E.2d 915 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Extent of immunity.</b> - Sovereign immunity enjoyed by a county extends to discretionary as well as ministerial functions and, indeed, even to personal injury claims based on nuisance. Early County v. Fincher, 184 Ga. App. 47, 360 S.E.2d 602, cert. denied, 184 Ga. App. 909, 360 S.E.2d 602 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Sovereign immunity barred the plaintiff's claims against the defendant county because, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-4, a county was not liable to suit for any cause of action unless made so by statute, and the county's sovereign immunity had not been waived with respect to the claims asserted by the plaintiff.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Language of section broad and comprehensive.</b> - Language could not be broader or more comprehensive, or more free from doubt, than the words of this section. When it says the county shall not be liable for any cause of action, the statute expressly negatives the idea of exceptions other than provided therein, to wit, "unless made so by statute." Wood v. Floyd County, 161 Ga. 743, 131 S.E. 882 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>General rule for liability.</b> - Whenever a county is by statute made liable for a given demand, an action against the county will lie therefor, though the statute does not in express terms authorize or provide for the bringing of such an action. Decatur County v. Praytor, Howton &amp; Wood Contracting Co., 163 Ga. 929, 137 S.E. 247 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Negligence not sufficient for action against county.</b> - Neither negligent performance of duties which the county authorities are compelled to perform, nor the negligent discharge of duties voluntarily assumed, except in cases provided by statute, gives a cause of action against the county. Millwood v. DeKalb County, 106 Ga. 743, 32 S.E. 577 (1899); Mitchell County v. Dixon, 20 Ga. App. 21, 92 S.E. 405 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>County exempt from suit generally.</b> - This section has the effect of exempting a county from liability to suit in the absence of a statute authorizing a suit for the breach of duty alleged, though that duty is one imposed on the county by statute. Wolf v. Upson County, 44 F.2d 925 (5th Cir. 1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Medical care for inmates.</b> - Trial court correctly determined that the state law claims made against a county and against a sheriff and medical contract compliance administrator in their official capacities were barred because, although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2(a) imposed upon the county the duty and cost of medical care for inmates in the county's custody, the statute did not waive sovereign immunity of the county or the county's agents or employees.

<p class="p6"><b>Rule for county liability different from that of city.</b> - While it was true that the liability of cities on the cities' contracts was determined just as it was at common law and under former Code 1933,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 69-301 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1) and their liability as to torts conforms to the rule at common law, the rule of liability as to counties was different, in that former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1502 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-4) relaxed the rule which forbid altogether any suit against a county for any cause of action so as to authorize suits against the city when so authorized by express constitutional or statutory authority. Purser v. Dodge County, 188 Ga. 250, 3 S.E.2d 574, answer conformed to, 60 Ga. App. 316, 3 S.E.2d 744 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Waiver of immunity.</b> - Immunity provided to a county by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-4 is waived, pursuant to Ga. Const., 1983, Art. I, Sec. VI, Para. IX, when the county purchases a liability insurance policy. Early County v. Fincher, 184 Ga. App. 47, 360 S.E.2d 602, cert. denied, 184 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No constitutional or statutory authority for recovery of punitive damages.</b> - Since damages recoverable in an action by a property owner whose property is harmed by a county for public purposes is a substitute for damages recoverable in a condemnation action, there is no constitutional or statutory authority for the recovery of punitive damages against a county. Fulton County v. Baranan, 240 Ga. 837, 242 S.E.2d 617 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>When county officials exceed powers.</b> - When public officers, in discharging duties imposed upon the officers by law, undertake other duties not imposed by law, although intending it to be a benefit to the public, the latter, as represented by county governments, cannot be made responsible for torts or ultra vires contracts.

<p class="p6"><b>Acts done within scope of authority and without wilfulness, fraud, or malice.</b> - Under sovereign immunity principles, a public officer or employee, acting within the scope of their authority and engaged in discretionary as opposed to ministerial functions, is entitled to immunity from suit provided the acts complained of are done within the scope of the officer's authority and without wilfulness, fraud, malice, or corruption. Hendon v. DeKalb County, 203 Ga. App. 750, 417 S.E.2d 705, cert. denied, 203 Ga. App. 906, 417 S.E.2d 705 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Board of education liable for acts outside board's authority.</b> - County is a public corporation and acts through the county's officers and agents. In matters pertaining to education, the county acts through the county's board of education. When the board of education acts upon matters lawfully within the board's jurisdiction, the board is the county acting through the board's corporate authority, and a county is not liable to suit for any cause of action unless made so by statute. But when the board of education, through the board's members, acts beyond the scope of the board's lawful jurisdiction and commits an actionable wrong, the act so committed is not "county action," and in such a case a suit may be maintained in the courts of this state against the wrongdoers.

<p class="p6"><b>Taking private property.</b> - As a general rule, a county is not liable to suit unless there is a law which so declares. Yet the appropriate law can be found in the Constitution.

<p class="p9"><b>1. Liability Generally</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No liability for torts generally.</b> - Rule of general nonliability for torts is true whether the alleged cause of action arises from the negligent performance of duties which the county authorities are compelled to perform, or a negligent discharge of duties voluntarily assumed in the exercise of a discretion vested in the authorities by law.

<p class="p6">County, when exercising governmental functions and acting as an agency of the state is not liable, in the absence of statutes imposing liability, for the county's failure to perform a duty or for the county's negligent performance of the duty, not even when the duty is imposed by statute; and there is no distinction in the application of this rule between the neglect to perform an act which ought to have been performed, and the performance of the duty in a negligent manner.

<p class="p6">County is liable to suit by contractors for breach of a valid and binding contract for the building of a bridge over a river in such county, upon the assumption that the difference between the representations in the plans and specifications as to the facts and conditions under the bed of the river, and the actual facts and conditions thereof, amounted to a breach of the contract by the county. Decatur County v. Praytor, Howton &amp; Wood Contracting Co., 163 Ga. 929, 137 S.E. 247 (1927). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Suit may be maintained against a county and a verdict and judgment obtained against the county for damages resulting from a defect in a bridge, although it may appear that jurisdiction over the highway on which the bridge was located had been assumed by the State Highway Department (now Department of Transportation) under the terms of the law, and that the State Highway Department and not the county was guilty of negligence in the maintenance and construction of the bridge or its approaches which caused the injury. Berrien County v. Vickers, 73 Ga. App. 863, 38 S.E.2d 619 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 95-1001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>For a county to be liable for injuries resulting from defective bridge repairs</b> there must have been a failure to take a bond from a contractor when such a bond was required, and the injury complained of must have occurred within the time which would have been covered by the contractor's bond, if such a bond had been given.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Generally, counties have broader immunity from suits than municipalities.</b> 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-32.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No liability for acts of probationer.</b> - County's potential liability for acts of a probationer working on a community service project depends upon the existence of a statute authorizing a tort action against the county. 1975 Op.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No liability for collision with roadside object.</b> - Generally, a county will not be subject to liability for damages resulting from a motorist's collision with a garbage container placed by the county beside the county's road. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U74-66.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Liability for misfeasance.</b> - Slash Pine Area Planning and Development Commission is not liable for damage to private individuals resulting from improper performance or nonperformance of duties of the Commission's officers, agents, or servants. 1967 Op.

<p class="p6">.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No tort liability generally.</b> - Local school district is not liable in tort under the law of Georgia for injuries sustained by a pupil engaged in school athletic activities. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 100. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Neither a county board of education nor the board's members, by virtue of their membership, are liable for injuries incurred by a pupil riding on one of the board's school buses. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-84.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Board of education liable if acting beyond scope of authority.</b> - When the board of education acts upon matters lawfully within the board's jurisdiction, it is the county acting through the county's corporate authority, and the county is not liable to suit for any cause of action unless made so by statute; but when the board of education, through the board's members, acts beyond the scope of the board's lawful jurisdiction and commits an actionable wrong, the act so committed is not "county action," and in such a case a suit may be maintained in the courts of this state against the wrongdoers. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 98. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">County board of education, acting beyond the scope of the board's lawful jurisdiction in leasing school buildings to private citizens to be used as a recreational center, might thereby subject the board's members to individual liability to suit in case someone was hurt or an accident happened on this property. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 98.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No shield from liability for individual negligence.</b> - This shield from liability, which is generally referred to as the doctrine of "sovereign immunity" is applicable only if the act or conduct causing the loss is one which was taken by the board within the scope of the board's authority or official discretion; it does not protect a board member when it is such member's own personal and individual negligence which causes the injury rather than an action of the school board; another exception is the fact that while the doctrine protects the school board and the members of the board from liability when the injury results from ordinary negligence of the board, it would not apply when the action of the board amounts to malicious, willful, or wanton misconduct. 1965-66 Op.

<p class="p6"><b>Section does not impair power of grand jury.</b> - Sections 416, 417, and 418 of former Civil Code 1910 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-10) were not intended to and do not take away from the grand jury the grand jury's power to investigate, inspect, and examine the books and records of county officers, or, where the officers deem it necessary, to appoint one or more citizens of the county to do so, as prescribed by former Penal Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 840 and 841. McLarty v. Fulton County, 52 Ga. App. 445, 183 S.E. 646 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability of section to county having city of over 85,000.</b> - Section 841 of Penal Code 1910 (see <span class="s1">§</span> 15-12-76 [repealed]) is valid and applies to counties having a city of more than 85,000, except that it does not authorize the appointment of expert accountants by the county commissioners or ordinary (now judge of the probate court), as the case may be, to examine the books and accounts of county officers, as by virtue of former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 416 through 418 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-10). In such counties the clerk of the county commissioners is ex officio auditor and the clerk is required to make such examination whenever called on by the county commissioners. McLarty v. Fulton County, 52 Ga. App. 445, 183 S.E. 646 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Officer employed under section a public officer.</b> - When a statute by implication authorizes the county commissioners to appoint an officer in and for a county, the action of the commissioners in so doing is done by the commissioners as an agency of the state. The relation between the county and the county attorney does not rest upon contract, but arises from appointment authorized by a legislative enactment. An individual who has a designation or title given the individual by law, and who exercises functions concerning the public assigned to the individual by law, is a public officer. Stelling v. Richmond County, 81 Ga. App. 571, 59 S.E.2d 414 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Residency requirement.</b> - In the case of a county auditor, the residency requirement of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 89-101(7) (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-6-59) was dispensed with by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1301 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-10). However, the requirement that a county officer, whether elected or appointed, be a qualified voter remained absolute. Lester Witte &amp; Co. v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Inapplicable to system created by General Assembly.</b> - Because a county tax commissioner's employees were within the county's civil service system, the county was properly granted summary judgment as to that issue, and hence, the county's personnel director was authorized to refuse to implement raises to the employees as the commissioner sought; moreover, the commissioner's reliance on O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-21 did not change the result, as that statute expressly applied only to civil service systems created by county governing authorities, and the civil service system at issue was created by the Georgia General Assembly.

<p class="p6">Interim appointed sheriff's attempt, by letter to the county clerk, to have the sheriff's employees covered by the provisions of a civil service ordinance was invalid, since the county had not enacted a second ordinance or resolution pursuant to subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-21 providing that employees of elected officials could be made subject to the civil service system by written application of the elected official.

<p class="p6">Since the county created a personnel system applicable to the sheriff's department, a newly elected sheriff's termination of current employees without affording the employees due process rights in connection with the employees' dismissal and the sheriff's hiring of employees to replace the dismissed employees was improper.

<p class="p6">Since it was not clearly established at the time in question that a sheriff was bound by a county merit system and that employees of the sheriff had a property interest in the employees' jobs, the sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity from the employees' claim of wrongful termination from the employee's jobs.

<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">Whenever it is necessary and expedient to lay out a new militia district, to change the lines of old districts, or to consolidate or abolish old districts, the judge of the probate court may, at any time, appoint three commissioners who are citizens of the district or districts from which it is proposed to make the new district or to change the lines thereof, whose duty it shall be to lay out and define the lines and to report the same to the judge of the probate court. The commissioners shall have authority to engage the services of a competent surveyor to assist them in their duties. The surveyor shall be paid for his services, out of the county treasury, the same compensation county surveyors are paid for similar services rendered to a citizen. If the judge of the probate court approves the report of the commissioners, he shall have all proceedings in the matter entered on his minutes, after which the district laid out or the line changed or defined shall be known and regarded accordingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">Commissioners appointed by the ordinaries to lay out new militia districts, or change the lines of those existing, have authority to engage the services of a competent surveyor to assist the commissioners in the commissioners' duties. The commissioners are not limited to the county surveyor. Graham v. Hall, 68 Ga. 354 (1882).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Ordinary (now judge of the probate court) determines expediency.</b> - Commissioners are mere agents to lay off the lines of a new district; the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) determines the expediency of creating it. The creation of a new district is not, therefore, illegal because deemed inexpedient by the commissioners. Conley v. Poole, 67 Ga. 254 (1881).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Finality of decision.</b> - Judge of a superior court has no jurisdiction to review by certiorari the action of an ordinary (now judge of the probate court) or board of commissioners for there is no decision of a judicial question between parties litigant. Hillsman v. Harris, 84 Ga. 432, 11 S.E. 400 (1890); Hudson v. Sullivan, 93 Ga. 631, 20 S.E. 77 (1894).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>New district must not leave old district undermanned.</b> - An order, by the proper county authority, approving a report of the commissioners appointed to lay out and establish a new militia district, is void since, by the establishment of the new district, an existing district is left with less than the required number of persons liable to militia duty.

<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 391 et seq. (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-4-1 et seq.) did not fall because of conflict with the Constitution as to the number of votes required to remove or change the county site. The sole purpose of these sections was to provide machinery to carry out the constitutional provision relative to a change of county sites by providing an election by striking out the requirements as to the number of votes, which was already fixed by the Constitution; these sections remain complete in themselves and capable of being carried out in accordance with the legislative intent. Lee v. Tucker, 130 Ga. 43, 60 S.E. 164 (1908) (decided prior to revision of section by Ga. L. 1911, p. 54, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>General Assembly not bound by findings of Secretary of State.</b> - General Assembly, in determining the facts and legislating upon the removal of county sites under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 486 et seq. (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-4-1 et seq.), is not bound by the findings of the Secretary of State as to the result of the election. Bachlott v. Buie, 158 Ga. 705, 124 S.E. 339 (1924); Cowart v. Manry, 166 Ga. 612, 144 S.E. 21 (1928).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure of General Assembly to legislate.</b> - When the removal election was held on May 5, 1927, and the General Assembly of 1927 did not pass any legislation thereon, the General Assembly of 1929 had the constitutional power and authority to pass an Act removing the county site. Cowart v. Manry, 166 Ga. 612, 144 S.E. 21 (1928).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Act for removal of county seat does not impair obligation of contract.</b> - Act for the removal of the county seat does not impair the obligation of contract. In such matters one legislature had not the right to bind all subsequent legislatures. Hamrick v. Rouse, 17 Ga. 56 (1855).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Duty of ordinary (now judge of the probate court).</b> - Under the provisions of this section, the power to call an election to determine whether in a given county there shall be a change of the location of the county site is vested in the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) and even if the General Assembly had power in a given case to so change this general law as to vest this power in another official, the Act approved December 8, 1886, creating a Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues for the County of DeKalb, neither vested nor sought to vest such power in the board of commissioners created by it. Wells v. Ragsdale, 102 Ga. 53, 29 S.E. 165 (1897). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">If, in order to find that the petition contains the requisite two-fifths, it is necessary for the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) to act upon extraneous evidence, explaining that names on the petition and the digest list, though different, in fact refer to the same persons, and that certain names on the digest list are of deceased persons and persons removed from the county, then there is no absolute duty to call the election. After refusal by the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) mandamus will not lie to compel the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) to act. Barrett v. Ashmore, 137 Ga. 545, 73 S.E. 825 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Order shall not specify particular place of removal.</b> - Petition for the election should be for an election for the removal of the county site, and the order calling the election should show that it is one for the removal of the actual county site, without specifying a particular place to which it shall be removed, so as to leave to the qualified voters free choice between the place where the county site is actually located and any other place in the county. Cheney v. Ragan, 151 Ga. 735, 108 S.E. 30 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Provision as to five-year period not binding on subsequent legislature.</b> - Provision relating to the removal of a county seat not oftener than once every five years is not binding on a subsequent legislature and a subsequent legislature would be authorized under the Constitution to pass an Act removing a county site, although the election upon which the Act was based was held within less than five years from a previous election held for that purpose. Orr v. James, 159 Ga. 237, 125 S.E. 468 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Calling election prima-facie proof of proper petition.</b> - Calling of the election by the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) determined at least prima facie that the petitioners were of the class and were of a sufficient number as required by the statute for the purpose of calling an election at which the question of the removal of the county site to a named town within the county should be voted upon. Vornberg v. Dunn, 143 Ga. 111, 84 S.E. 370 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Statement of policy.</b> - This section is an expression of public policy by the lawmaking branch of the state, providing protection to public funds. It takes precedence over the generally recognized public policy in favor of free alienation of private property. Chero-Cola Co. v. May, 169 Ga. 273, 149 S.E. 895 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Scope of lien.</b> - Execution of an official bond creates a lien upon the property of the principal, and the property of the principal's sureties, for the payment of all liability that arises from breach of the bond. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Richmond County, 174 Ga. 599, 163 S.E. 482 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>No lien on property held in trust.</b> - When property is held in trust the property is not subject to an execution issued against trustees as principal and surety on a county treasurer's bond, notwithstanding at the time the bond was executed such trustees were the apparent owners of the land. Hurst v. Commissioners of DeKalb County, 110 Ga. 33, 35 S.E. 294 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Timing.</b> - When effort is made to arrest execution on property because the property is encumbered by a security deed, but it is not alleged that such deed is anterior in date to the bond of the treasurer, such effort will be unavailing.

<p class="p6"><b>Rights of sureties.</b> - In view of a recognition by the personal sureties on a bond of the sureties' continued liability to the secured party under the bond, and of the necessary implication of a final judgment rendered, a court did not err in failing to make an express ruling upon the question of whether or not a purported cancellation entered on the original execution based on that bond was void.

The power given by this Code section and Code Section 36-6-22 to inquire into the affairs of the treasurer of the county and to suspend him from office in certain cases shall in no way affect the liability of the treasurer or that of the sureties on his bond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Authority for sale.</b> - Proper resolution, duly recorded, is the authority by which the county's title for land may be divested by deed. Head v. Lee, 203 Ga. 191, 45 S.E.2d 666 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When order not on minutes.</b> - When county commissioners authorize a conveyance of land brought in by the county at a tax sale, but fail to put the order of authorization on the minutes, as required by this section, it is competent for the commissioners at a subsequent meeting of the board to ratify the deed to the purchaser from the county, and to cause the authorization to be put on the minutes. Braswell v. Palmer, 191 Ga. 262, 11 S.E.2d 889 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Tax sale not authorized.</b> - Fact that a purported sale of county-owned property was by tax sale did not operate to negate or otherwise nullify the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-9-2.

<p class="p6"><b>County commissioner is a public officer occupying a fiduciary relationship</b> requiring the commissioner to exercise the utmost good faith, fidelity, and integrity in dealing with county property as a trustee and servant of the people, which the commissioner may not sell without legislative sanction unless the property's use shall have been abandoned by or become unserviceable to the county. If county property be sold by the commissioner, the commissioner shall obtain the most advantageous price. Timbs v.

<p class="p6"><b>Denial or change of use of property.</b> - County board of commissioners has right to deny use of any public property if the property is used in a wasteful or ineffective manner. Wheeler v. DeKalb County, 249 Ga. 678, 292 S.E.2d 855 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When public property is a building constructed from funds of a designated bond issue for a particular use, the board of commissioners may change the intended use of the building when circumstances which gave rise to the bond issue change so that the building constructed from those funds is no longer needed for that purpose, and the property's continued use for that purpose would be a waste of county resources. Wheeler v. DeKalb County, 249 Ga. 678, 292 S.E.2d 855 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sheriff had power to modify county-owned property within exclusive use.</b> - County sheriff had the independent authority to repaint and remark county-owned sheriff's vehicles assigned to the sheriff's exclusive use, but lacked the authority to modify portions of a county-owned building in which the sheriff's office and jail were housed, as the facility was shared with the superior, state, and magistrate courts of Clayton County, as well as the clerks of those courts, the solicitor general, and the district attorney, and hence, not under the sheriff's exclusive use. As a result, subject to compliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-8-91, summary judgment in favor of the county as to the extent of the sheriff's authority was reversed as to the former, but affirmed as to the latter.

City of Atlanta, 104 Ga. 1, 30 S.E. 500 (1898) (decided prior to revision of section by Ga. L. 1935, p. 110, <span class="s1">§</span> 1.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Lease for ninety-nine years.</b> - Commissioners cannot lease county property in such manner as to put the property out of the power of the county authorities for 99 years to devote the property to the exclusive use of the county. Equity will enjoin use under such a lease. Town of Decatur v. DeKalb County, 130 Ga. 483, 61 S.E. 23 (1908) (decided prior to revision of section by Ga. L. 1935, p. 110, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability to lease.</b> - When a lease of county property ran on a month-to-month basis, giving the lessee only a usufruct with no estate passing out of the county, this section was inapplicable since there was no conveyance of county property. Overlin v. Boyd, 598 F.2d 423 (5th Cir. 1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Nature of duty.</b> - When a local law gives a board of commissioners exclusive jurisdiction in governing and controlling county property, the commissioners have the duty to maintain control over county property, but this duty coexists with the duty to exercise that control in the manner the commissioners deem most beneficial to the county. Smith v. Board of Comm'rs, 244 Ga. 133, 259 S.E.2d 74 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Usufruct of airport.</b> - Contract by a county granting a usufruct of an airport to a private corporation for a period of years is not a disposition of county property requiring the antecedent resolution of county authorities. Southern Airways Co. v. DeKalb County, 102 Ga. App. 850, 118 S.E.2d 234 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Power of commissioners.</b> - Those county officers who by virtue of their office have charge of the county affairs may, by proper order to be entered on their minutes, direct the disposal of and execute good and sufficient title to lands belonging to the county which are not necessary for public use. Head v. Lee, 203 Ga. 191, 45 S.E.2d 666 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Ordinary (now judge of the probate court) had power to lease</b> directly to an individual certain realty for use in operating a filling station as it was then being and had been used for 13 years. Such a lease, having been so executed by the ordinary (now county governing authority) was not void on the ground that the lease was not authorized by law, or that the interest thereby created extended beyond the term of the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) then in office, or that the lease amounted to a commercial transaction in which the county was not authorized by law to engage. Black v. Forsyth County, 193 Ga. 571, 19 S.E.2d 297 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Signature on deed.</b> - If the county commissioners authorize the sale of county land, the deed may lawfully be signed by the chair in the name of the board. Braswell v. Palmer, 191 Ga. 262, 11 S.E.2d 889 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statute of limitation.</b> - As the object of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-9-2 is to give information to the public, the statute of limitation in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-22 was inapplicable because the action arose from a claim that a public officer had failed to perform the officer's official duty. Dade County v. Miami Land Co., 253 Ga. 776, 325 S.E.2d 750 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Discretion of county officers.</b> - Necessities of the various counties in regard to these matters are to be determined by the peculiar conditions surrounding each county; and, therefore, the sound judgment of the county authorities in each case must be relied upon to provide the public with proper buildings on the one hand, and to protect the taxpayer from useless and unnecessary burdens in regard to such matters on the other.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Policy.</b> - This section is designed to keep the public's business open to inspection. Thus, no one can seriously contend that a party has entered into a legal contract with county officers and is entitled to the benefits of a contract, unless there has been a full compliance with the requirements of this section. Graham v. Beacham, 189 Ga. 304, 5 S.E.2d 775 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Purpose.</b> - Purpose and effect of this section was to furnish a defense for the county against the claim of any contractor with the county who might enter into a contract with the county without compliance with the condition imposed by this section. Ward v. State Hwy. Bd., 172 Ga. 414, 157 S.E. 328 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Not applicable to municipality.</b> - Requirement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-10-1 is not applicable to a municipality. City of Powder Springs v. WMM Properties, Inc., 253 Ga. 753, 325 S.E.2d 155 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>For construction of section as against Act creating county public school system.</b> - See County Bd. of Educ. v. Young, 187 Ga. 644, 1 S.E.2d 739 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Oral contracts</b> on behalf of a county have repeatedly been held to be void. City of Warrenton v. Johnson, 235 Ga. 665, 221 S.E.2d 429 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>An oral agreement is unenforceable,</b> even though the agreement is embodied or recited in a resolution adopted by the county commissioners and entered on the minutes. Murray County v. Pickering, 42 Ga. App. 739, 157 S.E. 343 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Subsequent oral modification.</b> - Subsequent modification to a contract with a county may not be oral even though the contract leaves the general purpose and effect of the subject matter of the contract intact. Lester Witte &amp; Co. v. Rabun County, 245 Ga. 382, 265 S.E.2d 4 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Requirement of entry on minutes not satisfied.</b> - Entry on the minutes of a county board of commissioners concerning preparation of supplemental indexes to the public records of the county does not meet the requirement of this section. Fulton County v. Holland, 71 Ga. App. 455, 31 S.E.2d 202 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Attempted delegation of contracting power illegal.</b> - Authorization for a county employee to purchase a dumptruck was an attempted delegation of the authority of the commission which was illegal since only the board would have the authority to make such purchase contract. Floyd v. Thomas, 211 Ga. 656, 87 S.E.2d 846 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Grounds for injunction.</b> - When the petition alleges that the board of commissioners illegally entered into a contract for the purchase of certain automotive equipment by authorizing a county employee to purchase a certain type dumptruck without stating from whom it was to be purchased and at what price, and prays that the defendants be restrained and enjoined from paying for the equipment purchased, it shows a good cause of action for the relief sought, and the court did not err in overruling the general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) thereto.

<p class="p6"><b>Effect of valid contract not entered upon minutes.</b> - County contract, otherwise valid, is not rendered void by not being entered of record by those whose duty it is to record the contract upon their minutes; but it is, through such failure, rendered unenforceable until the contract is recorded, and mandamus will lie to require its record. Malcom v. Fulton County, 209 Ga. 392, 73 S.E.2d 173 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Ultra vires contract not enforceable under quantum meruit theory of recovery.</b> - Appellate court erred by holding that an environmental engineering company could recover against a city on the company's quantum meruit claim because quantum meruit was not an available remedy against the city since the claim was based on a municipal contract that was ultra vires as the contract was never approved by city council.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Duty to enter contracts upon minutes.</b> - Law imposes a duty upon those officers who govern the county's affairs to enter the contracts the officers make in behalf of the county upon the officers' minutes, and the continued neglect on the officer's part to discharge an official duty does not cause the duty to terminate.

<p class="p6">When a person has a written contract with a county, the person has the legal right to have the contract entered on the minutes of proper authorities and if the proper county authorities fail or refuse to enter such contract, the judge of the superior court should by mandamus compel the authorities to so enter the contract. In a proceeding for mandamus to compel the performance of such duty, the court will not inquire into the validity of the contract further than to see that on the contract's face the contract is prima facie valid. Douglas v. Austin-Western Rd. Mach. Co., 173 Ga. 834, 161 S.E. 811 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Who may apply for mandamus.</b> - When a contractor in the progress of work procured loans from a bank for the purpose of completing the loan, and gave written orders to the bank authorizing the bank to receive the remaining warrants issued under the contract, the bank had such a special interest as authorized the bank to proceed by mandamus to compel the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) to enter the building contract on the minutes. Jones v. Bank of Cumming, 131 Ga. 614, 63 S.E. 36 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Curative effect of mandamus.</b> - Entry after the completion of the work, in compliance with a judgment in mandamus proceedings instituted to compel the entry of the contract on the minutes, cures the defect resulting from a failure to enter the contract on the minutes before the work was begun or completed.

<p class="p6"><b>No time limit for entering on minutes.</b> - This section does not state when the contract must be entered on the minutes of the ordinary (now judge of the probate court) or county commission, nor does the statute say that the contract cannot be reduced to writing or signed by the parties at a date after the contract is made.

<p class="p6"><b>Specific contract must be entered.</b> - Although the superintendent of public works had general written authority, duly entered upon the minutes, of the board of commissioners of roads and revenues to employ men, if the specific contract with the plaintiff was not in writing and had never been entered upon the minutes of the board, the plaintiff cannot recover. Garner v. Floyd County, 24 Ga. App. 693, 101 S.E. 918 (1920).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Even if the supplement was paid in violation of the Open Meetings Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-14-1 et seq., the county's counterclaim was filed well outside the 90-day limitation period in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-14-1(b)(2).

<p class="p6"><b>County attorney.</b> - The exercise of the implied power conferred upon the county commissioners to designate a county attorney and to fix the attorney's term and salary may be effectually executed by a resolution of the county commissioners, duly passed and spread upon their minutes. Such transaction does not fall within the purview of this section, which requires all contracts entered into with other persons on behalf of the county to be in writing and entered on their minutes. The relation between the county and the county attorney does not rest upon contract, but arises from appointment impliedly authorized by legislative enactment. Templeman v.

<p class="p6">In an action against a county for the breach of an alleged contract with the county authorities in charge of the county's fiscal affairs, it is necessary to allege that the contract was in writing and was entered upon the minutes of such authorities in order to make the contract a valid and enforceable contract against the county. A failure to so allege makes the petition subject to general demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Sosebee v. Hall County, 50 Ga. App. 21, 177 S.E. 71 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Suit against a county, based upon an alleged contract with the county, is defective unless it is alleged that such contract is in writing and has been entered on the minutes as required by the statute.

<p class="p6">All contracts entered into with other persons on behalf of the county shall be in writing and entered upon its minutes. If the fiscal affairs of the county are in charge of a board of commissioners, the law applicable to judges of the probate court with respect to the management of county affairs governs. Unless there has been a full compliance with the statutory provisions relative to contracts with a county, which fact must appear from the plaintiffs' petition, the petition is subject to demurrer (now motion to dismiss).

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - This section, providing that "all claims against counties must be presented within 12 months after they accrue or become payable, or the same are barred," is not inconsistent with Ga. Const. 1976, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. II (see, now, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. II, Para. IX). Cobb v. Board of Comm'rs of Rds. &amp; Revenue, 151 Ga. App. 472, 260 S.E.2d 496 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Purpose of this section</b> is to afford the county an opportunity to investigate the claim and ascertain the evidence, and to avoid the incurrence of unnecessary litigation.

<p class="p6"><b>Rationale behind presentment of claim.</b> - Object of presenting a claim to a county before the institution of suit is to afford the county an opportunity to investigate the claim and ascertain the evidence, and to avoid the incurrence of unnecessary litigation. Davis v. Cobb County, 65 Ga. App. 533, 15 S.E.2d 814 (1941); Sikes v. Candler County, 247 Ga. 115, 274 S.E.2d 464 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Comparison with </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>36-33-5. - While former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-308 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5), providing for the filing of a claim against a municipality before suit against such municipality, is unlike the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1602 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-11-1) relative to the presentment of claims against a county, the objects and purposes of these two statutes are similar.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction with O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 33-24-51(b).</b> - Limited waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 33-24-51(b) does not implicate the 12-month presentation requirement under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-11-1.

<p class="p6"><b>Landowners' claims for nuisance, trespass, negligence, and violation of riparian rights.</b> - County was entitled to summary judgment on a landowner's claims for nuisance, trespass, negligence, and violation of riparian rights because the county had sovereign immunity as to all claims which did not amount to an inverse condemnation of the land, and the condemnation claim was barred by the landowner's failure to provide proper ante-litem notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-11-1 within 12 months of when the landowner's claim accrued.

<p class="p6"><b>Applicability of sovereign immunity to action between city and county.</b> - In a case involving taxation of alcoholic beverages, the city's claims against the county were not barred by sovereign immunity since the city and county were merely exercising their own respective home rule powers by collecting tax revenues for their own purposes, and neither was acting on behalf of the State of Georgia; thus, there was no sovereignty to be maintained.

<p class="p6"><b>Suit to hold governmental officer personally liable.</b> - Plaintiffs were not compelled to notify sheriff of the suit in advance of filing suit against the sheriff because a party seeking a money judgment holding a governmental officer or agent personally liable, albeit for actions in the officer's or agent's official capacity, is a suit against the individual and not the government. Strickland v. Wilson, 205 Ga. App. 91, 421 S.E.2d 94 (1992), cert. denied, 205 Ga. App. 901, 421 S.E.2d 94 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Salary of commissioner.</b> - This section is not applicable to allowances for salary of the road commissioner under a local law as the commissioner's salary is an allowance provided by law for the benefit of the commissioner as a public officer, and has no reference to contract or breach of duty.

<p class="p6"><b>Tax collector commissions.</b> - Since the duty of the county authorities to pay the tax collector commissions and the amount of commissions thus payable to the tax collector, as compensation to a public officer, are both fixed and determined by law, it is not incumbent upon the tax collector to present the collector's claim within 12 months in order to prevent it from becoming barred under this section.

<p class="p6"><b>Nuisance.</b> - When evidence shows that the extent of a nuisance has not increased, so as to amount to the additional taking of property or additional damages to the property owner inside the 12-month period, then any action is barred. However, if the nuisance occurs within or its extent is increased during the 12-month period so as to amount to an additional taking of property belonging to a party, then that portion of the property taken during the 12-month period would be actionable.

<p class="p6">Trial court did not err by failing to allow a property owner to assert the owner's nuisance claim against a county in relation to a second notice sent to the county because at best, the owner would only be allowed to assert a claim for a second time period if the owner could show that the extent of the nuisance had increased, so as to amount to the additional taking of property or additional damages to the property owner in the second 12-month period; the owner did not show that the county's taking increased after the original 12-month period.

<p class="p6">Trial court did not err by denying a county's motion for directed verdict on the ground that a property owner's ante-litem notice expressly limited the owner's trespass and nuisance claims to personal property damages only because a directed verdict was not demanded when the owner's notice was ambiguous at worst, and a reasonable person could construe the notice to refer to all of the owner's property, personal and real. Bailey v. Annistown Rd. Baptist Church, Inc., 301 Ga. App. 677, 689 S.E.2d 62 (2009), cert. denied, No. S10C0669, 2010 Ga. LEXIS 468 (Ga. 2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Taking private property.</b> - All claims against a county for taking or damaging private property for public uses must be filed within 12 months, and suit thereon for the depreciation in the market value must be instituted within the period of limitations stipulated by the law. It is not the policy of the law to permit the bringing of suits against counties from time to time for damages which might result by reason of negligently constructed public improvements constituting a nuisance. Bibb County v. Green, 42 Ga. App. 552, 156 S.E. 745 (1931); Jones v. Fulton County, 207 Ga. App. 397, 427 S.E.2d 802 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Materialman's liens.</b> - Materialman may bring suit against the county prior to the completion of the work, if the contractor is then insolvent; in such case, the time when the contractor becomes insolvent is the time when the loss results and the county becomes subject to suit. Standard Oil Co. v. Jasper County, 53 Ga. App. 804, 187 S.E. 307 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Claim against a county, for a loss by a person who furnished material for the building of a road to a contractor who was not required by the county to give bond is barred after the lapse of one year from the date when the contractor became insolvent, and from the date when the materialman's lien against the contractor became due.

<p class="p6"><b>Suits by imprisoned persons.</b> - While there is no statutorily imposed disability which would prevent an imprisoned person from suing, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-90 provides an imprisoned person the benefit of a statutory provision tolling the statutes of limitation. The result is that a person imprisoned has an option of bringing an action while incarcerated or waiting until the period of incarceration ends.

<p class="p6"><b>Presentation of claim to outside counsel for county satisfies presentment requirement.</b> - Trial court erred in awarding summary judgment to the county based on the fact that the letter from the plaintiff's attorney was not a proper presentment as the attorney for the county was not employed by the county in house because, to the extent that Coweta County v. Cooper, 318 Ga. App. 41 (2012), indicated that presentment could not properly be made to an outside county attorney, the supreme court disapproved of that decision; thus, notwithstanding that the county attorney was an outside attorney, the timely delivery of the plaintiff's otherwise adequate presentation of a claim against the county to the outside county attorney satisfied the statutory presentment requirement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-11-1.

<p class="p9"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Origin of section.</b> - This statute is not of statutory origin, and is not peculiar to Georgia. The statute is a codification of a principle which is applicable generally to legislative or governmental bodies. Aven v. Steiner Cancer Hosp., 189 Ga. 126, 5 S.E.2d 356 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - Framers of this section intended to preserve for municipal governments freedom from ordinances which bind and prevent free legislation in matters such as operating budgets. Brown v. City of E. Point, 152 Ga. App. 801, 264 S.E.2d 267 (1979), aff'd, 246 Ga. 144, 268 S.E.2d 912 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Standing of citizen-taxpayer.</b> - Absent expenditures of public revenue or performance of a duty owed to the public, a citizen-taxpayer has no standing in equity to challenge a council's action which allegedly binds future councils unless the citizen has special damages not shared by the general public. Juhan v. City of Lawrenceville, 251 Ga. 369, 306 S.E.2d 251 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Power to contract for future.</b> - All legislative bodies are limited in their legal capacity in such a manner as not to deprive succeeding bodies of the right to deal with matters involving the same questions as may arise from time to time in the future, and as the then present exigencies may require. But a municipal corporation may make a valid contract to continue for a reasonable time beyond the official term of the officers entering into the contract for the municipality. Horkan v. City of Moultrie, 136 Ga. 561, 71 S.E. 785 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No power to cede away governmental powers.</b> - Powers are conferred upon municipal corporations for public purposes, and as their legislative powers cannot be delegated, so they cannot be bargained or bartered away. Such corporations may make authorized contracts, but they have no power, as a party, to make contracts or pass bylaws which shall cede away, control, or embarrass their legislative or governmental powers, or which shall disable them from performing their public duties. Horkan v. City of Moultrie, 136 Ga. 561, 71 S.E. 785 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of section.</b> - This section prohibits, as ultra vires, the enactment of ordinances or the execution of contracts which are effective beyond the term of the commissioners then in office. Ledbetter Bros. v. Floyd County, 237 Ga. 22, 226 S.E.2d 730 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Contract which restricts governmental or legislative functions of a city council has been traditionally held to be a nullity, ultra vires, and void even though it may present a trap for the unwary in dealing with municipal corporations; the municipality would not be estopped from asserting the invalidity of such a contract at any time. Brown v. City of East Point, 246 Ga. 144, 268 S.E.2d 912 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Action void as ultra vires.</b> - Settlement agreement entered into by a county and the county's board of commissioners was void as an ultra vires act because it purported to forever bind the hands of future boards of commissioners regarding land use and zoning decisions for certain property. Buckhorn Ventures, LLC v. Forsyth County, 262 Ga. App. 299, 585 S.E.2d 229 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability to counties.</b> - Principle stated in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-30-3 applies to counties as well as to municipalities. Madden v. Bellew, 260 Ga. 530, 397 S.E.2d 687 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When power to grant franchises stems from Ga. L. 1976, p. 188, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 1 (see now O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 36-34-2(7)),</b> there was no violation of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-202 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-30-3). City of Lithonia v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 238 Ga. 339, 232 S.E.2d 832 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Section applicable to governmental, not proprietary functions.</b> - This section does not apply to a situation where a political subdivision is operating in a proprietary rather than a governmental capacity. Southern Airways Co. v. DeKalb County, 102 Ga. App. 850, 118 S.E.2d 234 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">While long-term commitments which could be characterized as proprietary have been permitted, attempts at binding arrangements with respect to governmental functions have been prohibited. Brown v. City of E. Point, 152 Ga. App. 801, 264 S.E.2d 267 (1979), aff'd, 246 Ga. 144, 268 S.E.2d 912 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Rules of procedure</b> passed by one legislative body are not binding upon subsequent legislative bodies operating within same jurisdiction; no legislative body can divest that body's successor of its legislative powers by passing ordinances or resolutions which deprive their successor of the power to exercise fully their legislative discretion, and each legislative body, when it meets, and unless restrained by the authority which created it, is without rules of procedure, and has inherent power to make its own rules without reference to the action of preceding bodies. South Ga. Power Co. v. Baumann, 169 Ga. 649, 151 S.E. 513 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability to authorities.</b> - This section does not prohibit authorities, as distinguished from municipalities, from entering long-term contracts: there is no basis for the assertion that it applies to authorities. City of Jonesboro v. Clayton County Water Auth., 136 Ga. App. 768, 222 S.E.2d 76 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Dismissal of a probationer's claims, seeking to invalidate the service contract between the state court and the private company that contracted to supervise the court's probationers and for money had and received, was proper due to failure to state a claim because there was no challenge to the alternative ground that the district court had relied on. Keen v. Judicial Alternatives of Ga., Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Dec. 17, 2015), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 55, 196 L. Ed. 2d 30 (U.S. 2016)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>If this section is too rigidly applied,</b> there would be few contracts which municipalities could legally enter into, since contracts, by definition, must be binding, and many of the contracts, to be practical and effective, must extend beyond the existing councils' terms because of the nature of their subject matter. Jonesboro Area Athletic Ass'n v. Dickson, 227 Ga. 513, 181 S.E.2d 852 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>One municipal council may not by ordinance bind itself</b> or the council's successors so as to prevent free legislation in matters of municipal government. Aven v. Steiner Cancer Hosp., 189 Ga. 126, 5 S.E.2d 356 (1939); Lawson v. City of Moultrie, 194 Ga. 699, 22 S.E.2d 592 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Ratification of contracts by subsequent council.</b> - Future council may be bound by the terms of a contract if that council either approves the terms of the contract or ratifies the contract. Brown v. City of E. Point, 246 Ga. 144, 268 S.E.2d 912 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Duration of contracts.</b> - Municipal corporation may make a valid contract to continue for a reasonable time beyond the official term of the officers entering into the contract for the municipality.

<p class="p6">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-30-3(a) does not prevent a contract from extending beyond the term of the commission in office at the time of the contract's execution. Unified Gov't v. North, 250 Ga. App. 432, 551 S.E.2d 798 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>While a municipality is not estopped to deny the validity of a contract</b> wholly beyond the municipality's powers, the municipality may be estopped by the exercise of contractual powers legally vested in the municipality, and even by the exercise of governmental powers, to prevent manifest injustice and wrongs to private persons, where the restraint placed upon a municipality to accomplish that purpose does not interfere with the exercise of governmental powers of the municipality. Brown v. City of E. Point, 246 Ga. 144, 268 S.E.2d 912 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Post-retirement benefits of Community Service Board's Executive Director not gratuities.</b> - After the community service board filed a declaratory judgment action against the board's former executive director, contending that the director's contract violated public policy and that the director was not entitled to payment and benefits for various reasons, and the director counterclaimed against the board, the trial court did not err in ruling in favor of the director because the board's broad powers encompassed all of the benefits paid to the director, and it did not show that any of the director's benefits fell outside of the provisions of the enabling legislation; the director was entitled to payment for any compensation related to performance already rendered; and the director's post-retirement benefits were not gratuities.

<p class="p6"><b>Municipal corporation acts in proprietary rather than governmental capacity in operating an electric distribution system.</b> - Restriction placed upon municipal corporations by this section relates only to its governmental functions. Therefore, there is generally no objection to a contract by a municipal corporation for a supply of electrical power which extends beyond the term of office of the officers making the contract. The only restriction is that it must be reasonable in length of time for which it is to extend. Johnson v. State, 107 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Agreement to accept payment in lieu of ad valorem taxes void.</b> - Any agreement reached by plaintiff city that it would accept a reasonable annual amount from defendant in lieu of ad valorem taxes was void as an ultra vires act because the effect of the agreement would be to bind successive city commissions indefinitely.

<p class="p6"><b>No agreement as to schedule of payments to city.</b> - When a contract is fully executed by a city and the only remaining obligations are payments owed to the city by the other party to the contract, but there is no agreement as to the annual sum to be paid beyond a certain year, no contract exists; the fact that the other party expects to pay some amount to be agreed upon, and does pay a certain amount annually for several years, does not show an agreement by it to pay, or by the city to accept, that amount.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Contract for exemption from sewer assessments.</b> - Under the provisions of this section, a contract made by a municipality with property owners, to exempt the owners from future sewer assessments, is ultra vires, even though upon faith of the agreement the property owners conveyed rights of way to the city and the city accepted and entered upon the contract. Accordingly, a subsequent council of the municipality is not prevented from levying and enforcing proper sewer assessments against such property owners. J.S.H. Co. v. City of Atlanta, 193 Ga. 1, 17 S.E.2d 55 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Easement for effluent line.</b> - Collateral agreements in the grant of an easement to a municipality for the purpose of constructing and maintaining an effluent line which relate to the manner of the line's maintenance cannot be effective beyond the term of the mayor and council accepting the easement and making the agreements, and beyond that time are void.

<p class="p6"><b>Contract for placement of bus stop benches.</b> - Pretermitting the applicability of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-30-3(a) to counties, the subsection would not invalidate a county's contract with a company for the placement of bus benches at transit system stops.

The contract must enable the municipality to comply with the state and federal pollution standards and to receive public allotments. In addition, the contract must comply with the statutory requirement that the private corporation be charged a rate never less than the actual cost to the municipality. A contract meeting the above requirements would not violate the statutory prohibition against binding successors in office. 1992 Op. Att'y Gen.

<p class="p11">A municipal corporation in this state is authorized to surrender its corporate charter when such municipal corporation has not functioned under the corporate charter for a period of ten years, by petitioning the superior court of the county in which the municipal corporation lies, such petition being made by a majority of the registered voters of the nonfunctioning municipal corporation. Thereupon, the judge of the superior court may receive the surrendered corporate charter and by order of the court declare the municipal corporation to be dissolved. Any order of any superior court judge dissolving any municipal corporation within this state will be furnished in duplicate to the Secretary of State and shall serve as notice upon the Secretary of State that the municipal corporation has, by order of the court, been dissolved as a municipal corporation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>General application of this section</b> has been to deny a city's right to permit obstructions that would constitute a nuisance and impede travel. City Council v. Shields, 108 Ga. App. 790, 134 S.E.2d 481 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Delegability of power to abolish, vacate or close street.</b> - Legislature may delegate to a municipal corporation the power to abolish, vacate, or close a street in a municipality. When a street is abolished or closed by a municipality by virtue of such delegated power, the interest of the public therein ceases, and the owners of the fee, who are presumptively the abutting landowners, become entitled to use the property without regard to the former servitude imposed upon the land. Harbuck v. Richland Box Co., 207 Ga. 537, 63 S.E.2d 333 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Streets are primarily intended for the use of travelers;</b> and a municipal corporation has no power, in the absence of express legislative authority, to allow a street to be used for any other purpose. City Council v. Reynolds, 122 Ga. 754, 50 S.E. 998 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Obstruction defined.</b> - Any permanent structure in a road which materially interferes with travel is a nuisance per se, and any obstruction permanent in nature or continuously maintained which interferes with the free use of the road by the public is a public nuisance, and it is immaterial that space may be left on either side of the obstruction for the passage of the public. The public has the right to the unobstructed use of the whole road as the road was acquired by the county or city. Harbuck v. Richland Box Co., 204 Ga. 352, 49 S.E.2d 883 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Use of streets not absolute.</b> - Use of streets and highways is not absolute and unrestricted, but is subject to reasonable regulation. Schlesinger v. City of Atlanta, 161 Ga. 148, 129 S.E. 861 (1925).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Limitations on right of public use.</b> - Right of the public to the free and unobstructed use of a street or public way is subject to reasonable and necessary limitations. The right to temporarily obstruct the street springs from the necessities of the case, and such right is necessarily limited by the necessity existing. Those who exercise the right must do so in such manner as will create the least possible inconvenience to others, and the impediment must be removed within a reasonable time. Harbuck v. Richland Box Co., 204 Ga. 352, 49 S.E.2d 883 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Section not basis for municipal liability.</b> - In the planning and the construction of a safety zone on a city street, the city was engaged in a governmental function and could not be held liable for any error in judgment in such planning. Beall v. City of Atlanta, 72 Ga. App. 760, 34 S.E.2d 918 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>This section is not primarily a safety measure,</b> and is not a basis for liability for injury caused indirectly by a condition in or adjacent to the traveled portion of the street. City Council v. Shields, 108 Ga. App. 790, 134 S.E.2d 481 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Specific Obstructions</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Permanent structures.</b> - Municipal corporation has no power, in the absence of express legislative authority, to authorize the erection of permanent structures in a public street, which interfere with the free use of such street by the public. Savannah &amp; W.R.R. v. Woodruff, 86 Ga. 94, 13 S.E. 156 (1890); Laing v. Mayor of Americus, 86 Ga. 756, 13 S.E. 107 (1891); City Council v. Jackson, 20 Ga. App. 710, 93 S.E. 304 (1917); Mayor of Savannah v. Markowitz, 155 Ga. 870, 118 S.E. 558 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Permissibility of noninterfering structures.</b> - Permanent structures which do not interfere with travel and which are erected for public purposes, such as telegraph and telephone poles, and the like, are permissible. But no permanent structure of any character which interferes in the slightest degree with the right of travel upon the street is ever permissible if such structure is erected for purely private purposes. City Council v. Reynolds, 122 Ga. 754, 50 S.E. 998 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Temporary obstructions.</b> - Temporary obstructions in a street are permissible under certain circumstances, even if the obstruction is for the benefit or convenience of an individual. The general rule is that if the purpose for which the obstruction is created is lawful, and the obstruction exists only for such a time as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose which brings about the necessity for the obstruction, such an obstruction would not be a public nuisance. City Council v. Reynolds, 122 Ga. 754, 50 S.E. 998 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Any temporary obstruction in a public street is presumptively a public nuisance,</b> and it is incumbent upon the persons responsible for the presence of such obstruction to show that the destruction was placed in the street in furtherance of a lawful and legitimate purpose, and has not been continued any longer than was reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of this purpose. City Council v. Reynolds, 122 Ga. 754, 50 S.E. 998 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Expenses incurred in erecting obstruction no defense.</b> - It is no reason for not removing the obstructions from a street that the plaintiff has incurred expense in erecting and maintaining the obstruction, and no lapse of time will render the license irrevocable. Laing v. Mayor of Americus, 86 Ga. 756, 13 S.E. 107 (1891); Mayor of Savannah v. Markowitz, 155 Ga. 870, 118 S.E. 558 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Obstructions "for purely private gain" are not permissible.</b> - Streets are primarily intended for the use of travelers, and any permanent structure in a street which materially interferes with travel thereon is a public nuisance. Permanent structures which do not interfere with travel, and which are erected for public purposes, such as telegraph and telephone poles, and the like, are permissible. City Council v. Reynolds, 122 Ga. 754, 50 S.E. 998 (1905); Butler v. City of Atlanta, 47 Ga. App. 341, 170 S.E. 539 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality of restriction of buses.</b> - Use of streets by common carriers for the purpose of gain is extraordinary and may be conditioned or prohibited as the legislature or municipality deems proper. Hence, if the state or city determines that the use of streets by buses should be restricted or prohibited there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States or this state which prohibits such action. Schlesinger v. City of Atlanta, 161 Ga. 148, 129 S.E. 861 (1925).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Use by streetcars.</b> - Legislature has expressly given to cities the power to permit the use of streets for the operation of streetcars, and has conferred upon the city commissioners the authority to determine the location of trolley poles by provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-301 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-100(5)). Townsend v. Georgia Power Co., 44 Ga. App. 132, 160 S.E. 712 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Medians.</b> - When a median does not interfere with the plaintiffs' ingress and egress to plaintiff's properties but requires mere circuity of travel only, abutting landowners have no cause of action as this section does not apply. Hadwin v. Mayor of Savannah, 221 Ga. 148, 143 S.E.2d 734 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction of "safety islands".</b> - Municipality and street railroad companies operating within its limits have the power, without being guilty of maintaining a nuisance or committing thereby an act of negligence per se, to authorize the construction and maintenance of, and to construct and maintain under such municipal authority, what are termed "safety islands" or "safety zones" in streets at the side of a streetcar line, for the use and safety of the public from automobile and other traffic when entering and departing from streetcars. Butler v. City of Atlanta, 47 Ga. App. 341, 170 S.E. 539 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipal ordinance which was an attempt to vacate 20 feet of a public street</b> for the benefit of a private corporation is in excess of statutory authority. Harbuck v. Richland Box Co., 204 Ga. 352, 49 S.E.2d 883 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Constructing bridges.</b> - City may in the proper exercise of the city's discretion, and as a movement in the direction of public improvement, build a bridge in one of the city's streets, and, incidentally, close the street during the reasonable duration of the work. In like manner, the municipal authorities may authorize a railroad company to build the bridge for the benefit of the city, giving the company power to close the street for a reasonable time while the work is being done. Adair v. City of Atlanta, 124 Ga. 288, 52 S.E. 739 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>City's right to obstruct street.</b> - When it is not prohibited by law, a city may legally erect and maintain an obstruction in one of the city's streets, provided the obstruction is not dangerous, and does not constitute an unreasonable interference with the lawful use of the street. South Ga. Power Co. v. Smith, 42 Ga. App. 100, 155 S.E. 80 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Such amount shall be determined based on county resolutions and any attachments thereto, staff recommendations, or similar documents presented at the time of passage of a resolution, county records, and any public statements or representations made by county managers, representatives, officials, or their agents as to the amount that would be spent on such park in order to solicit voter support for the referendum; provided, however, that the amount to be transferred by the county to the municipality shall be reduced by any amount spent by the county to improve such park prior to the date of the municipality's notice of its election to purchase the park as provided in subsection (f) of this Code section.

<p class="p9"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Legislature has unfortunately codified the doctrine of municipal immunity</b> into statutory law to the extent that the judicial branch of government has been preempted from effectively destroying that which the judiciary created. City of Atlanta v. Mapel, 121 Ga. App. 567, 174 S.E.2d 599 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Violation of duty to act.</b> - When the city knows or ought to know of a defect, in time to repair or give warning of the defect, the city is liable for injuries sustained because of the defect regardless of the defect's cause. City of Rome v. Brinkley, 54 Ga. App. 391, 187 S.E. 911 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">If a municipality did not perform an act creating a dangerous condition, the failure of the municipality to rectify the dangerous condition must be in violation of a duty to act. Mayor of Savannah v. Palmerio, 242 Ga. 419, 249 S.E.2d 224 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In action to recover overcharges for electricity, defendant-municipality has legal duty to disclose existence of more favorable demand meter rate. City of Commerce v. Duncan &amp; Godfrey, Inc., 157 Ga. App. 337, 277 S.E.2d 266 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No distinction between negligent and intentional torts.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 69-301 and 69-307 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 36-33-1 and 36-33-3) did not distinguish between torts of nonfeasance or misfeasance committed by negligence, and other torts committed corruptly, maliciously, willfully, or wantonly. Brown v. City of Union Point, 52 Ga. App. 212, 183 S.E. 78 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability to federal actions.</b> - State cannot impose conditions precedent to the right of a party to proceed under 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1983. Williams v. Posey, 475 F. Supp. 133 (M.D. Ga. 1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability to diversity actions.</b> - In a diversity action against a Georgia city arising out of an accident in South Carolina involving a city garbage truck, even though the city would not be entitled to sovereign immunity under South Carolina law, immunity enjoyed by the city under Georgia law would be extended as a matter of comity. Davis v. City of Augusta, 942 F. Supp. 577 (S.D. Ga. 1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Inapplicable when waiver of immunity undisputed.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1 does not create a duty on the part of cities to perform all acts properly and skillfully; the statute simply creates an exception from sovereign immunity for cities' negligence in proprietary or nongovernmental matters and did not apply in a case where defendants' waiver of sovereign immunity was undisputed. City of Buford v. Ward, 212 Ga. App. 752, 443 S.E.2d 279 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of demand statute.</b> - Before the enactment of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-308 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5), requiring a demand, the liability of every municipal corporation in Georgia, under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-301 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1), was unqualified and unconditional; by the enactment of the law requiring a demand this unqualified liability of each municipal corporation became conditional upon the demand required by the statute. City of Atlanta v. Hudgins, 193 Ga. 618, 19 S.E.2d 508 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice requirement.</b> - Notice must be given to hold liable a municipality for negligent ministerial acts. Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. R.D.C., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 1163 (N.D. Ga. 1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Establishment of waiver.</b> - Sovereign immunity is not an affirmative defense that must be established by the party seeking its protection; waiver of immunity must be established by the party seeking to benefit from the waiver. City of Lawrenceville v. Macko, 211 Ga. App. 312, 439 S.E.2d 95 (1993), overruled on other grounds by Clive v. Gregory, 280 Ga. App. 836, 635 S.E.2d 188, 2006 Ga. App. LEXIS 880 (Ga. Ct. App. 2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sovereign immunity waived only by legislative act.</b> - Relying on the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a), the Georgia Supreme Court concluded that sovereign immunity could be waived only by an act of the legislature and, therefore, the indemnification agreement between the city and a corporation was void as an ultra vires contract; however, the case was remanded to the federal district court for consideration of whether, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a), the city waived the city's sovereign immunity as to the corporation's cause of action by purchasing insurance. CSX Transp., Inc. v. City of Garden City, 355 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. 2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Purchase of liability insurance no waiver of immunity.</b> - Absent statutory authority limiting the application of the provisions of this chapter, the procurement of liability insurance by the city does not constitute a waiver of the defense of sovereign immunity insofar as this defense bars recovery for damages caused by the performance of a governmental function in a negligent manner. Winston v. City of Austell, 123 Ga. App. 183, 179 S.E.2d 665 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Evidence did not show that the city waived the city's governmental immunity by purchasing liability insurance; thus, the city had governmental immunity on the individual's claims against the city arising out of the police officer's arrest of the individual for criminal trespass. Reese v. City of Atlanta, 261 Ga. App. 761, 583 S.E.2d 584 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Waiver by purchase of liability insurance.</b> - Even if spraying for mosquito eradication is a governmental function, if as provided for in Ga. L. 1960, p. 289, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 33-24-51), the city secures insurance to cover liability for damages arising by reason of ownership, maintenance, operation, or use of any motor vehicle by the municipal corporation, under the municipality's management, control or supervision, whether in a governmental undertaking or not, the municipality's governmental immunity shall be waived to the extent of the amount of insurance so purchased. Mitchell v. City of St. Marys, 155 Ga. App. 642, 271 S.E.2d 895 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In a tort action for personal injuries and property damage arising from an auto collision filed against a city and the city's police officer, the trial court erred in granting a city summary judgment as: (1) O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-6(d)(2) did not apply; and (2) the city waived the city's sovereign immunity to the extent that the city purchased liability coverage to cover the officer's actions in operating that officer's police car. But, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the officer, given that the officer was engaged in a discretionary function of responding to an emergency situation at the time the accident at issue occurred. Weaver v. City of Statesboro, 288 Ga. App. 32, 653 S.E.2d 765 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0421, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 221 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In a negligence action against a city by plaintiffs injured in a collision with an on-duty police officer, the city's purchase of a general liability insurance policy covering claims in excess of $250,000 waived the city's sovereign immunity to the limits of the policy; since the city did not have a self-insurance plan, participate in any sort of insurance fund or pool, or set aside funds for the payment of liability claims, plaintiffs could recover only damages exceeding the $250,000 threshold. McLemore v. City Council, 212 Ga. 862, 443 S.E.2d 505 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">City was not entitled to sovereign immunity because the city's "Public Officials Errors and Omissions" insurance policy covered the wrongful termination claims brought by city employees; therefore, consistent with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a), the city was deemed to have waived sovereign immunity to the extent of the limits of the city's insurance policy covering those claims. Owens v. City of Greenville, 290 Ga. 557, 722 S.E.2d 755 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Although a fact issue existed as to whether a city had waived the city's sovereign immunity by purchasing insurance that covered an arrestee's claims arising from an arrest for burglary, the claims for slander, fraud, false imprisonment, and racketeering failed because there was probable cause to make the arrest. Gray v. Ector, 541 Fed. Appx. 920 (11th Cir. 2013)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Insufficient proof of liability insurance.</b> - Because there was no evidence of record that a city maintained liability insurance that would cover the occurrences forming the basis of the developers' claims, there was no waiver of the city's sovereign immunity pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a); thus, sovereign immunity was a viable defense as to the city and the city officials acting in their official capacities. Wendelken v. JENK LLC, 291 Ga. App. 30, 661 S.E.2d 152 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Charter provision constitutional.</b> - A 1983 amendment to the charter of the consolidated local government of Columbus which provided that the tort liability of the consolidated government would be the tort liability applicable to counties was valid and constitutional. Bowen v. City of Columbus, 256 Ga. 462, 349 S.E.2d 740 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Waiver by municipality.</b> - According to the Georgia Supreme Court, Georgia municipalities may never waive a municipality's sovereign immunity by, for example, contracting to indemnify third parties without either express legislative authority or satisfying the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a). CSX Transp., Inc. v. City of Garden City, 355 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. 2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Unified city/county government</b> was not a municipality for purposes of the waiver of sovereign immunity by operation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1 because the charter creating the unified government expressly provided that the government's tort and nuisance liability would follow the law and rules of tort liability applicable to counties in Georgia. Athens-Clarke County v. Torres, 246 Ga. App. 215, 540 S.E.2d 225 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No immunity for breach of contract.</b> - Municipal immunity is not a valid defense to an action for breach of contract. Precise v. City of Rossville, 261 Ga. 210, 403 S.E.2d 47 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Insufficient proof of insurance.</b> - Resident who brought a negligence and nuisance suit against a city had not shown that the city waived sovereign immunity under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1 because a letter from a firm stating that the firm administered the city's insurance program did not suffice to show that the city had insurance. Gilbert v. City of Jackson, 287 Ga. App. 326, 651 S.E.2d 461 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Liability for contract and non-sovereign immunity torts.</b> - Contract that included indemnification provision was void because a city could not waive the city's sovereign immunity under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1; although it was not clear whether the city could waive non-sovereign immunity torts and contract claims, because a train track and train owner confined itself to a sovereign immunity tort recovery theory while proceeding on only a contract claim without seeking leave to amend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), the plaintiffs' entire case against the city failed as a matter of law. CSX Transp., Inc. v. City of Garden City, 418 F. Supp. 2d 1366 (S.D. Ga. 2006), aff'd, 258 Fed. Appx. 287 (11th Cir. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Court must apply proper analysis.</b> - Judgment of the appellate court affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment to a city based on sovereign immunity was vacated because the appellate court, like the trial court's ruling on the city's motion, gave no consideration to whether the alleged negligence by the city occurred in the performance of a governmental function and did not acknowledge or apply the definitions of governmental and ministerial functions as those terms relate to the city's sovereign immunity. Primas v. City of Milledgeville, 296 Ga. 584, 769 S.E.2d 326 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No contractual agreement established with city through statutes or ordinances.</b> - In a suit brought by taxi cab companies, the trial court properly granted the city's motion to dismiss because the taxi cab companies failed to establish that the statutes permitting the issuance of Certificates of Public Necessity and Convenience (CPNC), or the city's ordinances, created a clear and unequivocal intent by the city to create a contractual or franchise agreement that prevented the city allowing personal transportation network companies to operate in the city. Atlanta Metro Leasing, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 353 Ga. App. 785, 839 S.E.2d 278 (2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nonliability for Governmental Functions</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Policy of section.</b> - Municipality performs governmental functions in the exercise of certain of the municipality's corporate powers, because such powers are exercised by the municipality for the benefit of the public generally, and in their exercise it represents and is an arm of the state, such as the municipality's exercise of powers pertaining to the public health and to the maintenance of charitable, penal, reformatory, and similar public institutions. However, when the municipality exercises only such powers and privileges as are peculiarly for the municipality's own benefit, or the benefit of the municipality's own citizens, or those of the municipality's immediate locality, the municipality is acting in a strictly corporate capacity. Brannan v. City of Brunswick, 49 Ga. App. 62, 174 S.E. 186 (1934); Watkins v. City of Toccoa, 54 Ga. App. 8, 189 S.E. 270 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">City was immune from liability under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(b) because the issuance of an arrest warrant was a judicial act performed by a judicial officer. Griffin v. City of Brunswick, (S.D. Ga. Nov. 30, 2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Rule of nonliability while performing delegated duties.</b> - When a municipality undertakes to perform for the state duties which the state itself might perform, but which have been delegated to the municipality, and in the exercise of such function a private citizen is injured by the negligence of servants while engaged in such work, no cause of action arises against the municipality. Mayor of Savannah v. Jordon, 142 Ga. 409, 83 S.E. 109 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Rule of nonliability generally.</b> - For acts done in the illegal performance of purely governmental functions, that is for failure to perform or errors in performing the government's legislative or judicial powers, as distinguished from neglect to perform or improper or unskillful performance of the government's ministerial duties, however illegally the authority may be exercised, a municipality is not liable. Brown v. City of Union Point, 52 Ga. App. 212, 183 S.E. 78 (1935); Foster v. Mayor of Savannah, 77 Ga. App. 346, 48 S.E.2d 686 (1948); City of Thomson v. Davis, 92 Ga.

<p class="p6">Municipalities are not legally compellable or liable to pay claims arising by reason of negligence in the performance of the municipalities' governmental functions unless the legislature has delegated to the municipalities the power and authority to waive immunity from suit on claims arising because of negligence in the performance of such governmental functions. Koehler v. Massell, 229 Ga. 359, 191 S.E.2d 830 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When a homeowner claimed that the negligent repair of a sewer system caused a water main near a house to rupture, damaging the owner's home, the owner could not hold the city liable for the damage because the maintenance and repair of a sewer system was a governmental function, and, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a), the city could not be held liable for negligent acts of the city's employee in the performance of purely governmental functions. Goode v. City of Atlanta, 274 Ga. App. 233, 617 S.E.2d 210 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Distinction between governmental and ministerial duties.</b> - Between a municipality and the public, the question of liability depends on whether at the time of the injury sued for the municipality was engaged in a governmental or ministerial duty.

<p class="p6"><b>City's decision not to revoke an occupational tax certificate.</b> - City was entitled to sovereign immunity against a claim by a decedent's survivors that the city allowed a known nuisance in the form of an unauthorized and unlicensed nightclub to continue attracting drugs and crime, resulting in the decedent's shooting death outside the nightclub; the city was exercising a governmental function when the city opted not to revoke the nightclub's occupational tax certificate and, therefore, was protected by immunity under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(b). City of Albany v. Stanford, 347 Ga. App. 95, 815 S.E.2d 322 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Acts of mayor in fixing bond.</b> - Municipal corporation is not liable for the act of the mayor in requiring the plaintiff to give a larger bond than the law authorized. In fixing the amount of the bond, the mayor acted in a judicial capacity, and for an error committed in the exercise of judicial authority a municipal corporation is not liable. Gray v. Mayor of Griffin, 111 Ga. 361, 36 S.E. 792 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Traffic signals.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a city on a parent's negligence claim against the city stemming from a child's serious automobile accident at a known dangerous intersection that was inappropriately signaled because the city was immune from suit as the issue of whether to install a traffic signal at the intersection was a discretionary act, entitling the city to sovereign immunity; further, a successful tax referendum to fund a new traffic light did not create a duty to install a traffic light at the intersection before completing other projects. Riggins v. City of St. Marys, 264 Ga. App. 95, 589 S.E.2d 691 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Officer acting in official capacity applying sovereign immunity.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a city and the city's police officers summary judgment as to an arrestee's claims against the city and the officers in the officers' official capacities because the claim against one of the officers in the officer's official capacity was, in reality, a suit against a governmental entity and subject to a claim of sovereign immunity, and no genuine issue of fact remained as to whether the city waived the city's sovereign immunity pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 33-24-51; the alleged negligence was unrelated to the use of a motor vehicle. Campbell v. Goode, 304 Ga. App. 47, 695 S.E.2d 44 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>City immune in action alleging negligence and maintenance of nuisance.</b> - In an action alleging negligence and maintenance of a nuisance against the city, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the city on the nuisance claim because the actions challenged, including disregarding alcohol violations, involved a governmental function to which sovereign immunity applied and because the insurance policy did not cover the claims, there was no legislative waiver of sovereign immunity. Gatto v. City of Statesboro, 353 Ga. App. 178, 834 S.E.2d 623 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Ed. 2d 557 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Corporate capacity defined.</b> - When a municipality exercises only such powers and privileges as are peculiarly for the municipality's own benefit, or the benefit of the municipality's own citizens, or those of the municipality's immediate locality, the municipality is acting in a strictly corporate capacity. Watkins v. City of Toccoa, 54 Ga. App. 8, 189 S.E. 270 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Rule of liability generally.</b> - Municipal corporation in the exercise of the municipality's corporate functions performs two classes of service: (1) governmental duties; and (2) private, corporate, or ministerial, duties. It seems well settled in this state that in the negligent performance of a municipality's<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>governmental duties a municipal corporation is not liable in damages to one who is injured while the municipality is engaged in the performance of such duties. But a different rule obtains if in the exercise or neglect of the municipality's ministerial duties one is negligently injured by a municipal corporation. Brannan v. City of Brunswick, 49 Ga. App. 62, 174 S.E. 186 (1934); Watkins v. City of Toccoa, 54 Ga. App. 8, 189 S.E.2d 270 (1936); Taylor v. King, 104 Ga. App. 589, 122 S.E.2d 265 (1961); Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. R.D.C., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 1163 (N.D. Ga. 1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Municipality is immune from suit for acts the municipality performs which are authorized by law and executed in accordance with the judgment or conclusion reached by the municipal authority in the exercise of a governmental function. However, a municipality is liable when there is negligence or error in the execution of plans or specifications, adopted or prescribed by a municipality, that is, for negligence or error in the exercise of a ministerial duty, a municipal government is not liable for negligence in the exercise of a governmental function. Mayor of Savannah v. Palmerio, 242 Ga. 419, 249 S.E.2d 224 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Payment of salary to government employees</b> is a perfunctory administrative duty not included under the category of government functions and is not barred by any statutory immunity. Smith v. City of Atlanta, 167 Ga. App. 458, 306 S.E.2d 720 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">To bar a municipal employee from recovering pay for services the employee performed by allowing the municipality to claim statutory immunity would violate the prohibition against the impairment of a contract which is found in both the state and federal constitutions.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Waiver of liability for ministerial duties does not apply to counties.</b> - Waiver of sovereign immunity for claims alleging the negligent performance of ministerial duties only applies to cities and does not apply to counties. O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(b) provides that for neglect to perform or improper or unskillful performance of their ministerial duties, municipal corporations shall be liable. O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-1-4 sets out the sovereign immunity of counties and contains no such waiver for ministerial duties. Klingensmith v. Long County, 352 Ga. App. 21, 833 S.E.2d 608 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Facility designed to maximize revenues.</b> - Municipality may be liable for failure to safely maintain a public facility, even though the municipality is not expressly given the power to operate the facility primarily as a source of revenue, if the facility is in fact designed to "maximize" revenues rather than to be operated primarily for the general good of the public; the duty of proper maintenance would, in such a case, be ministerial. Cleghorn v. City of Albany, 184 Ga. App. 732, 362 S.E.2d 386, cert. denied, 184 Ga. App. 909, 362 S.E.2d 386 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>When city maintained a market house</b> the city is under a duty to keep the market house in a safe condition, the market house being property of the city and used for the city's revenues.

Cullens, 38 Ga. 334 (1868).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Improvement of streets by city.</b> - Defense of sovereign immunity was not available to the city, when the city's management of the project included hiring the contractor and placing the city's on-site construction inspector on the property to actively oversee the construction work on a daily basis. Consequently, the city was performing a ministerial function in improving the streets and sidewalks. City of Atlanta v. Atlantic Realty Co., 205 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>Failure to provide medical care to inmate.</b> - In a negligence action filed by an inmate based on the city's and the police chief's failure to provide medical care to the inmate, because the provision of medical care to inmates in the city's and the police chief's custody was a ministerial act, as the duty was imposed by statute, and medical care was a fundamental right of inmates in custody, sovereign or governmental immunity was not applicable, and the trial court did not err by denying the city's and the police chief's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim based on sovereign immunity. City of Atlanta v. Mitcham, 262 Ga. App. 754, 586 S.E.2d 430 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The care of inmates in the custody of a municipal corporation is a governmental function for which sovereign immunity has not been waived. City of Atlanta v. Mitcham, 296 Ga. 576, 769 S.E.2d 320 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Inmate precluded from pursuing negligence claim.</b> - Appellate court erred by affirming a trial court's denial of a city's motion to dismiss an inmate's complaint because the care of inmates in the custody of a municipal corporation is a governmental function for which sovereign immunity has not been waived; therefore, the inmate was precluded from pursuing negligence claims. City of Atlanta v. Mitcham, 296 Ga. 576, 769 S.E.2d 320 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Liability for personal injury from continuing nuisance.</b> - A line of cases hold municipalities liable for personal injuries resulting from a continuing nuisance despite this section must be read to be a common-law exception to the general statutory rule that municipalities are immune. Miree v. United States, 526 F.2d 679 (5th Cir.), different results reached on rehearing, 538 F.2d 643 (5th Cir. 1976), judgment en banc vacated, 433 U.S. 25, 97 S. Ct. 2490, 53 L.

<p class="p6"><b>To be held liable for maintenance of a nuisance,</b> a municipality must be chargeable with performing a continuous or regularly repetitious act, or creating a continuous or regularly repetitious condition which causes the hurt, inconvenience, or injury; the municipality must have knowledge or be chargeable with notice of the dangerous condition. Mayor of Savannah v. Palmerio, 242 Ga. 419, 249 S.E.2d 224 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What is nuisance.</b> - That which the law authorizes to be done, if done as the law authorizes, cannot be a nuisance. Thus, if the act is lawful in itself, the act becomes a nuisance only when conducted in an illegal manner to the hurt, inconvenience, or damage of another. Mayor of Savannah v. Palmerio, 242 Ga. 419, 249 S.E.2d 224 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Negligence not essential ingredient in action against municipality</b> - When a municipality in the exercise of the municipality's functions, both governmental and ministerial, creates a nuisance which is specially injurious to an individual, such individual may have a cause of action for damages, and negligence is not an essential ingredient of the action. Foster v. Mayor of Savannah, 77 Ga. App. 346, 48 S.E.2d 686 (1948); Ingram v. City of Acworth, 90 Ga. App. 719, 84 S.E.2d 99 (1954); City of Thomson v. Davis, 92 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>Sovereign immunity for negligence but not nuisance.</b> - Trial court erred in not granting a city's motion to dismiss the negligence claims against the city because the city was exercising a governmental function when the city demolished an abandoned house which was claimed to be a nuisance; therefore, the city was entitled to sovereign immunity on those claims. City of Atlanta v. Durham, 324 Ga. App. 563, 751 S.E.2d 172 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Training of police officers.</b> - Plaintiff's claims against the city that training of the city's police in the operation of police cars created a nuisance failed as a one-time occurrence of a car collision was insufficient evidence to prove a specific failure or specific negligence in training. Banks v. Mayor of Savannah, 210 Ga. App. 62, 435 S.E.2d 68 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Adjoining landowners.</b> - Municipality, as owner of real estate, owes the same duties to the owners of neighboring lands, with respect to the use of the municipality's own, as are owed by a private owner of land, and hence a municipality is liable to other landowners when it makes such use of the municipality's land as to constitute a nuisance, regardless of whether the municipality is engaged in performing a governmental or private function. This rule is equally applicable whether the actual injury is personal or property damage. Stanley v. City of Macon, 95 Ga. App. 108, 97 S.E.2d 330 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Increased noise and odors.</b> - Term property comprehends not only the thing possessed, but also, in strict legal parlance, means the rights of the owner in relation to land or a thing; the right of a person to possess, use, enjoy, and dispose of the land or thing, and the corresponding right to exclude others from the use. Therefore, no physical invasion damaging to the property need be shown, only an unlawful interference with the right of the owner to enjoy the owner's<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>possession. Thus, increased noise and odors may result in an inverse condemnation of property by interfering with the use and enjoyment of land and endangering health. Duffield v.

<p class="p6"><b>Overflowing water.</b> - When a municipality, in constructing a public improvement, obstructs the natural flow of surface water so as to cause the water to pond upon the land of an abutting owner, and the city provides no means of outlet for such water, the city becomes liable to the property owner for any damages occasioned to the landowner's property thereby. If the ponding of such water on private property constitutes a nuisance, which the city fails to abate, the municipality may be held liable. City of Rome v. Brown, 54 Ga.

This construction would leave intact the common-law doctrine, frequently applied in this state before and since adoption of the Code, of nonliability for conduct of officers, agents, and servants of municipal corporations in respect to duties devolving upon the officers, agents, and servants in virtue of the sovereign or governmental functions of the municipality.

<p class="p6"><b>Summary judgment based on sovereign immunity improper.</b> - Trial court erred in granting a police officer and a city summary judgment on the ground that the officer was performing a discretionary duty and the city was protected by sovereign immunity in an arrestee's action to recover damages for injuries sustained when the officer ran over the arrestee's foot with a patrol car during the arrest. A jury could<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>find that the officer did not act intentionally, but rather, negligently came too close to the arrestee.

The fact that the auditorium might be used for profit on other occasions would not render the city liable to one injured at the time the auditorium was being used strictly for governmental purposes.

On the other hand, the prescription of standards which must be met to obtain a license is legislation, since these standards are authoritative guides for future conduct derived from an assessment of the needs of the community. A governmental agency entrusted with the licensing power, therefore, functions as a legislature when the agency prescribes these standards, but the same agency acts as a judicial body when the agency makes a determination that a specific applicant has or has not satisfied the requirements. 106 Forsyth Corp. v.

<p class="p6"><b>Waiver in 1983 pursuant to state constitution.</b> - Despite the language limiting O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a)'s effect to litigation pending after July 1, 1986, a municipality's defense of sovereign immunity is automatically waived to the extent of any applicable general liability insurance coverage carried by the municipality for actions filed as of the effective date in 1983 of Ga. Const., 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Para. IX. Brockman v. Burnette, 184 Ga. App. 66, 360 S.E.2d 655 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Indemnification agreement with railroad.</b> - When the city entered into agreements with the railroad to utilize a right-of-way for water and sewer lines, and an accident later subjected the railroad to damages, and claims by third parties, because nothing in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1 could be construed to permit a municipality to waive its sovereign immunity by contracting to indemnify a third party, the indemnification agreement between the city and the railroad was void as an ultra vires contract. Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(a), it was the purchase of insurance that effectuated the waiver of sovereign immunity; thus, it was irrelevant that the invalid indemnification agreement covered occurrences to which sovereign immunity both did and did not apply.

<p class="p6"><b>Municipal corporation cannot be held liable for failure to perform duty</b> when duty of performance has not been imposed upon the corporation by law, and which the corporation has no power to perform, for lack of authority to raise revenue for that purpose. Mayor of Montezuma v. Law, 1 Ga. App. 579, 57 S.E. 1025 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Clear line is drawn between a discretionary nonfeasance</b> and the negligent maintenance of something erected by the city in the city's discretion in such manner as to create a dangerous nuisance, and which amounts to misfeasance. In a case of discretionary nonfeasance on the part of the defendant city, the defendant city is not liable. Tamas v. City of Columbus, 244 Ga. 200, 259 S.E.2d 457 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>School crossing guard</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-2 may not be applicable when a city fails to provide a substitute school crossing guard at an intersection which was normally attended by a crossing guard, even though the city was not required by statute to provide a crossing guard. Whiddon v. O'Neal, 171 Ga. App. 636, 320 S.E.2d 601 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Whether a city will open a street is discretionary with the city,</b> and the exercise of the city's discretion, one way or the other, gives no right of action to anyone who may have miscalculated the final action of the city. Pittman v. City of Jesup, 232 Ga. 635, 208 S.E.2d 456 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to identify school safety crossings.</b> - City did not create a nuisance by failing to identify school safety crossings across a public roadway in front of a school. McLaughlin v. City of Roswell, 161 Ga. App. 759, 289 S.E.2d 18 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to erect traffic light.</b> - In the absence of a law or ordinance requiring the defendant to erect a traffic light at an intersection as a result of which the plaintiff was allegedly injured, the erection and maintenance of such a signal is discretionary, and a city or county cannot be held liable for mere failure to perform such an act. McLaughlin v. City of Roswell, 161 Ga. App. 759, 289 S.E.2d 18 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a city on a parent's negligence claim against the city stemming from a child's serious automobile accident at a known dangerous intersection that was inappropriately signaled because the city was immune from suit as the issue of whether to install a traffic signal at the intersection was a discretionary act, entitling the city to sovereign immunity; further, a successful tax referendum to fund a new traffic light did not create a duty to install a traffic light at the intersection before completing other projects. Riggins v. City of St. Marys, 264 Ga. App. 95, 589 S.E.2d 691 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to maintain stop sign in a visible condition.</b> - Driver's allegations of negligence against a city for negligent maintenance of a stop sign, which was allegedly obscured by foliage, were subject to summary judgment based on the city's sovereign immunity pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1(b). The driver's nuisance claim was barred because the driver failed to show the city's awareness of a problem with the stop sign. Albertson v. City of Jesup, 312 Ga. App. 246, 718 S.E.2d 4 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0398, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 245 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to maintain drainage culvert.</b> - Summary judgment was granted in favor of a city upon a father's claim of negligence under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 32-4-93(a) because: (1) there was no showing that the city had a legal duty to expand the culvert pipe in which the father's son drowned, to widen the shoulder of the street, or to erect a guardrail as no statute required the city to take these actions, and the city's construction code did not impose a duty with regard to the culvert; (2) there was no evidence that the city negligently maintained the culvert; and (3) the city had no actual or constructive notice of flooding problems near the culvert or of defects in the culvert. Walden v. City of Hawkinsville,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(M.D. Ga. Sept. 21, 2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No discretionary nonfeasance on the part of the city.</b> - Grant of summary judgment in favor of the city in a wrongful-death action was improper because there was evidence that the decedent had to walk in the same direction as the truck that struck the decedent was traveling; thus, there was an inference of causation. That specification of negligence was an act of misfeasance, for which the city might have been held liable, rather than discretionary nonfeasance, for which the city could not have been held liable pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-2. Butler v. Carlisle, 299 Ga. App. 815, 683 S.E.2d 882 (2009), cert. denied, No. S10C0052, 2010 Ga. LEXIS 155 (Ga. 2010), overruled on other grounds by Mercer Univ. v. Stofer, 830 S.E.2d 169, 2019 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>County was under no duty to build bridge across creek</b> which under normal circumstances was safe to ford and therefore not liable for death of car occupants who drowned when creek flooded over ford as car was passing over the ford. Dollar v. Haralson County, 704 F.2d 1540 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 963, 104 S. Ct. 399, 78 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sewage back up.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to a city on a property owner's nuisance claim because evidence existed that the property had been subjected to repeated flooding and that the city had notice of the problem, creating a jury issue as to whether the city had created a nuisance by failing to install a back flow preventer as the city had done for other properties. J. N. Legacy Group v. City of Dallas, 322 Ga. App. 475, 745 S.E.2d 721 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to construct barrier on top of retaining wall.</b> - In a case in which the plaintiff fell over an 18-foot retaining wall, which had no barrier on top, the trial court erred in denying the city's motion for a directed verdict because no statute or ordinance required the city to construct such a barrier. City of Alpharetta v. Hamby, 352 Ga. App. 511, 835 S.E.2d 366 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Demolition of abandoned house.</b> - Trial court erred in not granting a city's motion to dismiss the negligence claims against the city because the city was exercising a governmental function when the city demolished an abandoned house which was claimed to be a nuisance; therefore, the city was entitled to sovereign immunity on those claims. City of Atlanta v. Durham, 324 Ga. App. 563, 751 S.E.2d 172 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Rule of nonliability generally.</b> - Municipal corporation is not liable for the negligence of the municipality's officers and employees when acting in a governmental function. Banks v. City of Albany, 83 Ga. App. 640, 64 S.E.2d 93 (1951); Bagwell v. City of Gainesville, 106 Ga. App. 367, 126 S.E.2d 906 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No distinction between negligent and intentional torts.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 69-301 and 69-307 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 36-33-1 and 36-33-3) did not suggest any intention to distinguish between torts of nonfeasance or misfeasance committed by negligence, and other torts committed corruptly, maliciously, willfully, or wantonly. Brown v. City of Union Point, 52 Ga. App. 212, 183 S.E. 78 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When liability arises.</b> - Municipalities are liable for the acts of a municipalities' officers, agents, and servants only in instances as follows: (a) in the performance of any function when a statute specifically provides for such liability; (b) for neglect to perform or improper or unskillful performance of the municipalities' ministerial duties; and (c) for the performance of the municipalities' governmental functions when the same amounts to the taking or damaging of private property for public purposes without first making adequate compensation therefor, or the creation of a nuisance dangerous to the life and health of persons because of its proximity to the people in the enjoyment of the people's property. Greenway v. Thompson, 368 F. Supp. 387 (N.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>This rule cannot be avoided or circumvented</b> by allegations in the nature of conclusions seeking to assert as the basis for municipal liability the act of its placing the active tortfeasor in the position to commit the tort, nor by alleging that in employing the tortfeasor and retaining the tortfeasor on the payroll the municipality was guilty of maintaining a nuisance when the facts otherwise alleged affirmatively show that the real asserted basis of liability is on the theory of respondeat superior. City of Cumming v. Chastain, 97 Ga. App. 13, 102 S.E.2d 97 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability of waiver of immunity provisions.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-3 provides immunity only to governmental entities; consequently, it is a governmental immunity statute and is subject to the waiver of immunity provision of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 33-24-51(b). Ekarika v. City of East Point, 204 Ga. App. 731, 420 S.E.2d 391 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipality can waive governmental immunity.</b> - In a negligence action against a city by plaintiffs injured in a collision with an on-duty police officer, the city's purchase of a general liability insurance policy covering claims in excess of $250,000 waived the city's sovereign immunity to the limits of the policy; since the city did not have a self-insurance plan, participate in any sort of insurance fund or pool, or set aside funds for the payment of liability claims, plaintiffs could recover only damages exceeding the $250,000 threshold. McLemore v. City Council, 212 Ga. 862, 443 S.E.2d 505 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>In the absence of waiver</b> of the immunity afforded by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-3, there can be no municipal liability for a claim based on allegedly reckless conduct by police.

<p class="p6"><b>City cannot ratify.</b> - Municipality cannot ratify the unlawful acts of the municipality's subordinate officials done in the pursuance of the municipality's governmental functions. Davis v. City of Rome, 23 Ga. App. 188, 98 S.E. 231 (1919).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Federal civil rights actions.</b> - Supremacy clause of U.S. Const. prevents state court from construing federal rule to permit state immunity defense to claim made under 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1983, the Civil Rights Act of 1871. Davis v. City of Roswell, 250 Ga. 8, 295 S.E.2d 317 (1982), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S. Ct. 1640, 90 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When a governing body has worked constitutional deprivation of a citizen pursuant to an impermissible or corrupt policy which is intentional and deliberate, a cause of action is accrued under the federal Civil Rights Act in spite of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. City of Cave Spring v. Mason, 252 Ga. 3, 310 S.E.2d 892 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Acts of mayor in setting bond.</b> - City is not liable in damages because the city's mayor required of a person charged with a violation of a city ordinance, a larger bond for the person's appearance than the law authorized, even if the failure of such person to give bond and the person's consequent confinement were occasioned thereby. Gray v. Mayor of Griffin, 111 Ga. 361, 36 S.E. 792 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Wrongful refusal of bail.</b> - City was not liable in damages because mayor, as judge of city's court for the trial of ordinance violations, wrongfully refused to allow bail to an alleged offender and wrongfully directed a police officer to commit the offender to jail, since the offender was imprisoned until released by a habeas corpus proceeding, nor did the appearance of the mayor or an attorney for the municipality in resistance of the habeas corpus constitute a ratification by the municipality of these alleged illegal acts by the municipality's officers, so as to render the municipality liable therefore. Brown v. City of Union Point, 52 Ga. App. 212, 183 S.E. 78 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to provide police protection.</b> - When a failure to provide police protection is alleged, there can only be no liability based on a municipality's duty to protect the general public. However, when there is a special relationship between the individual<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the municipality which sets the individual apart from the general public and engenders a special duty owed to that individual, the municipality may be subject to liability for the nonfeasance of the municipality's police department.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Acts of police officers.</b> - When a police officer was acting as an officer of the city at the time of a homicide, the city would not be liable for the reason that the police officer was in the discharge of a governmental function, and in such case recovery cannot be had against the city. Pounds v. Central of Ga. Ry., 142 Ga. 415, 83 S.E. 96 (1914). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Doctrine of governmental immunity protected the city from liability for the actions of the city's employees, including the police officer who arrested the individual for criminal trespass in the discharge of the officer's lawful duties, and, thus, the city was protected by that immunity from the arrested individual's claims against the city.

<p class="p6">In a tort action for personal injuries and property damage arising from an auto collision filed against a city and the city's police officer, the trial court erred in granting a city summary judgment as: (1) O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-6(d)(2) did not apply; and (2) the city waived the city's sovereign immunity to the extent that the city purchased liability coverage to cover the officer's actions in operating that officer's police car. But, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the officer, given that the officer was engaged in a discretionary function of responding to an emergency situation at the time the accident at issue occurred. Weaver v. City of Statesboro, 288 Ga. App. 32, 653 S.E.2d 765 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0421, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 221 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>There are two conditions for the liability of commissions under this section,</b> namely for the defendants to have acted contrary to a nondiscretionary, ministerial duty, and to have acted with malice. City of Hawkinsville v. Wilson &amp; Wilson, Inc., 231 Ga. 110, 200 S.E.2d 262 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Davis v. Johnson, 92 Ga. App. 858, 90 S.E.2d 426 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Malice defined.</b> - Malice may consist in a general disregard of the right consideration of mankind, directed by chance against the individual injured. Kitchens v. Jefferson County, 85 Ga. App. 902, 70 S.E.2d 527 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Special damages required</b> - When plaintiff city council member failed to plead special damages in action against city manager and mayor's secretary for invasion of privacy based on taping of plaintiff's phone conversation with mayor, plaintiff failed to establish that plaintiff was entitled to proceed under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-4.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>General damages recoverable.</b> - Claim under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-4 is essentially a tort action, not one based on a regulatory restriction; thus, general as well as compensatory damages may be recovered. City of Buford v. Ward, 212 Ga. App. 752, 443 S.E.2d 279 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Claim based on actions taken without authority of law.</b> - Plaintiff businessman, who was refused a certificate of occupancy for a garden center based on the inadequacy of a deceleration/acceleration lane, proved a cause of action against city officials under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-4 since the policy regarding construction of the lane was not based on an ordinance setting forth guidelines or specific factors sufficient to apprise citizens of what to expect and, thus, actions taken pursuant to such policy were without authority of law; further, plaintiff's testimony that plaintiff expended $2,800 to extend the lane beyond the length required for DOT approval was sufficient to show special damages.

<p class="p6">Trial court erred in finding that a mayor was entitled to official immunity in city employees' action for wrongful termination because a question of fact remained as to whether the mayor acted without authority of law by failing to comply with the city's resolution requiring the mayor to get city council approval prior to any termination.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Immunity from liability.</b> - Public official who fails to perform purely ministerial duties required by law is subject to an action for damages by one who is injured by the official's omission; however, when an officer is invested with discretion and is empowered to exercise the officer's judgment in matters brought before the officer, the officer is sometimes called a quasi-judicial officer, and when so acting the officer is usually given immunity from liability to persons who may be injured as a result of an erroneous decision, provided the acts complained of are done within the scope of the officer's authority, and without wilfulness, malice, or corruption. McDay v. City of Atlanta, 204 Ga. App. 621, 420 S.E.2d 75, cert. denied, 204 Ga. App. 922, 420 S.E.2d 75 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

IX(d) and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-4 since: (1) the city finance director did not show that a statement the city manager made to the media regarding the city manager's concerns in the city finance director's department was outside the scope of the city manager's authority; (2) the city manager did not disclose anything to the city finance director's prospective employer that the prospective employer did not obtain through a Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-18-70 et seq., request; and (3) there was no policy that prohibited the city manager from verbally responding in conjunction with the city manager's Open Records Act response. Smith v. Lott, 317 Ga. App. 37, 730 S.E.2d 663 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Appellate court erred by affirming the grant of the individual defendants' motion to dismiss in a personal injury suit involving a pedestrian falling at a high school because whether official immunity barred the action was a fact-specific inquiry that had not been definitively answered since limited discovery had been undertaken. Austin v. Clark, 294 Ga. 773, 755 S.E.2d 796 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Trial court properly granted summary judgment to the mayor and the council member defendants based on governmental liability because the remedies provided under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-4 could not be judicially grafted onto the Whistleblower Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-1-4, which does not mention that code section, nor provides for individual liability.

<p class="p6"><b>Individual not liable if sued in official capacity.</b> - Notwithstanding the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-4, a drinking water commissioner could not be held personally liable for requiring a water customer to extend a water main because the commissioner was not sued in the commissioner's individual capacity. The city could be held liable for the commissioner's actions because, although the actions were unauthorized, the actions were within the scope of the commissioner's employment. City of Atlanta v. Harbor Grove Apts., LLC, 308 Ga. App. 57, 706 S.E.2d 722 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Evidence insufficient to lift immunity.</b> - Trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of police chief when the record was devoid of any conduct by the chief which could remotely be construed as being sufficient to lift the shield that protects public officers acting colore officii; therefore the plaintiff was not allowed to recover for the plaintiff's spouse's suicide while in police custody. McDay v. City of Atlanta, 204 Ga. App. 621, 420 S.E.2d 75, cert. denied, 204 Ga. App. 922, 420 S.E.2d 75 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Nonliability for abatement of nuisance.</b> - When the council of a municipal corporation, in the exercise of the municipality's police powers, and after due notice, declare a building to be a nuisance, and require the building to be torn down, the council would not be liable as individuals to the owner for damages, unless the council acted maliciously, oppressively, corruptly, or without authority of law.

<p class="p6"><b>Claim of nuisance created by failure to maintain and repair sewer lines.</b> - Plaintiff's assertion that the failure of the city to properly maintain and identify the repairs needed on the sewer lines was a nuisance did not give rise to a right of action in nuisance as to plaintiffs.

<p class="p6"><b>This section is in derogation of the common law</b> and should be strictly construed as against the municipality. Maryon v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Purpose and intent</b> of the legislature in the adoption of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 was fourfold: (1) to afford the officials of an offending city opportunity to investigate the complaint at a time when the evidence relative thereto is calculated to be more readily available; (2) to afford the officials an opportunity, if the complaint relates to a continuing nuisance, to take proper steps to abate the nuisance before the effects thereof become great or far-reaching; (3) to bar a claimant's right of recovery for any and all claims arising by reasons of matters that may have transpired or existed giving rise to a cause of action on dates more than six months prior to the giving of the required ante litem notice; and (4) to afford the city an opportunity to negotiate a settlement of such claims as the city may determine to be meritorious before litigation is commenced, thus protecting the interests of the general public by reducing the exposure of the funds in the city treasury to depletion from growing claims for damages. City of Gainesville v. Moss, 108 Ga. App. 713, 134 S.E.2d 547 (1963), overruled on other grounds, City of Chamblee v. Maxwell, 264 Ga. 635, 452 S.E.2d 488 (1994); Robinette v. Johnston, 637 F. Supp. 922 (M.D. Ga. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice requirement is a statute of limitations,</b> and satisfaction of the requirement is a condition precedent to maintaining a lawsuit on a claim against a municipality. Everett v. Napper, 632 F. Supp. 1481 (N.D. Ga. 1986), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 833 F.2d 1507 (11th Cir. 1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability to whistleblower claims.</b> - Like other statutes of limitations, this statute of limitations does not begin to run in the case of continuing torts until the injury is discovered; therefore, former jail inmates' suit against a town for compelling the inmates, while incarcerated, to perform clean-up work on a contaminated building was not time-barred. City of Forsyth v. Bell, 258 Ga. App. 331, 574 S.E.2d 331 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">City employee who filed suit under the Georgia Whistleblower Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-1-4, seeking money damages, among other remedies, was not required to provide written notice of the employee's claim within six months of the alleged retaliation under the municipal ante litem notice statute, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5, because the claim was not a negligence claim. West v. City of Albany, 300 Ga. 743, 797 S.E.2d 809 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Use of summary judgment.</b> - When property owners assert claims against a municipality, flexibility by the court is required in determining whether compliance with the ante litem notice requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 is properly considered a matter in abatement which must be raised in a motion to dismiss under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-12; accordingly, consideration of the matter within the summary judgment context, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56, was proper because matters outside of the pleadings, including the owners' depositions, were considered. Davis v. City of Forsyth, 275 Ga. App. 747, 621 S.E.2d 495 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Purpose of notice requirement</b> is to apprise city of claim in order that the city may determine whether or not to adjust the claim without suit. Tanner v. City of Gainesville, 162 Ga. App. 405, 290 S.E.2d 541 (1982); Jones v. City of Austell, 166 Ga. App. 808, 305 S.E.2d 653 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice not protected First Amendment speech.</b> - Plaintiff's ante litem notice against the city did not constitute speech protected by the First Amendment. Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522 (11th Cir. 1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Claim for attorney fees and costs.</b> - Plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 precluded the plaintiff's ability to sue for money damages in the form of attorney fees and costs of litigation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11. Dover v. City of Jackson, 246 Ga. App. 524, 541 S.E.2d 92 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Firefighters' request for costs of litigation, including attorney fees, was properly submitted to the jury in the firefighters' class action, challenging a promotional examination, as the firefighters were not statutorily required to give ante-litem notice to the city. City of Atlanta v. Bennett, 322 Ga. App. 726, 746 S.E.2d 198 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Doss v. Long, 93 F.R.D. 112 (N.D. Ga. 1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 provides that ante litem notice be given the city as a condition precedent to suit against the city. Jones v. City of Austell, 166 Ga. App. 808, 305 S.E.2d 653 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of failure to comply.</b> - Failure to comply with the provisions of this law within the time required thereby is a bar to any right of action against a municipality, and the giving of such notice is a condition precedent to the bringing of any action against a municipality. City of Atlanta v. Barrett, 102 Ga. App. 469, 116 S.E.2d 654 (1960); City of Gainesville v. Moss, 108 Ga. App. 713, 134 S.E.2d 547 (1963), overruled on other grounds, City of Chamblee v. Maxwell, 264 Ga. 635, 452 S.E.2d 488 (1994); Stambaugh v. City of Demorest, 221 Ga. 527, 145 S.E.2d 539 (1965); City of Atlanta v. Frank, 120 Ga. App. 273, 170 S.E.2d 265 (1969); Schaefer v.

City of Manchester, 246 Ga. App. 129, 539 S.E.2d 845 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of section as conferring immunity.</b> - Before the enactment of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-308 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5) requiring a demand, the liability of every municipal corporation in Georgia, under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-301 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-1), was unqualified and unconditional. By the enactment of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-308 the unqualified liability of each municipal corporation became conditional upon the demand required by the statute. City of Atlanta v. Hudgins, 193 Ga. 618, 19 S.E.2d 508 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applies only against municipal corporations.</b> - By its plain terms, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5(d) applies only against municipal corporations, whether under the Georgia Tort Claims Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-21-20 et seq., or otherwise.

<p class="p6"><b>Absolute exactness of notice not necessary.</b> - When the notice states the time, place, manner, circumstances, and details of the accident causing the injuries for which the claim was made and the acts of negligence charged against the municipality as well as the amount claimed as damages, this is a sufficient compliance with the statute, and the fact that the claim filed with the municipality states that the plaintiffs claimed "35,000 from said municipality," and the action was filed jointly against the municipality and an individual is immaterial.

<p class="p6"><b>Notice need not be as clear and specific as petition.</b> - It would be entirely contrary to the purpose of this section to say that the negligence relied on must be as clearly and specifically set forth in the notice as in the petition; the object and purpose of the notice is merely to give the city an opportunity to investigate the matter in order to determine whether the city will pay without suit.

<p class="p6">In the plaintiff's action for damages against the city and two of the city's employees after one of the city's firefighters was involved in a motor vehicle collision with the plaintiff, the trial court properly denied the city's motion to dismiss because the plaintiff's ante litem notice satisfied the plain language and purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5(e) as the notice stated that the plaintiff would seek to recover $1,000,000 in monetary damages, and that was a specific amount of monetary damages that could constitute an offer of compromise.

<p class="p6"><b>Reply to plaintiff's claim acts as estoppel to assert defects in notice.</b> - When neither the pleadings nor the evidence reveals the slightest suggestion of restrictions on counsel for the city, the presumption arises that the city attorney had authority to bind the client by the solemn acknowledgment to plaintiff after receipt of plaintiff's letter giving notice of plaintiff's injury that, after investigation, the conclusion had been reached that the city was not liable. This amounts to an acknowledgment that this section had been complied with and the ante litem notice was sufficient, clearing the way for the filing of the complaint and estopping the city to deny the validity of the notice.

<p class="p6"><b>Evidence stricken when insufficient to show waiver or estoppel.</b> - When allegations that the matter of plaintiff's injury was referred to a liability insurance carrier for investigation and settlement are insufficient to show waiver or any basis for estoppel, the allegations are improper in the pleadings of a tort action because the allegations are irrelevant to the issue and the allegations are properly stricken on motion.

<p class="p6"><b>Municipality may answer claim after period elapsed.</b> - Length of time in which to consider and act upon a claim against a municipal corporation under this section has reference to consideration and action by public officers as affecting the public interest. It is not declared that the governing authority may not consider and act upon the claim after 30 days have elapsed. It could be to the public interest to have longer than 30 days. The object is to facilitate adjustment without suit, and there is no express withdrawal of power to consider and act. Thus, the quoted part of the first proviso of this section is merely directory, and not a limitation of authority. City of Rome v.

<p class="p6"><b>Mental and physical incapacitation tolls statute.</b> - When a person has a cause of action for personal injuries against a municipal corporation for which, as a condition precedent to its enforcement, the person is required to give the statutory notice provided for in this section, and where, as a result of the occurrence giving rise to the cause of action, such person becomes mentally and physically incapacitated so as to be incapable of acting individually in carrying on the person's business and in prosecuting the person's claim, the time limit for giving the statutory notice of the person's claim is tolled until such time as the person regains the capacity to act individually or until such time as a guardian is appointed and actually does act for the person, or until such time as one bona fide acting for the person as next friend actually gives the defendant municipality such notice. When a suit is brought thereafter by such next friend during the continuing disability of the plaintiff showing a notice given to the defendant more than 30 days prior to the filing thereof it is not subject to general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) on the ground that such notice was not timely given.

<p class="p6"><b>Plaintiff waiting past expiration of 30-day period protected.</b> - When a plaintiff, though having the right to sue immediately after the expiration of the 30-day period, nevertheless waits longer pending action on the demand by the municipal authorities, the plaintiff does so by permission of the law as well as under guaranty of the law that so long as the claim was pending without action the statute would not run against the plaintiff. It necessarily follows that this case is not to be governed by the general rule as to computing the limitation period from the time the cause of action accrues, but that it is governed by the exception found in the second proviso to this section, so far as it relates to the statute of limitations.

<p class="p6"><b>Tolling of claims against municipal corporations.</b> - In a tort action brought by a passenger against a regional transportation authority, the reversal of the denial of the authority's motion for judgment on the pleadings was upheld because by its terms, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5(d) permitted the tolling of the period of limitation only for claims against municipal corporations and it was not a municipal corporation.

<p class="p6"><b>Case of continuing nuisance.</b> - Notice to a city alleged to have been given within six months from the expiration of the four-year statute of limitations period during which the nuisance sued on continuously caused damage to the petitioner's property was given within the time prescribed by this section. Vickers v. City of Fitzgerald, 216 Ga. 476, 117 S.E.2d 316 (1960), overruled on other grounds, City of Chamblee v.

The recovery of any damages incurred prior thereto would be barred, since no timely notice of claim therefor was given pursuant to this section; overruling Vickers v. City of Fitzgerald, 216 Ga. 476, 117 S.E.2d 316 (1960); City of Gainesville v. Moss, 108 Ga. App. 713(2), 134 S.E.2d 547 (1963). City of Chamblee v.

<p class="p6">When a property owner failed to give any written notice to a city prior to filing a complaint for continuing trespass, summary judgment in favor of the city was proper as to the owner's claim for damages resulting from any continuing trespass "event" which occurred more than six months prior to the filing of the complaint. Any claim for damages resulting from a continuing trespass "event" which occurred within six months of the filing of the complaint was subject to a plea in abatement, rather than a motion seeking substantive adjudication.

<p class="p6">Trial court properly granted summary judgment to the city on the claimant's tort claims arising from the back up of a sewer that flooded the claimant's home as no genuine dispute existed that the claimant did not file a written ante litem notice with the city within six months of the happening of the event that gave rise to the claim, the first flooding. The claimant was required to file written notice within that time even though the claimant alleged the flooding was a continuing nuisance as the city was entitled to notice arising from the first flooding so the city could attempt to fix the problem and the claimant's failure to timely give the city written notice meant the city could not be held liable.

<p class="p9"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Procedure</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Necessity of alleging timely notice.</b> - An action for damages for personal injuries against a municipality which fails to allege that the plaintiff's claim has been presented in writing to the municipality within six months of the occurrence of the injury is subject to general demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Jones v. City Council, 100 Ga. App. 268, 110 S.E.2d 691 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">That part of the holding in Dover v. City of Jackson, 246 Ga. App. 524 (2000), requiring an ante litem notice for a statutory claim for attorney fees and costs of litigation is overruled because it is contrary to the specific statutory language, which limits its applicability to claims brought "on account of injuries to person or property"; the holding also ignores the courts' duty to strictly construe the statute because it is in derogation of common law. Greater Atlanta Home Builders Ass'n, Inc. v. City of McDonough, 322 Ga. App. 627, 745 S.E.2d 830 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Substantial compliance must be alleged.</b> - In a claim for money damages against a municipal corporation on account of injuries to person or property, the petition must affirmatively allege a compliance with the provisions of this section and unless it does so, it should be dismissed on demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Saunders v. City of Fitzgerald, 113 Ga. 619, 38 S.E. 978 (1901); Hooper v. City of Atlanta, 26 Ga. App. 221, 105 S.E. 723 (1921); Grooms v. City of Hawkinsville, 31 Ga. App. 424, 120 S.E. 807 (1923); Newton v. City of Moultrie, 37 Ga. App. 631, 141 S.E. 322 (1928). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">While giving of notice is a condition precedent to bringing an action, the giving of such notice is at once part and parcel of the enforcement of the right and it is an inseparable part of the bringing of the action. It is a part of the procedure for enforcing the right and as such it must affirmatively appear in the petition, either in the body thereof or by an exhibit thereto that such notice has been given. A petition which does not thus affirmatively show performance of the condition precedent is subject to general demurrer (now motion to dismiss). City of Atlanta v. Barrett, 102 Ga. App. 469, 116 S.E.2d 654 (1960); Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. R.D.C., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 1163 (N.D. Ga. 1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Compliance with this section must be alleged in the complaint</b> or else the complaint cannot state a cause of action. City of Atlanta v. Frank, 120 Ga. App. 273, 170 S.E.2d 265 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Allegations of compliance are not subject to demurrer</b> (now motion to dismiss) merely because no copy of a claim was attached to the petition. Habersham County v. Cornwall, 38 Ga. App. 419, 144 S.E. 55 (1928).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When no allegation in complaint that notice given to city, claim not maintainable.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 requires written notice of the charges to the municipal corporation. When a complaint does not make any allegation that written notice was given to a city, no claim based on state law can be maintained against the city. Dague v. Riverdale Athletic Ass'n, 99 F.R.D. 325 (N.D. Ga. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of allegation of notice in renewal petition.</b> - An allegation in the renewal petition to the effect that prior to the institution of the former suit, which was against a municipal corporation, the plaintiff had served upon the defendant a written notice of claim, as provided by this section, in which the plaintiff claimed damages arising out of the same cause of action as that sued on in the renewal petition, is not an allegation as to the cause of action sued on in the former suit. Barber v. City of Rome, 39 Ga. App. 225, 146 S.E. 856 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Giving of notice is part of trial process.</b> City of Atlanta v. Frank, 120 Ga. App. 273, 170 S.E.2d 265 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Stipulation as to receiving notice.</b> - In a nuisance suit by homeowners against the City of Atlanta with regard to recurrent flooding in a neighborhood, the trial court erred in granting the city's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to one homeowner based on the homeowners' alleged failure to put forth any evidence that those homeowners served the city with the statutorily required ante litem notice; because the record demonstrated that the city stipulated that one of the homeowners had provided ante litem notice, the trial court erred in granting a judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to that homeowner, but since there was no citation in the record as to the other homeowner providing ante litem notice to the city, granting of the city's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to that homeowner was proper. City of Atlanta v. Broadnax, 285 Ga. App. 430, 646 S.E.2d 279 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1445, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 615, 648 (Ga. 2007), overruled on other grounds, Royal Capital Dev. LLC v. Md. Cas. Co., 291 Ga. 262, 728 S.E.2d 234 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to rebut allegation of notice in amended complaint.</b> - When plaintiff, in plaintiff's amended complaint, alleged plaintiff gave the ante litem notice required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5, but the defendants failed to rebut the allegation in the amended complaint, the dismissal of the complaint under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 was improper. Harper v. Savannah Police Dep't, 179 Ga. App. 449, 346 S.E.2d 891 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipality required to consider claim.</b> - After plaintiffs furnish a sufficient ante litem notice, the municipality is required to consider and act on the claim by settlement or denial. City of Claxton v. Claxton Poultry Co., 134 Ga. App. 679, 215 S.E.2d 718 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Evasive answer treated as admission.</b> - Petition alleged that notice of claim for damages was given to the defendant municipal corporation. The defendant being chargeable with knowledge of the service upon it of this notice, and its answer to this allegation of the petition being evasive, the answer will be treated as an admission that the notice was given as alleged. Mayor of Madison v. Bearden, 22 Ga. App. 376, 96 S.E. 572, cert. denied, 22 Ga. App. 803 (1918).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Availability of discovery.</b> - Further discovery procedures are available to the city on the same basis offered by law to parties in all litigation proceedings. City of Claxton v. Claxton Poultry Co., 134 Ga. App. 679, 215 S.E.2d 718 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipality may not demand additional information or hearing.</b> - There is no requirement contemplated by the statute that after receipt of a notice of claim the municipality may require additional information, or that the city may demand that the complainant appear before the city's council for an informational hearing. City of Claxton v. Claxton Poultry Co., 134 Ga. App. 679, 215 S.E.2d 718 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Compliance with section must be proven.</b> - When, in an action for personal injuries against a city, compliance with this section is alleged, and such allegation is denied by the city, it is a necessary part of the plaintiff's case that plaintiff prove compliance with the statute, and on failure to show substantial compliance therewith it is not error to grant a nonsuit. City of Tallapoosa v. Brock, 138 Ga. 622, 75 S.E. 644 (1912); Bostwick v. City of Griffin, 141 Ga. 120, 80 S.E. 657 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When the trial record did not clearly establish that six-months' ante litem notice was not given,</b> it was error to dismiss the claim against the municipal corporation. Brackett v. City of Atlanta, 149 Ga. App. 147, 253 S.E.2d 786 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Plaintiff bound by acts alleged in notice.</b> - Petition on which the plaintiff seeks recovery against the city must be based on the claimed negligent transaction as set out in the notice given to the city, and plaintiff cannot proceed against the city upon acts of negligence different from those set out in that notice. City of Atlanta v. Harris, 52 Ga. App. 56, 182 S.E. 202 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Plaintiff's action for malicious prosecution was premature,</b> as was plaintiff's ante litem notice to the defendant municipality, when plaintiff's indictment for theft of services had been dead-docketed, since termination of that prosecution in plaintiff's favor was a prerequisite to bringing of a malicious prosecution suit and dead-docketing of a case does not terminate a malicious prosecution case. Webster v. City of E. Point, 164 Ga. App. 605, 294 S.E.2d 588 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Premature suit grounds for abatement, not summary judgment.</b> - Compliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 is a condition precedent to filing suit against the city, but the filing of suit against the city prior to the expiration of 30 days from the time of filing the claim is a matter that is properly raised as a plea in abatement and not a proper subject for summary judgment. Jones v. City of Austell, 166 Ga. App. 808, 305 S.E.2d 653 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Dismissal, rather than summary judgment,</b> is appropriate in cases when the merits cannot be reached because of the plaintiff's failure to satisfy the notice requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5. Robinette v. Johnston, 637 F. Supp. 922 (M.D. Ga. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Dismissal of premature suit is without prejudice.</b> - In cases in which the merits could not have been reached because of the failure of the plaintiff to satisfy a precondition, such as when a suit is filed prior to the expiration of 30 days from the time of filing the claim, the appropriate action is dismissal of the case on motion. Such a dismissal should be without prejudice, and, having no res judicata effect, would not bar the filing of another suit. Jones v. City of Austell, 166 Ga. App. 808, 305 S.E.2d 653 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Complaint properly amended after notice of claim given.</b> - Claim by an association of taxicab owners that a city violated procedural due process by failing to provide the association's members with proper notice of violations of regulations was improperly dismissed for failure to comply with the ante-litem notice requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5 when the association failed to give notice of the claim before filing the association's original complaint, withdrew the claim from the complaint, gave notice under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-33-5, and then amended the original complaint to add the claim; the notification could not have been accomplished simply by amending the complaint after the action was filed, and to the extent that City of Atlanta v. Fuller, 164 S.E.2d 364 (1968) held otherwise, that case was overruled, but the procedure followed by the association satisfied the procedural requirement of giving the city an opportunity to investigate the claim so as to determine whether to settle the claim without resorting to litigation, and the association was not procedurally barred from pursuing the association's claim for the alleged due process violations that occurred in the six months before the ante-litem notice was given. Atlanta Taxicab Co. Owners Ass'n v. City of Atlanta, 281 Ga. 342, 638 S.E.2d 307 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of nonsuit on proof of notice.</b> - In an action against a municipality for personal injuries, duly renewed after the grant of a nonsuit in a substantially similar former action in the superior court, the former judgment cannot be taken as having determined that the petition was insufficient, and that the plaintiff had no right to recover, because plaintiff's notice of injury to the municipality was legally insufficient under this section, especially since it is not made to appear that the sufficiency of the notice was in anywise determined or questioned in the former action by demurrer (now motion to dismiss) or otherwise, or that the nonsuit was granted for any reason other than that the evidence as to negligence was insufficient to authorize a recovery. Jones v. Mayor of Savannah, 52 Ga. App. 537, 184 S.E. 353 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Powers and authority of mayor and aldermen derived from city charter.</b> - Legislature has not enacted general laws giving any general powers to either mayors or aldermen of municipal corporations.

<p class="p6"><b>Electric company must show right to erect poles in land of highway.</b> - To justify setting up the company's poles in the land of a highway, a company which uses poles and wires in the transmission of electric currents must show that the company has acquired the right to do so, either by consent or condemnation from the owner of the soil. The designation by the municipality of the street where the poles may be set up is not enough. Donalson v.

<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality of different rates for those residing outside corporate limits.</b> - Plaintiffs, having no right to demand water service from the city, may purchase the water at the city's charge therefor, or plaintiffs may decline to do so, at plaintiffs' will, but the plaintiffs are in no position which authorizes the plaintiffs to complain of an excessive charge or a discriminating rate. Hence, there was no merit in the contention that the city's ordinances which fixed different water rates for those who resided outside of the city's corporate limits offended U.S. Const., amend. 14, or Ga.

<p class="p6">Claim of state-action immunity did not entitle a city to dismissal of a suit alleging the city violated the Sherman and Clayton Acts by tying its water-utility service to its natural-gas service for some customers because Georgia's policy to displace federal antitrust law as to municipal anticompetitive conduct in providing water and sewage services does not have as an inherent, logical, or ordinary result that cities would use their water monopoly to increase their share of an unrelated market.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The governing authority of each municipal corporation shall have legislative power to adopt clearly reasonable ordinances, resolutions, or regulations relating to its property, affairs, and local government for which no provision has been made by general law and which are not inconsistent with the Constitution or any charter provision applicable thereto. Any such charter provision shall remain in force and effect until amended or repealed as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section. This Code section, however, shall not restrict the authority of the General Assembly, by general law, to define this home rule power further or to broaden, limit, or otherwise regulate the exercise thereof. The General Assembly shall not pass any local law to repeal, modify, or supersede any action taken by a municipal governing authority under this Code section, except as authorized under Code Section 36-35-6. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as provided in Code Section 36-35-6, a municipal corporation may, as an incident of its home rule power, amend its charter by following either of the following procedures: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(1) Municipal charters may be amended by ordinances duly adopted at two regular consecutive meetings of the municipal governing authority, not less than seven nor more than 60 days apart. A notice containing a synopsis of the proposed amendment shall be published in the official organ of the county of the legal situs of the municipal corporation or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipal corporation once a week for three weeks within a period of 60 days immediately preceding its final adoption. The notice shall state that a copy of the proposed amendment is on file in the office of the clerk or the recording officer of the municipal governing authority and in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county of the legal situs of the municipal corporation for the purpose of examination and inspection by the public. The recording officer of the municipal governing authority shall furnish anyone, upon written request, a copy of the proposed amendment. No amendment under this paragraph shall be valid to change or repeal an amendment adopted pursuant to a referendum as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection or to change or repeal a local Act of the General Assembly ratified in a referendum as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection or to change or repeal a local Act of the General Assembly ratified in a referendum by the electors of the municipal corporation unless at least 12 months have elapsed after such referendums. No amendment under this paragraph shall be valid if provision has been made therefor by general law; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) (A) Amendments to charters or amendments to or repeals of ordinances, resolutions, or regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section may be initiated by a petition, filed with the governing authority of the municipal corporation, containing, in cases of municipal corporations with a population of 5,000 or less, the signatures of at least 25 percent of the electors registered to vote in the last general municipal election; in cases of municipal corporations with a population of more than 5,000 but not more than 100,000, at least 20 percent of the electors registered to vote in the last general municipal election; and in cases of municipal corporations with a population of more than 100,000, at least 15 percent of the electors registered to vote in the last general municipal election. The petition shall specifically set forth the exact language of the proposed amendment or repeal. The governing authority shall determine the validity of such petition within 50 days of its filing with the governing authority. In the event that the governing authority determines that such petition is valid, it shall be the duty of such authority to issue the call for an election for the purpose of submitting such amendment or repeal to the registered electors of the municipal corporation for their approval or rejection. Such call shall be issued within one week after the determination of the validity of the petition. The governing authority shall set the date of the election as provided in Code Section 21-2-540. The governing authority shall cause a notice of the date of the election to be published in the official organ of the county of the legal situs of the municipal corporation or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipal corporation once a week for two weeks immediately preceding such date. The notice shall also contain a synopsis of the proposed amendment or repeal and shall state that a copy thereof is on file in the office of the clerk or the recording officer of the municipal governing authority and in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county of the legal situs of the municipal corporation, for the purpose of examination and inspection by the public. The recording officer of the municipal governing authority shall furnish anyone, upon written request, a copy of the proposed amendment. If more than one-half of the votes cast on the question are for approval of the amendment or the repeal, the same shall become of full force and effect; otherwise it shall be void and of no force and effect. The expense of the election shall be borne by the municipal corporation. It shall be the duty of the governing authority to hold and conduct such election. The election shall be held under the same laws and rules and regulations as govern special elections of the municipal corporation, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph. It shall be the duty of the governing authority to canvass the returns and to declare and certify the result of the election. It shall be the further duty of the governing authority to certify the result thereof to the Secretary of State. A referendum on any such amendment or repeal shall not be held more often than once each year. No amendment under this subparagraph shall be valid if provision has been made therefor by general law. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) In the event that the governing authority determines that the petition is not valid, it shall publish in explicit detail the reasons why such petition is not valid. Such publication shall be in the official organ of the county of the legal situs of the municipal corporation or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipal corporation, in the week immediately following the date on which the petition is declared to be not valid. In any proceeding in which the validity of the petition is at issue, the tribunal considering such issue shall not be limited by the reasons assigned. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) The sponsor of a petition authorized by this paragraph shall obtain copies of all official petitions from the clerk of the governing authority. The clerk of the governing authority shall approve all petitions as to form. The clerk of the governing authority shall provide a place on each form for the person collecting signatures to provide his or her name, street address, city, county, state, ZIP Code, and telephone number and to swear that he or she is a resident of the municipality affected by the petition and that the signatures were collected inside the boundaries of the affected municipality. The collection of signatures for the petition shall begin on the day the clerk of the governing authority provides official copies to the sponsor of the petition. A petition authorized by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be accepted by the governing authority for verification if more than 60 days have elapsed since the date the sponsor of the petition first obtained copies of the petition from the clerk of the governing authority. Any petition being circulated pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph on July 1, 1989, shall be filed with the clerk of the governing authority by not later than July 11, 1989. The clerk of the governing authority shall, within seven days, provide the sponsor with official petitions. The sponsor shall have 60 additional days after obtaining official petitions to collect the remaining number of required signatures. Nothing in this subparagraph shall invalidate otherwise valid signatures collected on or before July 1, 1989. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Existence of police power dependent on express grant by state.</b> - Police power, while it is an attribute of sovereignty and an inherent power of national and state government because the existence of government as well as the social order, security, life, and health of the individual citizen depend upon it, is a power possessed by municipal corporations only if, where, and to the extent there has been an express grant by the state.

<p class="p6"><b>Authority to enact new charters including drastic changes in city government reserved in General Assembly.</b> - The General Assembly has reserved the legislative power to enact new charters for existing cities when such charters include drastic changes in the composition and form of city government, and the election and terms of office of the members of the governing authority of cities. Bruck v. City of Temple, 240 Ga. 411, 240 S.E.2d 876 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Authority to adopt ordinance amending city charter.</b> - Authority of a municipality to adopt an ordinance amending its city charter cannot be derived from subsection (a), which prohibits the enactment of local ordinances inconsistent with municipal charter provisions. The ordinance must be adopted pursuant to the procedures set out in subsection (b), which establishes one of two methods through which a municipality may amend a municipality's charter without the intervention of the General Assembly.

<p class="p6"><b>Ordinance prohibiting blowing of train whistle.</b> - Municipal ordinance providing without exception that no person operating a locomotive engine shall blow the whistle thereof within the corporate limits of a city is void as being unreasonable, contrary to public interest, public policy, and the general welfare of the public, when it appears without dispute that the ordinance's application at certain grade crossings within the city would prohibit the operator of a locomotive engine from giving adequate warning to persons who may be in, near, or about to enter a place of danger upon the tracks where the locomotive engine is operating.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The governing authority of each municipal corporation is authorized to fix the salary, compensation, and expenses of its municipal employees and the members of its municipal governing authority and to provide insurance, retirement, and pension benefits, coverage under federal old-age, survivors and disability programs, hospitalization benefits, and workers' compensation benefits for its employees, their dependents, and their survivors and for members of the municipal governing authority, their dependents, and their survivors, when such benefits are provided to municipal employees. Any previous actions to extend insurance, federal old-age, survivors and disability programs, retirement, hospitalization, and workers' compensation benefits to members of the municipal governing authority are validated. With the exception of the provision of insurance, federal old-age, survivors and disability programs, retirement, hospitalization, and workers' compensation benefits, any action to increase the salary or compensation of the elective members of the municipal governing authority shall be subject to the following conditions and requirements: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(1) Any such increase shall not be effective until after the taking of office of those elected at the next regular municipal election which is held immediately following the date on which the action to increase the compensation was taken; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Such action shall not be taken during the period of time beginning with the date that candidates for election to membership on the municipal governing authority may first qualify as such candidates and ending with the date members of the municipal governing authority take office following their election; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) Such action shall not be taken until notice of intent to take the action has been published in a newspaper of general circulation designated as the legal organ in the county and in the municipal corporation at least once a week for three consecutive weeks immediately preceding the week during which the action is taken. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As used in subsection (a) of this Code section, the phrase "elective members of the municipal governing authority" means, notwithstanding any terminology or designation of a municipal governing authority or governing body contained in any municipal charter, any elective municipal official who exercises any executive or legislative or executive and legislative powers of the municipal corporation, specifically including a mayor, vice-mayor, president or chairman of a municipal council, member of a municipal council, member of a board of aldermen, or member of a board of commissioners. Such phrase shall also include any person who is appointed to fill a vacancy in any such elective office. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The governing authority of each municipal corporation shall be authorized to provide by ordinance for the reimbursement of such actual and necessary expenses. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The General Assembly declares and affirms that the Act approved April 17, 1981 (Ga. L. 1981, p. 1741) was intended to assure that prior advertisement of actions to provide insurance, federal old-age, survivors and disability programs, retirement, pension, hospitalization, and workers' compensation benefits to elected members of the municipal governing authority, their dependents, and their survivors is not required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Mayor is not member of "municipal governing authority"</b> and, therefore, the authority of the city council to increase the compensation paid to the office of the mayor is not subject to the strictures of this section. Savage v. City of Atlanta, 242 Ga. 671, 251 S.E.2d 268 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Meaning of phrase "governing authority".</b> - Generally accepted meaning of the phrase "governing authority" or "governing body," in reference to the operation of city or county governments, is a council or board performing legislative functions. Savage v. City of Atlanta, 242 Ga. 671, 251 S.E.2d 268 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>In determining whether municipal officer is part of governing authority</b> of municipality, the question is whether that municipal officer possesses legislative power. Savage v. City of Atlanta, 242 Ga. 671, 251 S.E.2d 268 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Fact that mayor of town is presiding officer of council</b> and has power to cast tie-breaking votes does not make the mayor a member of council if the city charter provides that the mayor is not to be a member. Accordingly, even though the president of the city council is the presiding officer of the council and possesses the authority to cast tie-breaking votes, the mayor should not be considered a member of the council, since the city charter expressly provides that the mayor is not to be a member. Therefore, an increase in the mayor's compensation is not subject to this section. Savage v. City of Atlanta, 242 Ga. 671, 251 S.E.2d 268 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>"Retirement benefits" construed.</b> - Benefits provided under a city retirement plan are retirement benefits expressly exempted under subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-35-4 and not in the nature of a pension or gratuity when the retirement plan allows council members, after a given period of time, to terminate employment and receive partial credit for past years' service toward the total required time for entitlement to a monthly payment for life. Swann v. Board of Trustees, 257 Ga. 450, 360 S.E.2d 395 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>City ordinance increasing pension plan contribution rate.</b> - Trial court properly granted the city defendants summary judgment on the city employees' claims of breach of contract and unconstitutional impairment of contract regarding an ordinance increasing their pension plan contribution rate because the Georgia General Assembly expressly contemplated that a municipal corporation's provision for employee retirement or pension benefits would be subject to being supplemented by local law.

</b></p>
<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject to the limitations provided by this Code section, the governing authority of any municipal corporation is authorized to reapportion the election districts from which members of the municipal governing authority are elected following publication of the United States decennial census of 1980 or any future such census. Such reapportionment of districts shall be effective for the election of members to the municipal governing authority at the next regular general municipal election following the publication of the decennial census. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The municipal governing authority shall by ordinance amend its charter pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Code Section 36-35-3 to reapportion the districts in accordance with the following specifications: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(1) Each reapportioned district shall be formed of contiguous territory; and the boundary lines of such district shall be the center lines of streets or other well-defined boundaries; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Variations in population among such districts shall comply with the one person-one vote requirements of the United States Constitution; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) The reapportionment shall be limited to adjusting the boundary lines of the existing districts only to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection; and the number of members of the municipal governing body and the manner of electing such members, except for the adjustment of district boundary lines, shall not be changed by the municipal governing authority. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to reapportionment following publication of the decennial census, a municipal governing authority shall reapportion districts pursuant to this Code section if the annexation of additional territory to the corporate boundaries of the municipality has the effect of denying electors residing within the newly annexed territory the right to vote for members of the municipal governing authority on substantially the same basis as the other electors of the municipality vote for members of the municipal governing authority. The reapportionment provided for in this subsection shall meet the criteria specified in subsection (b) of this Code section and shall be further limited to making only those adjustments in district boundary lines as may be reasonably necessary to include the newly annexed territory within such districts. Reapportionment under this subsection shall be effective for the next regular general municipal election following the annexation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This Code section shall not prohibit the General Assembly from enacting a local law at any time to amend the charter of a municipality to reapportion or otherwise change election districts from which members of the municipal governing authority are elected. If such action is taken by the General Assembly following publication of a decennial census, but before the first regular general municipal election following the publication of such census, the local Act of the General Assembly shall nullify the power given to the municipal governing authority by subsections (a) and (b) of this Code section to reapportion districts following publication of that decennial census. If such action is taken by the General Assembly in conjunction with the annexation, by local Act of the General Assembly, of additional territory to the corporate boundaries of the municipality, the local Act of the General Assembly shall nullify the power and duty given to the municipal governing authority by subsection (c) of this Code section to reapportion districts as a result of that annexation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to reapportionment following publication of the decennial census, the governing authority of any municipal corporation with a population of 40,000 or more according to the latest United States decennial census is authorized not more than one time during the ten-year period between the publication of consecutive decennial censuses to reapportion or modify the election districts from which members of the municipal governing authority are elected; provided, however, that (1) no such reapportionment shall result in the redistricting of more than 600 persons, (2) no such reapportionment shall occur within 180 days of a general or special municipal election or primary, and (3) a map reflecting any changes and copies of any communications to or from the United States Department of Justice relating to such changes are furnished to the Secretary of State and the Legislative Reapportionment Office within 30 days after such change or communication. Such reapportionment of districts shall be effective for the election of one or more members to the municipal governing authority at the next regular general municipal election or special municipal election following such reapportionment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Although the meaning of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 36-35-6 (b) is ambiguous,</b> the statute indicates that the state does not wish to give our cities the power to enact a distinctive law of contract. City of Atlanta v. McKinney, 265 Ga. 161, 454 S.E.2d 517 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Cities without power to adopt new charters changing form of government.</b> - Under Ga. Const. 1945, Art. XV, Sec. I, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. II, Para. II), and this section, cities do not have the power to adopt entirely new charters changing a cities' form of government. Thus, a new charter created by a special law does not contravene Ga. Const. 1945, Art. I, Sec. IV, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec. VI, Para. IV.), which forbids the legislature from adopting a special law covering a subject matter dealt with by an existing general law. Jackson v.

<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality of local law extending municipal boundaries.</b> - Local law extending municipal boundaries does not violate the constitutional guarantee of due process of the law because the law subjects property owners in the area annexed to taxation by the municipality; nor does the law deny to such property owners equal protection of the law within the meaning of U.S. Const., amend. 14.

<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The intent of this Code section is to provide a mechanism to resolve disputes over land use arising out of the rezoning of property to a more intense land use in conjunction with or subsequent to annexation in order to facilitate coordinated planning between counties and municipalities particularly with respect to areas contiguous to municipal boundaries; provided, however, that on and after September 1, 2007, such dispute resolutions shall be governed by the provisions of Article 7 of this chapter and the provisions of this Code section shall be limited to proceedings initiated prior to such date. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As used in this Code section, the term "objection" means an objection to a proposed change in land use which results in a substantial change in the intensity of the allowable use of the property or a change to a significantly different allowable use. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When an initial zoning of property is sought pursuant to subsection (d) of Code Section 36-66-4 or when the rezoning of annexed property is sought within one year of the effective date of the annexation, the municipal corporation shall give notice to the county governing authority within seven calendar days of the filing of the application for initial zoning or rezoning. Upon receipt of such notice, the county governing authority shall have seven calendar days to notify the municipality in writing of its intent to raise an objection to the proposed zoning or rezoning of the property and shall specify the basis for the objection. If the county governing authority serves notice of its intent to object, then the county governing authority shall have ten calendar days from the date of the county's notice to document in writing the nature of the objection specifically identifying the basis for the objection including any increased service delivery or infrastructure costs. The absence of a written notice of intent to object or failure to document the nature of the objection shall mean the municipal corporation may proceed with the zoning or rezoning and no subsequent objections under this process may be filed for the zoning or rezoning under consideration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Commencing with the date of receipt by the municipality of the county's documented objections, representatives of the municipal corporation and the county shall have 21 calendar days to devise mitigating measures to address the county's specific objections to the proposed zoning or rezoning. The governing authority of the municipal corporation and the governing authority of the county may agree on mitigating measures or agree in writing to waive the objections at any time within the 21 calendar day period, in which event the municipal corporation may proceed with the zoning or rezoning in accordance with such agreement; or, where an initial zoning is proposed concurrent with annexation, the municipality may approve, deny, or abandon the annexation of all or parts of the property under review. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) If the representatives of the municipal corporation and the county fail to reach agreement on the objections and mitigating measures within the 21 calendar day period, either the governing authority of the municipal corporation or the governing authority of the county may insist upon appointment of a mediator within seven calendar days after the end of the 21 day period to assist in resolving the dispute. The mediator shall be mutually selected and appointed within seven calendar days of either party's timely, written insistence on a mediator. The party insisting on use of the mediator shall bear two-thirds of the expense of the mediation and the other party shall bear one-third of the expense of the mediation. If both the municipality and the county insist on mediation, the expenses of mediation shall be shared equally. The mediator shall have up to 28 calendar days to meet with the parties to develop alternatives to resolve the objections. If the municipal corporation and the county agree on alternatives to resolve the objections, the municipal corporation may proceed in accordance with the mediated agreement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) If the objections are not resolved by the end of the 28 day period, the municipal governing authority or the county governing authority may, no later than seven calendar days after the conclusion of such 28 day period, request review by a citizen review panel. The citizen review panel shall be an independent body comprised of one resident of the municipal corporation appointed by the municipal governing authority, one resident of the county appointed by the county governing authority, and one nonresident of the county who is a land use planning professional mutually selected by the municipal and county appointees to the citizen review panel. No elected or appointed officials or employees, contractors, or vendors of a municipality or county may serve on the citizen review panel. If a request for review by a citizen review panel is made, the mediator shall make arrangements to appear personally at the first meeting of the panel and brief the panel members regarding the objections and proposed mitigating measures or provide a written presentation of such objections and proposed mitigating measures to the panel members on or before the date of such first meeting, whichever the mediator deems appropriate. The citizen review panel shall meet at least once but may conduct as many meetings as necessary to complete its review within a 21 calendar day period. All meetings of the citizen review panel shall be open to the public pursuant to Chapter 14 of Title 50. Within 21 calendar days of the request for review, the citizen review panel shall complete its review of the evidence submitted by the county and the municipality concerning the objections and proposed mitigating measures and shall issue its own recommendations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(5) The citizen review panel shall recommend approval or denial of the zoning or rezoning and address the objections and proposed mitigating measures. Where an initial zoning is proposed concurrent with annexation, the panel may also recommend that the annexation be approved or abandoned. The findings and recommendations of the citizen review panel shall not be binding. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(6) Following receipt of the recommendations of the citizen review panel, the municipal corporation may: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) Zone or rezone all or parts of the property under review; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) Zone or rezone all or parts of the property under review with mitigating measures; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p11">Where an initial zoning is proposed concurrent with annexation, the municipality may also approve, deny, or abandon the annexation of all or parts of the property under review. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(7) At any time during the process set forth in this Code section, the county or municipality may file a petition in superior court seeking sanctions against a party for any objections or proposed mitigating measures that lack substantial justification or that were interposed for purposes of delay or harassment. Such petition shall be assigned to a judge, pursuant to Code Section 15-1-9.1 or 15-6-13, who is not a judge in the circuit in which the county is located. The judge selected may also be a senior judge pursuant to Code Section 15-1-9.2 who resides in another circuit. The visiting or senior judge shall determine whether any objections or proposed mitigating measures lack substantial justification or were interposed for delay or harassment and shall assess against the party raising such objection or proposing or objecting to such mitigating measures the full cost of attorney fees and other costs incurred by the other party in responding to the objections or proposed mitigating measures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(8) Unless otherwise agreed, a zoning or rezoning decision made pursuant to this Code section shall not be effective until 28 calendar days following the completion of the process authorized by this Code section and the zoning or rezoning vote by the municipal governing authority. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(9) During the process set forth in this Code section, the municipal corporation may proceed with notice, hearings, and other requirements for zoning or rezoning in accordance with the municipality's zoning ordinance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the annexation, zoning, or rezoning is denied or abandoned based in whole or in part on the county's objections, the county shall not zone or rezone the property or allow any use of a similar or greater density or intensity to that proposed for the property which had been objected to by the county pursuant to this Code section for a one-year period after the denial or abandonment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process set forth in subsection (c) of this Code section specifies minimum procedures for addressing objections. However, a county and a municipality may agree to additional procedures by resolution of the county and municipal governing authorities. Notwithstanding subsections (c) and (d) of this Code section, any agreement to resolve county objections to a proposed land use of an area to be annexed into a municipality which agreement was in effect on January 1, 2004, and which includes a provision whereby the county and a municipality agree to be bound by the recommendations of an annexation appeals board shall remain in effect until the parties agree otherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">Authority is granted to the governing bodies of the several municipal corporations of this state to annex to the existing corporate limits thereof unincorporated areas contiguous to the existing corporate limits at the time of such annexation, in accordance with the procedures provided in this article and in Article 1 of this chapter, upon the written and signed applications of all of the owners of all of the land, except the owners of any public street, road, highway, or right of way, proposed to be annexed, containing a complete description of the lands to be annexed. Lands to be annexed at any one time shall be treated as one body, regardless of the number of owners, and all parts shall be considered as adjoining the limits of the municipal corporation when any one part of the entire body abuts such limits. When such application is acted upon by the municipal authorities and the land is, by ordinance, annexed to the municipal corporation, an identification of the property so annexed shall be filed with the Department of Community Affairs and with the governing authority of the county in which the property is located in accordance with Code Section 36-36-3. When so annexed, such lands shall constitute a part of the lands within the corporate limits of the municipal corporation as completely and fully as if the limits had been marked and defined by local Act of the General Assembly. Except as provided in subsection (c) of Code Section 36-36-20, nothing in this article shall be construed to authorize annexation of the length of any public right of way except to the extent that such right of way adjoins private property otherwise annexed by the municipal corporation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No intent to race for annexation.</b> - Georgia General Assembly did not intend the alternative methods of annexation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-36-10 to establish a system for municipalities to race the legislature to annex land that it already had designated for annexation under local law. City of Brookhaven v. City of Chamblee, 329 Ga. App. 346, 765 S.E.2d 33 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>General Assembly is authorized to delegate power of annexation</b> to municipalities under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-36-21. Cooper v. City of Gainesville, 248 Ga. 269, 282 S.E.2d 322 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Purpose of this section</b> in delegating limited power of annexation to municipalities is to permit municipalities to make a self-determination in this regard. Plantation Pipe Line Co. v. City of Bremen, 227 Ga. 1, 178 S.E.2d 868 (1970) (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-36-21).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Limitations on power of annexation.</b> - When the municipality exercises the delegated power of annexation the municipality is exercising the legislative power of the General Assembly and is limited only by the terms of the delegation itself and by the rule that the municipality's exercise must be lawful and reasonable and not in violation of any constitutional inhibition. Plantation Pipe Line Co. v. City of Bremen, 227 Ga. 1, 178 S.E.2d 868 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipality without authority to annex property during referendum process.</b> - Trial court properly held that a municipality did not have the authority under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-36-21 to annex land that the Georgia General Assembly designated for annexation to another municipality, subject to a referendum, before the referendum took place; thus, a city was prohibited from attempting to annex property during the referendum process. City of Brookhaven v. City of Chamblee, 329 Ga. App. 346, 765 S.E.2d 33 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Comparison of 100 percent and 60 percent methods of annexation.</b> - Requirements of the 100 percent method and the 60 percent method are different. In the 100 percent method, the land being annexed need only abut the municipal boundaries. In the 60 percent method, the land being annexed must coincide with the municipal boundaries on one-eighth of the municipality's aggregate external boundary. City of Marietta v. Cobb County Sch.

L. 1962, p. 119, <span class="s1">§</span> 2 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-36-20) is to explain the provision of Ga. L. 1962, p. 119, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-36-21) for annexing to the existing corporate limits unincorporated areas "contiguous to the existing corporate limits." This provision has no reference to any lands when the owners sign no application to annex. This provision's sole purpose is to say that although a road, creek, river, interstate highway, railroad, or even other municipal property of another political subdivision passes between the lands of "A" and the corporate boundary, "A's" land is contiguous for the purpose of annexing the land when "A" signs an application therefor.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure of annexation voids subsequently related annexation.</b> - Failure of city's annexation of railroad right of way due to applicant's lack of fee simple ownership also invalidated subsequent annexation of property which became contiguous to city only by virtue of the earlier annexation of the right of way. City of Jefferson v. Town of Pendergrass, 176 Ga. App. 769, 337 S.E.2d 343 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Annexation voided when procedures not followed.</b> - Defendants attempt to annex certain properties into the corporate limits of the city and establish a new zoning district was voided because the procedural requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-66-4 (a) and (b) and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-36-21 were not met.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Comparison of 100 percent and 60 percent methods of annexation.</b> - Requirements of the 100 percent method and the 60 percent method are different. In the 100 percent method, the land being annexed need only abut the municipal boundaries. In the 60 percent method, the land being annexed must coincide with the municipal boundaries on one-eighth of the municipality's aggregate external boundary. City of Marietta v. Cobb County Sch. Dist., 237 Ga. 518, 228 S.E.2d 894 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Involvement of only one landowner does not prohibit use of 60 percent method.</b> - When the procedures that must be followed in using the "60 percent method" were followed by the city in effecting an annexation, the fact that there was only one landowner involved and no electors involved in this annexation did not prohibit use of the "60 percent method" prescribed by statute.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Removal of persons "resident in the area".</b> - City had two options when the city found that 36 people were no longer "resident in the area." It could have challenged the names of the 36 people the city determined to be nonresidents and had the names removed from the list, or it could have sought others who were "resident in the area."

<p class="p6"><b>Need for voice of property owner to be heard.</b> - Legislature did not intend for any property to be annexed to a municipal corporation without the owner of the property at least being allowed a voice on the question of such annexation. Of course, if the county or State School Building Authority (now Georgia Education Authority (Schools)) or some other governmental entity chooses not to make application for annexation, but at least 60 percent of the other owners of property in the area making application for annexation do apply, the statutory requirements are met irrespective of the wishes of some owners. 1967 Op.

<p class="p11">(1) It must be adjacent or contiguous to the municipal corporation's boundaries at the time the annexation proceeding is begun; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

This requirement may be waived by written agreement of the municipal corporation proposing annexation and of the other unit of government affected. Where a waiver of this requirement is applicable, a copy of the agreement shall be made a part of the report required by Code Section 36-36-56.

An area developed for urban purposes is defined as any area which, on the date of the adoption of the annexation resolution, has a total resident population equal to at least two persons for each acre of land included within its boundaries and is subdivided into lots and tracts such that at least 60 percent of the total acreage consists of lots and tracts five acres or less in size and such that at least 60 percent of the total number of lots and tracts are one acre or less in size. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to areas developed for urban purposes, a governing body may include in the area to be annexed any area which does not meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this Code section if such area lies between the municipal boundary and an area developed for urban purposes such that the area developed for urban purposes is either not adjacent to the municipal boundary or cannot be served by the municipal corporation without extending services and water and sewer lines through the sparsely developed area and, if such area is adjacent, on at least 60 percent of its external boundary to any combination of the municipal boundary and the boundary of an area or areas developed for urban purposes as defined in subsection (c) of this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(a) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The arbitration panel appointed pursuant to Code Section 36-36-114 shall meet as soon after appointment as practicable and shall receive evidence and argument from the municipal corporation, the county, and the applicant or property owner and shall by majority vote render a decision which shall be binding on all parties to the dispute as provided for in this article not later than the sixtieth day following such appointment. The meetings of the panel in which evidence is submitted or arguments of the parties are made shall be open to the public pursuant to Chapter 14 of Title 50. The panel shall first determine the validity of the grounds for objection as specified in the objection. If an objection involves the financial impact on the county as a result of a change in zoning or land use or the provision of maintenance of infrastructure, the panel shall quantify such impact in terms of cost. As to any objection which the panel has determined to be valid, the panel, in its findings, may establish reasonable zoning, land use, or density conditions applicable to the annexation and propose any reasonable mitigating measures as to an objection pertaining to infrastructure demands. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) In arriving at its determination, the panel shall consider: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) The existing comprehensive land use plans of both the county and city; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The existing land use patterns in the area of the subject property; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(F) Whether the county has approved similar developments in other unincorporated areas of the county which have a similar impact on infrastructure as complained of by the county in its objection; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(G) Whether the infrastructure or capital outlay project which is claimed adversely impacted by the county in its objection was funded by a county-wide tax. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) The county shall provide supporting evidence that its objection is consistent with its land use plan and the pattern of existing land uses and zonings in the area of the subject property. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) The county shall bear at least 75 percent of the cost of the arbitration. The panel shall apportion the remaining 25 percent of the cost of the arbitration equitably between the city and the county as the facts of the appeal warrant; provided, however, that if the panel determines that any party has advanced a position that is substantially frivolous, the costs shall be borne by the party that has advanced such position. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(5) The reasonable costs of participation in the arbitration process of the property owner or owners whose property is at issue shall be borne by the county and the city in the same proportion as costs are apportioned under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(6) The panel shall deliver its findings and recommendations to the parties by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the decision of the panel contains zoning, land use, or density conditions, the findings and recommendations of the panel shall be recorded in the deed records of the county with a caption describing the name of the current owner of the property, recording reference of the current owner's acquisition deed and a general description of the property, and plainly showing the expiration date of any restrictions or conditions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The arbitration panel shall be dissolved on the tenth day after it renders its findings and recommendations but may be reconvened as provided in Code Section 36-36-116. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">The municipal or county governing authority or an applicant for annexation may appeal the decision of the arbitration panel by filing an action in the superior court of the county within ten calendar days from receipt of the panel's findings and recommendations. The sole grounds for appeal shall be to correct errors of fact or of law, the bias or misconduct of an arbitrator, or the panel's abuse of discretion. The superior court shall schedule an expedited appeal and shall render a decision within 20 days from the date of filing. If the court finds that an error of fact or law has been made, that an arbitrator was biased or engaged in misconduct, or that the panel has abused its discretion, the court shall issue such orders governing the proposed annexation as the circumstances may require, including remand to the panel. Any unappealed order shall be binding upon the parties.

<p class="p6"><b>Property held by municipality for governmental or public uses</b> cannot be sold without express legislative authority, but must be devoted to the use and purpose for which the property was intended. Harper v. City Council, 212 Ga. 605, 94 S.E.2d 690 (1956) (decided under former Ga. L. 1956, p. 22 and local law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Distinction between land held in governmental and proprietary capacities.</b> - There is a clear distinction between property purchased by a municipal corporation and held for use by the municipal corporation as an entity, or in the municipality's proprietary capacity, and property purchased by the city for the public use and benefit of the municipality's citizens. As to property acquired for strictly corporate purposes and held in the municipal corporation's proprietary capacity, the power to dispose is unquestioned, but as to the latter, in the absence of express legislative authority, it is only when the public use has been abandoned or the property has become unsuitable or inadequate for the purpose to which the property was dedicated that the city has the power to dispose of such property. Harper v. City Council, 212 Ga. 605, 94 S.E.2d 690 (1956) (decided under former Ga. L. 1956, p. 22 and local law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Property held by a municipality for governmental or public uses cannot be sold without express legislative authority, but must be devoted to the use and purpose for which the property was intended. The rule is otherwise as to property held by a municipality in the municipality's proprietary or private capacity when not devoted to any specific public use. Kirkland v. Johnson, 209 Ga. 824, 76 S.E.2d 396 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 69-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Though land be bought for public use, if not actually used</b> for such purpose it cannot be said to be held by municipality affected by public trust, and may be sold. Kirkland v.

<p class="p6"><b>Power to swap and trade.</b> - General Assembly did not intend by minor rearrangement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-37-6 to expand the powers of municipalities, or to relieve the municipalities of the bidding requirements of the 1976 act, or to alter settled principles of the common law restricting the alienation of dedicated public lands; the power to swap and trade cemetery lots and personal property of limited value remains just that, and nothing more.

<p class="p6"><b>No lease of park for term of years for private gain.</b> - Weight of authority is that a municipal park is a public utility, and a portion thereof cannot be leased for a term of years for private gain.

In such event, the municipal corporation shall procure all materials, provide the machinery and equipment, and do all of the work necessary in making such improvement. If the governing body determines that the municipal corporation shall itself do the work necessary in making the improvement, the resolution expressing the determination of the governing body to proceed with the improvement shall so state; and such resolution shall fix a time and place at which the owners of the property affected by the proposed improvement shall have the right to file objections thereto. Notice of the resolution and of the intention of the governing body to cause the work to be done by the municipal corporation shall be published in at least six consecutive issues of a daily paper having a general circulation in the municipal corporation or once a week for two weeks in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements for the county in which the municipal corporation is situated are published. The notice shall set out the time and place at which objections may be filed, which time shall be not less than ten days following the last publication of the notice. The owners of the lots or parcels of land fronting or abutting upon any street or portion thereof upon which such improvement is proposed to be made shall have the right, within the time prescribed, to file written objections to the performance of the work by the municipal corporation. In the event that the owners of a majority of the lineal frontage of the lots or parcels of land fronting or abutting upon any such street or portion thereof object to the doing of the work by the municipal corporation, the work shall be done under contract and the governing body shall proceed in the manner provided in this chapter for the letting of the work under contract. If no objections are filed by the owners of a majority of the lineal frontage of the lots or parcels of land fronting or abutting on any such street or portion thereof within the time prescribed, the municipal corporation itself shall proceed with the doing of the work necessary in making the improvement. Where the work of making the improvement is done by the municipal corporation, the cost thereof shall include the entire cost of all materials used and labor done in the performance of the work, shall include a reasonable rental for the use of machinery, equipment, and materials used in the doing of the work, and shall also include all engineering, legal, and other expenses incurred in connection with the doing of the work or the proceedings under which the same is done.

<p class="p6"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - General Assembly intended to aid qualifying municipalities to fulfill the municipalities' responsibility to provide a system of roads and streets and to aid the municipalities in providing traffic control. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction of section.</b> - This section should be strictly construed, but construed in pari materia with prior acts and amendments authorizing grants to municipalities. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Funds received by municipalities</b> must be used for "devices and equipment" which have as their primary function direct control of traffic or else provide a direct accommodation to the general flow of traffic. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipalities may expend funds</b> granted under this section only for purchase, construction, improvement, maintenance, and repair of capital outlay items. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-171.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Determining what are traffic control devices.</b> - General Assembly by the language of this section intended to confer upon the municipalities qualifying under this section some latitude in determining what are "traffic control devices and equipment to control and accommodate the flow of traffic"; however, such latitude is not completely discretionary without limitations. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What are activities incident to providing road system.</b> - To construct and maintain a system of public roads, streets, sidewalks, bridges and appurtenances, and to provide traffic control devices and equipment to control and accommodate the flow of traffic therein would be "activities incident to providing and maintaining an adequate system of public roads and bridges in this State" under the provisions of Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. IX, Para. IV (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec. IX, Para VI(b)). This section declares the same within its latitude. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Term "capital outlay items,"</b> as used in this law, would include any expenditure on behalf of municipalities for long-term additions or betterments properly chargeable to a capital asset account. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-171.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Investment not restricted.</b> - General Assembly intended funds granted to municipalities to be special funds and did not intend to restrict the funds so as to prohibit the funds' temporary investment so long as the investment does not interfere in any way with the expedient use of the funds for the purpose provided in the act, and the maturity date of the government obligations does not extend beyond the date when such funds shall be needed for these purposes. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-35.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Use of word "shall" permissive as to question of temporary investment of funds.</b> - Limitation imposed by this section authorizing grants was intended by the legislature to be a limitation on the final use of these funds and the word "shall" as used in the section should be interpreted as permissive or directory when the question of temporary investment of these funds is considered. Certainly no right or benefit is lost by taking this interpretation; but to the contrary, the benefit of capital earnings is lost if this interpretation is not taken. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-35.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Legitimacy of expenses for street lights.</b> - When street lights are installed or rented primarily to directly control or accommodate the general flow of traffic, the expenses for such installation or rental would be legitimate expenses under this section. However, when street lights are installed or rented as a general city improvement or as a measure to control crime, expenses of installation or renting would not be qualified expenditures. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Street name sign expenses not legitimate.</b> - As the usual and general purpose for street name signs is to facilitate individuals in gaining directions and is not, strictly speaking, a measure directed at controlling or accommodating the general flow of traffic, street name signs are not a legitimate expenditure under this section. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bush hog mower expenses not legitimate.</b> - Since bush hog mowers for rights of way and litter barrels do not have as a primary function the direct control or accommodation of the flow of traffic, although mowers and barrels may indirectly, or as an auxiliary purpose, facilitate the flow of traffic, the mowers and barrels would not be qualified expenditures within the strict construction of this section. 1965-66 Op.

The per capita amount as so determined shall then be multiplied by the population of each such remaining municipal corporation to arrive at its respective grant.

<p class="p11">It is found, determined, and declared:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11">(1) That there exists within the large municipalities of the state a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing which a significant portion of the persons and families residing or desiring to reside in such municipalities can afford. This shortage is inimical to the safety, health, and welfare of the residents of this state and the sound growth of its large municipalities. The cost of financing the ownership and rehabilitation of housing in such municipalities is a major factor affecting the ability of a person to obtain decent and safe housing therein. In order to remedy such housing shortages, it is necessary to implement a public program to reduce the cost of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of housing, in order to make the acquisition of housing feasible for all persons and families residing or desiring to reside in the large municipalities of the state; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) That it is necessary and essential that public corporations be created for such large municipalities of the state directly, or indirectly through qualified lending institutions, to make loans at rates below market to finance either the acquisition or rehabilitation or both of residential housing and to acquire mortgages in order to encourage investment in and upgrade urban areas; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) That it is necessary and in the best interests of the state to provide loans at rates below market for the acquisition and rehabilitation of housing which will: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) Provide for and promote the public health, safety, and welfare in the large municipalities of the state; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) Reduce unemployment and encourage the increase of industrial and commercial activities and economic development in the large municipalities; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) Provide for the efficient and well-planned growth and development of the large municipalities, including the elimination and prevention of slum areas and blight, and for the proper coordination of industrial facilities with public services, mass transportation facilities, and residential development, by providing an incentive for home ownership within the geographical limits of the large municipalities; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(D) Assist persons and families in acquiring and owning decent, safe, and sanitary housing which they can afford within the geographic limits of the large municipalities; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(E) Promote the integration of families of varying economic means in the large municipalities; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(F) Preserve and increase the tax base of the large municipalities; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) Accordingly, that it is a valid public purpose, as a matter of public health, safety, convenience, and welfare, to assist in providing financing for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of housing in the large municipalities of the state and that the creation of public corporations and instrumentalities of the state is the most feasible method by which the state can accomplish such public purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">It is found and declared that economically and socially depressed areas exist within counties and municipalities of this state and that these areas contribute to or cause unemployment, limit the tax resources of counties and municipalities, and create a greater demand for governmental services and, in general, have a deleterious effect upon the public health, safety, morals, and welfare. It is, therefore, in the public interest that such areas be redeveloped to the maximum extent practicable to improve economic and social conditions therein in order to abate or eliminate such deleterious effects. To encourage such redevelopment, it is essential that the counties and municipalities of this state have additional powers to form a more effective partnership with private enterprise to overcome economic limitations that have previously impeded or prohibited redevelopment of such areas. It is the purpose of this chapter, therefore, to grant such additional powers to the counties and municipalities of this state, and it is the intention of the General Assembly that this chapter be liberally construed to carry out such purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Contract under section is not debt.</b> - Contract which satisfies the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-60-13 does not constitute a "debt" within the meaning of Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. V, Para. I and therefore does not require voter approval. Barkley v. City of Rome, 259 Ga. 355, 381 S.E.2d 34 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Lease agreement is not debt.</b> - There is no distinction in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-60-13 between real and personal property and the strictures on leases for each class of property are the same; similarly, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. V, Para. I(a), providing for a popular vote on the assumption of debt, makes no distinction between the two classes of property. Therefore, a county's decision to enter a lease purchase agreement with the Association of County Commissioners of Georgia to finance and construct a new courthouse was not a debt requiring a vote under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. V, Para. I(a) and was in compliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-60-13 because it did not require future county commissioners to renew the contract, it allowed the county to terminate its financial obligations at the end of each calendar year, and it would never require the county to expend more than would be legally available under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-60-13.

<p class="p6"><b>Requirements of section violated.</b> - Multi-year computer lease purchase agreement entered into by the county violated the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-60-13; therefore, the trial court properly granted the county's motion for summary judgment.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Multiyear lease provision ambiguous.</b> - Multiyear lease provision allowing termination of the lease pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-60-13 was ambiguous and the record did not show whether a county and the county's lessee intended the provision to apply generally to the lease or only if <span class="s1">§</span> 36-60-13 became applicable (i.e., appropriated funds were no longer available to allow the county to perform the county's obligations under lease). Thus, the county's right to terminate the lease under that provision was a fact issue for the jury to resolve. Etowah Valley Sporting Clay Park, LLC v. Dawson County, 294 Ga.

The governing authority shall take into consideration such information to assist it in determining the eligibility of any applicant. The award of a lease or contract pursuant to this Code section shall be made to the responsible and responsive applicant whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the governmental entity, taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. All information required by the county or municipality pursuant to this Code section shall be provided by the applicant under oath.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is found and declared that there exist in municipalities and counties of this state pockets of blight, as defined in paragraph (15) of Code Section 36-61-2, which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of this state; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities and counties, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems, and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of pockets of blight is a matter of state policy and state concern, in order that this state and its municipalities and counties shall not continue to be endangered by areas which are local centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency, and, while contributing little to the tax income of this state and its municipalities and counties, consume an excessive proportion of its revenues because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization, and other forms of public protection, services, and facilities. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A municipality or county, to the greatest extent it determines to be feasible in carrying out the provisions of this chapter, shall afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the municipality or county as a whole, to the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the urban redevelopment area by private enterprise. A municipality or county shall give consideration to this objective in exercising its powers under this chapter, including: the formulation of a workable program; the approval of urban redevelopment plans consistent with the general plan for the municipality or county; the adoption and enforcement of ordinances as provided for in Code Section 36-61-11; the exercise of its zoning powers; the enforcement of other laws, codes, and regulations relating to the use of land and the use and occupancy of buildings and improvements; the disposition of any property acquired; and the provision of necessary public improvements. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notwithstanding anything in this chapter or other provisions of law to the contrary, and in order to give effect to the encouragement of private enterprise contemplated in this Code section, the following shall apply to contracts and agreements for surface transportation projects entered into pursuant to this chapter: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(1) In addition to other methods of procurement authorized by law, the sponsoring local government, urban redevelopment agency, or other governing body shall be authorized to utilize the procedures of this chapter to provide for the planning, design, finance, construction, acquisition, leasing, operation, and maintenance of surface transportation projects. The provisions of this chapter shall be an alternative to such other methods to be exercised at the option of each sponsoring local government or public body; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) One or more public bodies may participate in the consideration and implementation of a surface transportation project at the discretion of the sponsoring local government. Where more than one public body agrees to participate in the consideration or implementation of a surface transportation project, the participants may designate one or more representatives of each such participating public body, as agreed to by the sponsoring local government or the urban redevelopment agency; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) (A) An urban redevelopment agency designated by the sponsoring local government may evaluate a project to determine the appropriate or desirable levels of public and private participation in planning, designing, financing, constructing, operating, maintaining, or facilitating, or any combination thereof, for the execution of such project. Such urban redevelopment agency may designate a public nonprofit, private corporation, body, or entity to perform this function and to otherwise perform the activities contemplated in this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) A sponsoring local government or an urban redevelopment agency shall be authorized to issue, individually or in sequenced stages, written requests for expressions of interest, qualifications, or proposals, or any combination thereof, or other similar methods of procurement or solicitation. Such requests shall indicate the scope of the project, the proposed public and private financial participation in the project, including, but not limited to, the rights, responsibilities, obligations, revenue sharing features, any lease, license, availability or other payment rights, and any other allocations of interests and federal and state income tax benefits in respect of real and personal property relating to a project. Such requests shall include the factors to be used in evaluating responses, the relative importance of any applicable evaluation factors, and other contractual terms and conditions expected, including any unique capabilities or qualifications that will be required of respondents, as determined in the sole discretion of the designated representative of the sponsoring local government. Public notice of such requests shall be made at least 30 days prior to the date set for the release of said request by posting a legal notice on the websites and weekly in the legal organ of the sponsoring local government and the public body implementing the project, in substantially the same manner utilized by such public bodies in order to solicit requests for proposals, with a copy of such notice provided simultaneously to each affected public body. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) (i) The public body implementing the project and the sponsoring local government, with the participation of any designated representatives of other participating public bodies as determined by the sponsoring local government, may engage in individual discussions and interviews with each respondent deemed fully qualified, responsible, and suitable on the basis of initial responses and with emphasis on professional competence and ability to meet the level of private financial participation as called for in such request. Repetitive interviews may be conducted. Any such interviews shall be deemed to be a part of the procurement process. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(ii) (I) At the conclusion of the final stage, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request and all information developed in the selection process, the public body implementing the surface transportation project, in an open and public meeting subject to the provisions of Chapter 14 of Title 50, shall rank the proposals in accordance with the factors set forth in the request for proposal or invitation for bids. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(II) After ranking the proposals, the public body implementing the project shall begin negotiations with the first ranked private entity. If such public body and first ranked private entity do not reach a comprehensive agreement or interim agreement, such public body may conduct negotiations with the next ranked private entity. Such process shall continue until such public body either voluntarily abandons the process or executes a comprehensive agreement or interim agreement with a private entity. Negotiations conducted with one or more selected respondents pursuant to this Code section shall continue to be deemed an active procurement until the execution of the final, definitive agreement with the selected respondent or respondents. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(iii) The public body implementing the project shall select for approval the respondent offering the most satisfactory and advantageous contract terms for the project based upon a thorough assessment of any one or more of the following: experience and reputation with similar projects; engineering and design quality; value; projected savings during, before, or after construction; and the ability of the final project's characteristics to meet the goals of the sponsoring local government, consistent with applicable plans and programs. The fair market value of any property included as a part of the procurement may be based on the consideration of the above factors, but it shall not be less than the initial cost to obtain the property. Before making such selection, the designated representative shall consult in an open and public meeting subject to the provisions of Chapter 14 of Title 50 with the representatives of any participating local governing authority, participating local authority, participating state agency, department, or authority, and affected local government. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms and conditions for multiple awards are included in the request, the implementing public body may award contracts to more than one respondent. Should the implementing public body determine in writing that only one respondent is fully qualified, or that one respondent is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the other respondents under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that respondent. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Demand that just and adequate compensation be first paid</b> is imperative. It means that such payment covers its value at the time of taking and not its value many rental periods or years prior to the actual institution of condemnation proceedings. Housing Auth. v. Schroeder, 222 Ga. 417, 151 S.E.2d 226 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Exercise of power of eminent domain</b> under this section must be pursuant to the formulation of an urban redevelopment plan which necessitates the acquisition of specific real property to effectuate its purposes. McCord v. Housing Auth., 246 Ga. 547, 272 S.E.2d 247 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Qualification on right of eminent domain.</b> - Right of the state to obtain private property for the public purpose of urban redevelopment is qualified by the requirement that the property owner must be permitted to develop the owner's land personally in accordance with the proposed plan, if the owner so desires and if the owner has the resources to do so. McCord v. Housing Auth., 246 Ga. 547, 272 S.E.2d 247 (1980); Ward v. Housing Auth., 157 Ga. App. 825, 278 S.E.2d 715 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Requirement of specificity in urban redevelopment plan.</b> - When, pursuant to court order, condemnee was provided with a map showing the proposed use of the condemnee's land, in conjunction with the lands of other owners, as part of a 66,600 square foot warehouse, any requirement of specificity in an urban redevelopment plan was amply satisfied by this information. Waller v. Clayton County, 200 Ga. App. 706, 409 S.E.2d 561, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 897, 409 S.E.2d 561 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Option of landowner to develop personally.</b> - This section gives a private landowner the option of retaining ownership of the land and developing the land in accordance with the urban redevelopment plan when the land was to be put to a nonpublic use. McCord v. Housing Auth., 246 Ga. 547, 272 S.E.2d 247 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Term "multiple ownership"</b> refers to a situation when a particular parcel within the tract to be condemned is owned by more than one person, rather than to all owners of all parcels within the tract. McCord v. Housing Auth., 246 Ga. 547, 272 S.E.2d 247 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Term "property"</b> refers to each individual parcel within the tract to be condemned, rather than to the tract as a whole, thus extending to each parcel owner the option of retaining ownership and developing in accordance with the urban redevelopment plan. McCord v. Housing Auth., 246 Ga. 547, 272 S.E.2d 247 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Not applicable to conveyance of previously condemned property.</b> - Even assuming the original condemnation proceeding was conducted pursuant to the Urban Redevelopment Law and that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-61-9 was applicable to it, the 2003 conveyance was not a re-taking by a municipality or county and thus the transaction was not governed by the requirements of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 36-61-9. By its terms, the statute applies to the original taking of property by eminent domain. The 2003 conveyance was, instead, a re-purposing of the property from that involved in the original taking.

Such sale, lease, other transfer, or retention and any agreement relating thereto may be made only after the approval of the urban redevelopment plan by the local governing body. The purchasers or lessees and their successors and assigns shall be obligated to devote such real property only to the uses specified in the urban redevelopment plan and may be obligated to comply with such other requirements as the municipality or county may determine to be in the public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on the real property required by the urban redevelopment plan. Such real property or interest shall be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the urban redevelopment plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the urban redevelopment plan, a municipality or county shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in such plan; the restrictions upon and the covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee or by the municipality or county retaining the property; and the objectives of such plan for the prevention of the recurrence of pockets of blight. The municipality or county in any instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee may provide that such purchaser or lessee shall be without power to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the real property without the prior written consent of the municipality or county until he or she has completed the construction of any and all improvements which he or she has obligated himself or herself to construct thereon. Real property acquired by a municipality or county which, in accordance with the provisions of the urban redevelopment plan, is to be transferred shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the carrying out of the provisions of the urban redevelopment plan. The inclusion in any such contract or conveyance to a purchaser or lessee of any such covenants, restrictions, or conditions, including the incorporation by reference therein of the provisions of an urban redevelopment plan or any part thereof, shall not prevent the filing of the contract or conveyance in the land records of the county in such manner as to afford actual or constructive notice thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A municipality or county, by public notice by publication once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the community, prior to the execution of any contract to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer real property and prior to the delivery of any instrument of conveyance with respect thereto under this Code section, may invite proposals from and make available all pertinent information to private redevelopers or any persons interested in undertaking to redevelop or rehabilitate an urban redevelopment area or any part thereof. The notice shall identify the area or portion thereof and shall state that such further information as is available may be obtained at such office as shall be designated in the notice. The municipality or county shall consider all such redevelopment or rehabilitation proposals and the financial and legal ability of the persons making such proposals to carry them out and may negotiate with any persons for proposals for the purchase, lease, or other transfer of any real property acquired by the municipality or county in the urban redevelopment area. The municipality or county may accept such proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.

<p class="p6"><b>Failure to meet characteristics of office building or hotel facility.</b> - In a taxpayers' suit against a county and officials, the court upheld the grant of summary judgment to the county because the testimony of counsel for the taxpayers was insufficient to create an issue of material fact on the taxpayer's claims in regard to the tax-exempt status of the county development authority-owned properties as there was no evidence that any of the properties actually possessed the characteristics of an office building or hotel facility as defined in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-62-2.

<p class="p6"><b>Distinction between land held in governmental and proprietary capacities.</b> - There is a clear distinction between property purchased by a municipal corporation and held for use by the corporation as an entity, or in the municipality's proprietary capacity, and property purchased by the city for the public use and benefit of the city's citizens. As to property acquired for strictly corporate purposes and held in the city's proprietary capacity, the power to dispose is unquestioned, but as to the latter, in the absence of express legislative authority, it is only when the public use has been abandoned or the property has become unsuitable or inadequate for the purpose to which the property was dedicated that the city has power to dispose of such property.

<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to address constitutional issue on part of trial court.</b> - Trial court erred by failing to address whether a 1993 county zoning ordinance was constitutional because the record established that the landfill permit applicant raised a constitutional challenge to the zoning ordinance before the trial court in its response to the challengers' motion for partial summary judgment and, in fact, in its transfer order to the appellate court, the trial court specifically stated that the court did not rule on the applicant's constitutional argument. Southern States-Bartow County, Inc. v. Riverwood Farm Prop. Owners Ass'n, Inc., 331 Ga. App. 878, 769 S.E.2d 823 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Zoning ordinance properly enacted.</b> - Evidence was sufficient to establish that the enactment of a county's zoning ordinance complied with the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-66-1 et seq., when the board of commissioners adopted the zoning ordinance after the ordinance was read, a public meeting was held, changes to the proposed ordinance were made, and another public hearing was held at which the zoning map was available, and amendments to the zoning ordinance were approved pursuant to the zoning administrator's recommendations, a public meeting was held on the amendments, and the board then adopted the amendments without change.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Superseded portions of ordinances need not be kept.</b> - There is nothing in the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-66-1 et seq., or the cases interpreting that law, that conditions validity of a zoning ordinance on the retention of superseded portions of the ordinance.

<p class="p6">Since a real estate developer had neither concluded the purchase of property or made substantial expenditures in reliance upon the probable issuance of a building permit until after the county amended its zoning ordinance to the detriment of the developer, the developer did not acquire a vested right to develop the property in question in conformity with the old ordinance; the county board of commissioner's letter to the developer amounted to an agreement to amend the ordinance and, thus, invoked the notice and hearing requirements under Georgia's Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-66-1 et seq.

<p class="p6"><b>Zoning map properly incorporated by reference.</b> - County zoning ordinance properly incorporated by reference an official zoning map as the board of commissioners had a zoning map before the commissioners when the commissioners considered the ordinance, the zoning map was in existence when a limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) bought the property and that map was kept in the zoning administrator's office, the new zoning administrator's uncertainty about which of two maps was the official map did not render the entire zoning ordinance invalid, and it was clear that the LLLP's land was not zoned for a landfill.

<p class="p6"><b>Failure to establish standing.</b> - Dismissal of the appellants' petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the grant of a special use permit to the appellees was upheld because the appellants only alleged generally that the art farm would create noise, light, and traffic, and that it would decrease property values, without alleging how those effects would harm the appellants differently than other property owners in the area.

<p class="p6"><b>Overlay zoning ordinances.</b> - With regard to the landowners' action against a town and the town's officials alleging the unconstitutionality and invalidity of an overlay zoning district, the trial court erred by denying the landowners' motion for partial summary judgment with regard to the landowners' claim that the town did not have any legal authority to impose the requirements of the overlay zoning ordinance for right-of-way improvements on the state route abutting the property since the property at issue was outside the territorial boundaries of the town. Therefore, the requirements of the overlay zoning ordinance were invalid as to the property since the town had no zoning authority over the property. Century Ctr. at Braselton, LLC v.

<p class="p6"><b>Reference to "legislative" action not determinative.</b> - Because a decision denying a conditional use permit required the zoning board to determine the facts and apply the ordinance's legal standards to them, which was a decision-making process akin to a judicial act, the decision was reviewable by certiorari under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-1(a); the owner's failure to file a certiorari petition barred the owner's claims.

</b></p>
<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">The intent of this article is to provide a flexible framework within which local governments in each county can develop a service delivery system that is both efficient and responsive to citizens in their county. The General Assembly recognizes that the unique characteristics of each county throughout the state preclude a mandated legislative outcome for the delivery of services in every county. The process provided by this article is intended to minimize inefficiencies resulting from duplication of services and competition between local governments and to provide a mechanism to resolve disputes over local government service delivery, funding equity, and land use. The local government service delivery process should result in the minimization of noncompatible municipal and county land use plans and in a simple, concise agreement describing which local governments will provide which service in specified areas within a county and how provision of such services will be funded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">In the development of a service delivery strategy, the following criteria shall be met:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11">(1) The strategy shall promote the delivery of local government services in the most efficient, effective, and responsive manner. The strategy shall identify steps which will be taken to remediate or avoid overlapping and unnecessary competition and duplication of service delivery and shall identify the time frame in which such steps shall be taken. When a municipality provides a service at a higher level than the base level of service provided throughout the geographic area of the county by the county, such service shall not be considered a duplication of the county service; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) (A) The strategy shall provide that water or sewer fees charged to customers located outside the geographic boundaries of a service provider shall not be arbitrarily higher than the fees charged to customers receiving such service which are located within the geographic boundaries of the service provider. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) If a governing authority disputes the reasonableness of water and sewer rate differentials imposed within its jurisdiction by another governing authority, that disputing governing authority may hold a public hearing for the purpose of reviewing the rate differential. Following the preparation of a rate study by a qualified engineer, the governing authority may challenge the arbitrary rate differentials on behalf of its residents in a court of competent jurisdiction. Prior to such challenge, the dispute shall be submitted to some form of alternative dispute resolution; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) (A) The strategy shall ensure that the cost of any service which a county provides primarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area of the county shall be borne by the unincorporated area residents, individuals, and property owners who receive the service. Further, when the county and one or more municipalities jointly fund a county-wide service, the county share of such funding shall be borne by the unincorporated residents, individuals, and property owners that receive the service. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) Such funding shall be derived from special service districts created by the county in which property taxes, insurance premium taxes, assessments, or user fees are levied or imposed or through such other mechanism agreed upon by the affected parties which complies with the intent of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) (A) Local governments within the same county shall, if necessary, amend their land use plans so that such plans are compatible and nonconflicting, or, as an alternative, they shall adopt a single land use plan for the unincorporated and incorporated areas of the county. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The authority, in such instruments, may provide for the pledging of all or any part of its revenues, income, or charges and for the mortgaging, encumbering, or conveying of all or any part of its real or personal property; may covenant against pledging any or all of its revenues, income, or charges; and may further provide for the disposition of proceeds realized from the sale of any bonds and bond anticipation notes, for the replacement of lost, destroyed, stolen, or mutilated bonds and notes, and for the payment and redemption of such bonds and notes. Similarly, subject to the limitations and procedures of this Code section, undertakings of an authority may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders and noteholders may enforce rights against the authority and provide for rights upon breach of any covenant, condition, or obligation of the authority.

The applicant for or holder of a state franchise shall start assessing the franchise fee within 15 days of receipt of written notice from the affected local governing authority or its authorized designee and shall not be required to pay such franchise fee until the expiration of 15 days after receipt of such written notice.

<p class="p6"><b>Borrowing for construction projects.</b> - When allotted funds from the State Board of Education for school construction result in construction projects of less than $200,000.00, the Georgia Education Authority (Schools) does not directly supervise construction but requires the local school system to construct the project itself and then be reimbursed by the authority. This procedure often makes it necessary for the local school system to borrow a substantial part of the construction costs for a period of nine months to a year, and such borrowing is within the legal power of local school systems. 1968 Op.

This agreed upon procedures report shall be in a format prescribed by the state auditor and shall constitute an annual audit report for purposes of and within the meaning of the requirements of subsections (d) through (g) of this Code section. The Department of Community Affairs is authorized to assist requesting local governments in preparing agreed upon procedures reports required under this paragraph and in establishing record-keeping procedures needed in preparing those reports and is further authorized to charge those local governments reasonable fees for that assistance. To the extent that the state auditor is able to perform the agreed upon procedures, the governing body may contract with the state auditor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The form shall be designed by the state auditor and shall be distributed with each covered grant as required by this Code section. The grant certification form shall require the certification by the recipient unit of local government and by the unit of local government auditor that the grant funds were used solely for the express purpose or purposes for which the grant was made. Such form shall be filed with the state auditor in conjunction with the annual audit required under Code Section 36-81-7 or 50-6-6 or any other applicable Code section for each year in which such grant funds are expended or remain unexpended by the unit of local government. A recipient unit of local government which is not otherwise subject to the annual audit requirements specified in this subsection shall file a grant certification form with the state auditor no later than December 31 of each year in which such grant funds are expended or remain unexpended. For grant funds to subrecipients, the certification by the unit of local government auditor required by this subsection may also be made by an in-house or internal auditor of the unit of local government who meets the education requirements contained in subparagraph (b)(3)(A) of Code Section 43-3-9. The cost of performing any audit required by this subsection or paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of this Code section shall be an eligible expense of the grant.

However, where such grant is to a subrecipient, the grant shall require submission to the unit of local government of a notarized affidavit executed by the executive director, president, chairperson, chief executive officer, or other responsible party representing the subrecipient, by whatever name or title, to whom the grant funds are disbursed. The affidavit shall certify under oath that the funds were used solely for the express purpose or purposes for which the grant was made. Such affidavit shall be submitted annually for each year that grant funds are expended or remain unexpended according to a schedule established by the unit of local government and shall be made on a form designed by the state auditor and distributed with each covered grant as required by this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In the case of a state grant awarded to a subrecipient, the subrecipient shall be responsible for the return to the state of any such grant funds if it is determined that the funds were not used for the express purpose or purposes for which the grant was made. A grant recipient or subrecipient shall be ineligible to receive funds from the Governor's emergency fund or from a special project appropriation until all unallowed expenditures are returned to the state, except that a recipient unit of local government shall not be ineligible for such funds where a subrecipient has not used funds it received for the express purpose or purposes for which the grant was made. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision desires to incur any bonded debt, as permitted by the Constitution of Georgia, the election required shall be called and held in accordance with this Code section and Code Sections 36-82-2 through 36-82-4. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The officers charged with levying taxes, contracting debts, and the like for the county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision shall give notice for not less than 30 days immediately preceding the day of the election in the newspaper in which sheriff's advertisements for the county are published, notifying the qualified voters that on the day named an election will be held to determine the question of whether bonds shall be issued by the county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision. The notice shall specify the principal amount of the bonds to be issued, the purpose for which the bonds are issued, the interest rate or rates which such bonds are to bear, and the amount of principal to be paid in each year during the life of the bonds. The notice, in the discretion of the issuing body, in lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which the bonds are to bear, may state that the bonds, when issued, will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest specified in the election notice or, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, that none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate specified in the election notice. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing contained in this Code section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of the issuing body to sell bonds at a discount, even if in so doing the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in the election notice. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every legal advertisement of a bond election shall contain a reference that any brochures, listings, or other advertisements issued by the governing body of any county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state or by any other person, firm, corporation, or association with the knowledge and consent of the governing body of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state shall be deemed to be a statement of intention of the governing body of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state concerning the use of the bond funds; and such statement of intention shall be binding on the governing body of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state in the expenditure of any such bond funds or interest received from such bond funds which have been invested, unless the governing body of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state uses such bond funds for the retirement of bonded indebtedness, in the manner provided for in this Code section; and such statement of intention shall be set forth in the resolution pursuant to which such bonds are issued. Bond funds and interest received from such bond funds which have been invested shall be expended in the manner in which advertised and for the purpose stated in such statement of intention. The governing body of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state may, by a two-thirds' vote, declare any project which has been established pursuant to any such statement of intention to be unnecessary. In that event, the governing body of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state shall use such bond funds for the payment of all or any part of the principal and interest on any bonded indebtedness of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state then outstanding. Surpluses from the overestimated projects, including interest received on bond funds of such projects, shall be used first to complete underestimated projects and all remaining funds received from interest and overestimated projects shall be used for other projects or improvements which the governing body of such county, municipality, or other political subdivision of this state may deem necessary and which are encompassed within the language of the statement of purpose in the election notice. Any meetings of any governing bodies at which any bond fund allocation is made shall be open to the public. Such meetings shall be announced to the news media in advance and shall be open to the news media. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(A) The term of the refunding bonds shall not extend beyond the final maturity date of the bonds being refunded; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The rate of interest borne by the refunding bonds shall not exceed the rate of interest borne by the bonds being refunded; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) The principal amount of the refunding bonds may only exceed the principal amount of the bonds being refunded to the extent necessary to effectuate a refund and to allow the reduction of the total principal and interest requirements over the remaining term of the bonds being refunded; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(D) The proceeds derived from the sale of the refunding bonds, together with the earnings and increments derived therefrom, if any, will be sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of, interest, and premium, if any, on the bonds being refunded and shall be deposited in an irrevocable trust fund created for that purpose. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Such refunding bonds so authorized to be issued in compliance with the conditions set forth above, when issued, shall be construed and deemed to be issued in lieu of such original debt being so refunded, and the original debt upon the creation of the irrevocable trust fund and the deposit of the requisite proceeds shall not constitute a debt within the meaning of Article IX, Section V, Paragraph I of the Constitution of Georgia, but the refunding bonds shall constitute a debt within the meaning of Article IX, Section V, Paragraph I of the Constitution of Georgia and shall count against the limitation on debt measured by the 10 percent of assessed value of taxable property as expressed therein. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any person who violates this Code section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; provided, however, nothing contained in this Code section shall be construed so that a violation thereof shall affect the validity of any bonds issued under this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Section must be strictly complied with.</b> - In order to render election legal, provisions of this section must be strictly complied with. Bowen v. Mayor of Greenesboro, 79 Ga. 709, 4 S.E. 159 (1887); Mayor of Athens v. Hemerick, 89 Ga. 674, 16 S.E. 72 (1892); Ponder v. Mayor of Forsyth, 96 Ga. 572, 23 S.E. 498 (1895); Smith v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Election not invalid because of disregard of directory provisions.</b> - Bond election should not be declared invalid on account of a disregard of merely directory provisions of election laws when such would not render an election for municipal officers invalid. Brumby v. City of Marietta, 132 Ga. 408, 64 S.E. 321 (1909).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Section 9-13-141 does not affect this section.</b> - Former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 5458 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-13-141), relating to the publication of notices of sales and orders by certain public officers and others, did not repeal or modify that portion of former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 377 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-1), which required that notice of an election called for the purpose of determining whether bonds shall be issued by a county shall be published for a space of 30 days next preceding the day of the election.

<p class="p6"><b>Denial by election to issue school bonds</b> does not impair right of taxation. Ayers v. McCalla, 95 Ga. 555, 22 S.E. 295 (1895).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>County has no authority to enter into executory contract.</b> - There is no authority of law for a county to enter into an executory contract for the sale of bonds which, at the time of the contract, the county is not authorized to issue. For a breach of such an undertaking an action for damages will not lie against the county. Robinson-Humphrey Co. v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Unnecessary to publish authority of mayor to call election.</b> - It is not necessary to publish the ordinance, or resolution, by which the mayor was authorized to order an election to be held upon the question whether or not such bonds should be issued, provided the notice required by law was duly published. Heilbron v. Mayor of Cuthbert, 96 Ga. 312, 23 S.E. 206 (1895).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When separate submissions required.</b> - If it can be said that the proposed improvements are not naturally related or connected, then it is clear that separate submissions are required; if, on the other hand, the several parts of the project are plainly so related that, united, the parts form but one rounded whole, it is equally clear that the parts may be grouped together and submitted as one proposition.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Requirements as to notice mandatory.</b> - Law requiring notice to be given in a certain way is mandatory, and a failure to comply with the law vitiates the election, if objection is raised at the proper time and in the proper way. Irvin v. Gregory, 86 Ga. 605, 13 S.E. 120 (1891); Davis v. Dougherty County, 116 Ga. 491, 42 S.E. 764 (1902).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to use explicit language treated as irregularity.</b> - Though the notice of the election provided for by an Act may not be in the clearest and most unequivocal terms, when the terms of the notice were such as to show that the question was necessarily to be passed upon in the election, the failure to use more explicit language in this respect (the notice as to all other matters being sufficient) will, after the election has taken place and after the bonds, in pursuance of its result, have been issued and sold and the bonds' proceeds applied as required by the Act, be treated as a mere irregularity not invalidating the bonds, and one of which it is too late for a taxpayer who participated in the election and who had knowledge of all the facts to complain. Brand v. Town of Lawrenceville, 104 Ga. 486, 30 S.E. 954 (1898).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Inadvertently omitting last publication treated as mere irregularity.</b> - When the advertisement prescribed was published once a week for four weeks, and the last publication was inadvertently omitted but the other three were duly made, the omission may be treated as a mere irregularity, if more than two-thirds of the qualified voters actually voted, and if the result has been acquiesced in until after action has been taken on the faith thereof by which substantial rights have arisen. Irvin v. Gregory, 86 Ga. 605, 13 S.E. 120 (1891).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Ordinance not meeting requirements of this section void.</b> - If notice be given under an ordinance prescribing the items of the notice and the ordinance does not meet the requirements set forth in this section, both the ordinance and the notice are void and of no effect. Wilkins v. City of Waynesboro, 116 Ga. 359, 42 S.E. 767 (1902); Shinall v. City of Cartersville, 144 Ga. 219, 87 S.E. 290 (1915); Scott Sch. Dist. v. Carter, 28 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>Amount of bonds to be issued and for what purpose.</b> - Notice which provides that a given amount should be used for the purpose of building a school, and another amount for the improvement of the water plant, and the surplus, if any, to be used by the mayor and council in such a manner as the mayor and council might see fit, does not meet the legal requirements of a notice which shall specify "what amount of bonds are to be issued, and for what purpose." Smith v. Mayor of Dublin, 113 Ga. 833, 39 S.E. 327 (1901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Need to state amount of debt to be incurred.</b> - Even if no legislation is necessary to authorize a municipal corporation to hold an election to determine whether a debt other than a bonded indebtedness shall be incurred, an election held pursuant to an ordinance and notice which does not state the amount of the debt to be incurred will not be sufficient to authorize the execution of a contract incurring an indebtedness. City Council v. Dawson Waterworks Co., 106 Ga. 696, 32 S.E. 907 (1899).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Degree of specificity of bond purpose.</b> - When the order and notice of election stated that the proceeds were used in improving and constructing the public roads on a certain county naming the roads to be improved and the order in which the roads were to be worked, such statement is sufficient under this section requiring that the purpose for which the bonds were to be issued should be stated. Moody v. Board of Comm'rs, 29 Ga. App. 21, 113 S.E. 103 (1922). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Notice of bond election was not subject to the criticism that the notice indicated that the bonds were to be voted for the purpose of providing funds for two or more distinct purposes, when the purposes stated were all related to providing additions and improvements to school facilities in the county. Miles v. State, 96 Ga. App. 610, 101 S.E.2d 173 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Publication in paper used by sheriff.</b> - Notice of election for issuance of bonds must be in paper in which sheriff publishes the sheriff's advertisements. Coffee v. Ragsdale, 112 Ga. 705, 37 S.E. 968 (1901); Scott Sch. Dist. v. Carter, 28 Ga. App. 412, 111 S.E. 216, cert. denied, 28 Ga. App. 819 (1922).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Requirement of publication for 30 days.</b> - If the publication was made only twice, on January 21 and February 4, and the election was held on February 5, this was not a compliance with the requirements of the law. Bowen v. Mayor of Greenesboro, 79 Ga. 709, 4 S.E. 159 (1887). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When it appeared that an election was held on Saturday, January 23, and that notice thereof had been published in the proper newspaper once a week for six weeks, beginning on Friday, December 18, and ending on Friday, January 22, since the notice was inserted the first time at least 30 days before the date of the election and as nearly that precise number of days immediately preceding such date as was possible under the circumstances, the fact that the publication began more than 30 days prior to such date was immaterial and afforded taxpayers no cause for attacking the validity of the notice. Clark v. Union Sch. Dist., 36 Ga. App. 80, 135 S.E. 318 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Publication of Act does not comply with requirements as to notice.</b> - Fact that a local Act was published before the day of the election, and that the notice prescribed the amount of the bonds, the interest thereon, and when the bonds were to be paid off, was not a sufficient compliance with this section; nor was the fact that, out of 189 voters, only 17 voted against the measure, a sufficient answer to the illegality of the notice.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice affecting custodian of funds.</b> - Bank as custodian of the proceeds of county bonds is chargeable with the notice given under this section as to the purpose of the bond issue and must not permit the funds to be used for other purposes. Bank of Chatsworth v. Hagedorn Constr. Co., 162 Ga. 488, 134 S.E. 310 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Reduction of amount before validation.</b> - When the election was regular as to all the requirements except that the amount exceeded the constitutional limit, the judge erred in reducing the amount of the bonds issued to a sum within such limit and then declaring the issuance of such bonds would be allowed. Berrien County v. Paulk, 150 Ga. 829, 105 S.E. 491 (1920).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>When petition did not present question whether notice was illegal</b> because amount was unconstitutional, injunction would not lie to restrain the authorities from issuing a less and proper amount.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Amount of interest.</b> - Specifying that interest is to be paid annually is not sufficient; failure to specify the amount to be paid renders the notice defective. Mayor of Athens v. Hemerick, 89 Ga. 674, 16 S.E. 72 (1892); Mayor of Perry v. Norwood, 99 Ga. 300, 25 S.E. 648 (1896); City of Thomasville v. Thomasville Elec. Light &amp; Gas Co., 122 Ga. 399, 50 S.E. 169 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Exact gross sum of interest not necessary.</b> - It is not essential to the validity of the notice that the notice should state the precise gross sum, in dollars and cents, to be annually paid as interest; the facts actually stated furnishing a basis by which a calculation could be easily and readily made showing the exact amount of interest to be paid. Ponder v. Mayor of Forsyth, 96 Ga. 572, 23 S.E. 498 (1895).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice need not specify price of bonds.</b> - Notice is not invalid because the price at which the bonds are to be sold is not stated therein. Wimberly v. County of Twiggs, 116 Ga. 50, 42 S.E. 478 (1902).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice silent as to collection of annual tax.</b> - Fact that the notice of the bond election was silent as to the collection of the annual tax affords no reason why the bonds should not be validated. Woodall v. Town of Adel, 122 Ga. 301, 50 S.E. 102 (1905); Oliver v. City of Elberton, 124 Ga. 64, 52 S.E. 15 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Advertisement taken as best evidence of intentions of fund use.</b> - Advertisement, a copy of which was attached to a petition as an exhibit, was the best evidence of the intention of the school board with respect to the use of the bond funds. In the absence of allegations of facts showing that the board had a secret, undisclosed intention to use the funds for some purpose other than that indicated by the advertisement or facts showing the deliberate perpetration of a fraud on the voters by the board, this advertisement must be taken as the best evidence of the board's intention with respect to the use of these funds.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Special law not void when the law merely prescribes additional requirements.</b> - Special law which is void is one in conflict with a general law, and not one in harmony with the special and prescribing additional matters in regard to the election not in conflict with the general law. A special law providing that notice be published in an official gazette is construed in regard as to the general law as to what notice should contain. Farmer v.

Accordingly, all proceeds generated at closing of the refunding issue should be spent on the costs of the refunding or used to pay principal, interest, and premiums on the refunded debt. Furthermore, a new tax levy appropriately sized to retire the new refunding bonds should be provided for prior to issuance of the refunding bonds. If any excess proceeds result from the new tax levy, such excess proceeds shall not be available for transfer to capital projects until all refundings are repaid. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen.

<p class="p6"><b>This section is not unconstitutional</b> on the ground that it makes no provision for a trial by jury in reference to the matters for the investigation of which provision is therein made. Lippitt v. City of Albany, 131 Ga. 629, 63 S.E. 33 (1908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This section is not unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute deprives citizens of property without due process of law by excluding further investigation as to validity of the bonds after judgment of confirmation and validation. Lippitt v. City of Albany, 131 Ga. 629, 63 S.E. 33 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>This section does not violate Ga. Const. 1877, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. I</b> (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. V, Para. I), as there is no merit in the contention that the statute seeks to confer power to incur debts without the consent of two-thirds (now majority) of the voters by the authorizing of confirmation bonds which have not received the required vote. Lippitt v. City of Albany, 131 Ga. 629, 63 S.E. 33 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Limited unconstitutionality.</b> - Insofar as former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 445 et seq. (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-20 et seq.), authorized the judge of the superior court to hear and determine the proceeding in a county other than that so fixed by the Constitution, the statute was invalid and must yield to the constitutional requirement on that subject. Ray v. City of Lavonia, 141 Ga. 626, 81 S.E. 884 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality</b> - When the constitutionality of former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 445 et seq. (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-20 et seq.) was not raised in a lower court, it was not considered in the Supreme Court. Edwards v. Town of Guyton, 140 Ga. 553, 79 S.E. 195 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - Purpose of this section is to provide a method by which it should be judicially investigated and determined whether the law, constitutional and statutory, has been complied with, so as to declare bonds referred to therein valid before their issuance. Lippitt v. City of Albany, 131 Ga. 629, 63 S.E. 33 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Provisions of this section are mandatory</b> and must be strictly complied with. State v. Chatham County, 103 Ga. App. 390, 119 S.E.2d 120 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Validation upon substantial compliance.</b> - When the record discloses the fact that all the requirements in relation to notice and providing for an election to determine whether bonds should be issued were either literally or substantially complied with, judgment validating such bonds is affirmed. Wimberly v. County of Twiggs, 116 Ga. 50, 42 S.E. 478 (1902).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Absence of payment provision.</b> - It is not incumbent upon the court to inquire into the question as to whether provision for payment has been made in conformity with the requirements of the Constitution. The bonds are not to be issued until after they are validated. If nothing appears as to what provision is to be made with reference to payment of the bonds, it will be presumed that if provision has not already been made it will be made in accordance with the Constitution and laws. Wilkins v. City of Waynesboro, 116 Ga. 359, 42 S.E. 767 (1902); Oliver v. City of Elberton, 124 Ga. 64, 52 S.E. 15 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No validation if payment unlawful.</b> - If when the application is made to validate the issue of bonds it appears to the judge, either from the pleadings or otherwise, that the authorities of the municipality or county do not intend to make provision for the payment of the bonds in the manner required by the Constitution, the judge should not render a judgment validating the issue of bonds. Wilkins v. City of Waynesboro, 116 Ga. 359, 42 S.E. 767 (1902); Oliver v. City of Elberton, 124 Ga. 64, 52 S.E. 15 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice should be served as required by statute.</b> - Notice which this section requires to be given to the solicitor general (now district attorney) by the officers charged by law with the duty of declaring the result of an election held by any county, municipality, or division for the purpose of incurring any bonded indebtedness as therein provided, must be served upon the solicitor general (now district attorney) in the manner therein prescribed and within the time therein specified, and should notify the solicitor general (now district attorney) that an election for the issuance of bonds was held in the county, municipality, or division, and that the election was in favor of the issuance of such bonds; and it is not necessary to the validity of such notice that a copy of the resolution authorizing the election be incorporated in the notice or attached thereto. Rich v. Brinson Consol. Sch. Dist., 28 Ga. App. 530, 112 S.E. 164, cert. denied, 28 Ga. App. 819 (1922).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When notice properly served, bonds should be validated.</b> - When a notice of an election held for the purpose of incurring a bonded indebtedness was properly served upon the solicitor general (now district attorney) and gave to that officer the necessary notice required by law, and had attached thereto what purported to be a true and correct copy of the resolution passed by the proper authorities ordering the election, and which copy was referred to in the notice given to the solicitor general (now district attorney), it was not error, upon the hearing of an intervention to the proceeding to validate the bonds authorized by the election, for the trial judge, over the objection of the intervenors, to allow the officers giving the notice to amend the notice by withdrawing or striking the attached copy of the resolution authorizing the election and substituting in lieu thereof another copy, alleged to be a true and correct copy of the resolution authorizing the election. Rich v. Brinson Consol. Sch. Dist., 28 Ga. App. 530, 112 S.E. 164, cert. denied, 28 Ga. App. 819 (1922).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Single proceeding may be had to validate several series of bonds.</b> - When there are three series of bonds to be issued, each for a separate purpose, a single proceeding may be maintained to validate the bonds, the items being submitted separately. Sewell v. City of Tallapoosa, 145 Ga. 19, 88 S.E. 577 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bonds may be valid notwithstanding refusal to validate.</b> - Judgment refusing to validate bonds not being based on the invalidity of the bonds is not the equivalent of a judgment declaring the bonds illegal. Bonds may be valid and binding notwithstanding a refusal of the court to confirm and validate. Tyson v. McIntosh County, 147 Ga. 233, 93 S.E. 407 (1917); Harrell v. Whigham, 147 Ga. 558, 94 S.E. 994 (1918).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Fact that judgment of validation void has no effect on bonds legally issued.</b> - Even if the proceedings to validate bonds were void, the sale of the bonds issued in conformity with former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 441 et seq. (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 36-82-2 et seq. and 36-82-20), would not be enjoined merely because the judgment of validation was void. Durrence v. City of Statesboro, 147 Ga. 175, 93 S.E. 88 (1917); Tyson v. McIntosh County, 147 Ga. 233, 93 S.E. 407 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Extent of power of superior court.</b> - In a proceeding to validate bonds, it is within the power and jurisdiction of the superior court upon proper pleadings and sufficient evidence, to pass upon the validity of any votes cast in the election, and to eliminate such votes as are shown by the pleadings and the evidence to be illegal. King v. County Bd. of Educ., 174 Ga. 685, 164 S.E. 52 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Unlawful use of bonds.</b> - Fact that the city may intend to use the proceeds of the bonds in an unlawful manner, the bonds being voted for a lawful purpose, is not a ground for refusing to validate. Gracen v. Mayor of Savannah, 142 Ga. 141, 82 S.E. 453 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Refusal of validation no remedy for unlawful use of proceeds.</b> - If the public authorities should seek to use in an unlawful manner, or for an unlawful purpose, the proceeds of the bonds thus authorized, the remedy is not by a refusal to validate the bonds for the purpose for which the bonds were authorized. Lilly v. Crisp County Sch. Sys., 117 Ga. App. 868, 162 S.E.2d 456 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Validation not collusive because uncontested.</b> - Validation is not held to be collusive because the validation is uncontested for a complaining citizen has the right to become a party and contest the validation. Farmer v. Mayor of Thomson, 133 Ga. 94, 65 S.E. 180 (1909).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>There is no law which would prevent any party to proceeding from introducing evidence which would establish existence of facts necessary to validation of bonds.</b> Lilly v. Crisp County Sch. Sys., 117 Ga. App. 868, 162 S.E.2d 456 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Rights of taxpayers who failed to make themselves parties.</b> - When an election, held to determine whether municipal bonds should be issued, resulted in favor of such issuance, and the bonds were duly validated in accordance with these provisions, the citizens and taxpayers who could have made themselves parties to the proceedings to validate the bonds, but failed to do so, were concluded by the judgment rendered, and could not thereafter enjoin the collection of a tax to pay the interest and part of the principal falling due, on the ground that some of the bonds were for a purpose not authorized by the Constitution.

<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Provision for time of hearing directory.</b> - Provision of this section, which prescribes the time within which the judge of the superior court shall fix the hearing on the petition to validate an issue of municipal bonds, and the time within which the judge shall hear and determine the same is directory only. Spencer v. City of Columbus, 150 Ga. 312, 103 S.E. 464 (1920); Perkins v. Norristown (42) Sch. Dist., 151 Ga. 414, 107 S.E. 42 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Provision as to time of filing petition mandatory.</b> - Provision requiring the solicitor general (now district attorney) to file the petition within 20 days from date of service upon the solicitor general (now district attorney) was not merely directory, but mandatory. Roff v. Town of Calhoun, 110 Ga. 806, 36 S.E. 214 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No right to file petition after 20 days.</b> - Solicitor general (now district attorney) has no authority, after the expiration of 20 days from the date of the service upon the solicitor general (now district attorney) of the notice provided for by Ga. L. 1987, p. 82, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-20), relating to "the confirming and validating of" bonds, to file the petition prescribed by Ga. L. 1987, p. 82, <span class="s1">§</span> 2 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-21), and such a petition, if filed too late, cannot be made the basis of any valid judicial action. Roff v. Town of Calhoun, 110 Ga. 806, 36 S.E. 214 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sufficiency of petition.</b> - It is necessary, of course, to state the facts, and this should be done with sufficient particularity to meet the requirements of good pleading. A petition which fails to show, except by a bare conclusion, that the election resulted prima facie in favor of the issuance of the bonds is fatally defective and subject to general demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Edwards v. City of Clarkesville, 35 Ga. App. 306, 133 S.E. 45 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Necessary elements in petition.</b> - Petition to validate bonds must show that an election was held pursuant to the provisions of Article 1 of this chapter and that the result of the election was prima facie in favor of issuance of the bonds. Lilly v. Crisp County Sch. Sys., 117 Ga. App. 868, 162 S.E.2d 456 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Unnecessary allegations.</b> - Petition need not set out any details relating to the required number of voters. Spencer v. City of Clarkesville, 129 Ga. 627, 59 S.E. 274 (1907); Davis v. Orland Consol. Sch. Dist., 152 Ga. 76, 108 S.E. 466 (1921). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This section does not require that petition should allege that amount of bonds is within constitutional limitation as to the debt to be incurred by a municipal corporation or political division. Such matter, however, may be urged by an intervenor on the trial. If the intervenor should urge such matter, the burden is upon the intervenor to plead and prove the matter. Sewell v. City of Tallapoosa, 145 Ga. 19, 88 S.E. 577 (1916). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">It is not necessary that a list of voters and tally sheets of an election should be set out in or attached to a petition. Stephens v. School Dist. No. 3, 154 Ga. 275, 114 S.E. 197 (1922). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Law does not require an allegation as to publication of the notice to the voters, or as to the furnishing of the list of the registered voters (it being sufficient merely to show the number of such voters), or as to the city's indebtedness not exceeding the limit allowed by the Constitution. Edwards v. City of Clarkesville, 35 Ga. App. 306, 133 S.E. 45 (1926). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Proceeding, brought by a solicitor general (now district attorney) to validate bonds to be issued by a school district in a county of this state, need only allege facts to meet the requirements of this section and it is therefore unnecessary that the solicitor general (now district attorney) allege that the school district was one "in which a local tax is now or may hereafter be levied for school purposes," or is a school district "in a county now levying a local tax." These matters are matters of defense to the validation proceeding. Hardrick v. State, 53 Ga. App. 299, 185 S.E. 577 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Misnomer of the municipality in petition</b> to validate bonds does not vitiate judgment of confirmation, when it appears that the officers of the municipality acknowledged service of the petition and answered the petition under oath in its true corporate name, and the judgment of validation also sets forth the proper corporate name of the municipality. Rhodes v. City of Louisville, 121 Ga. 551, 49 S.E. 681 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Omission of statement of principal and interest from petition.</b> - When the petition under this section omitted to state how much principal and interest was to be paid annually and when the bonds were to be paid in full, but no objection was made in that proceeding to the sufficiency of the petition, and attached to the answer of the city as an exhibit was a copy of the ordinance providing for the issuance of the bonds, which showed the facts referred to above, so that it appeared from the record that provision on that subject was made, after judgment of validation the omission of the allegation above mentioned from the petition of the solicitor general (now district attorney) will not serve to render the entire proceeding void, or to authorize an injunction to prevent the payment of the bonds. Thomas v. City of Blakely, 141 Ga. 488, 81 S.E. 218 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Issuance of order prior to filing petition.</b> - Provisions of this section are satisfied if the notice is served and the petition is filed and the order nisi obtained within the several times specified, notwithstanding the issuance of the order nisi may have preceded the filing of the petition in the office of the clerk of the superior court. Durrence v. City of Statesboro, 147 Ga. 175, 93 S.E. 88 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Validation within jurisdiction of superior court.</b> - Proceeding to validate bonds embraces justiciable questions within the jurisdiction of the superior court. Lilly v. Crisp County Sch. Sys., 117 Ga. App. 868, 162 S.E.2d 456 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Venue in county in which bonds are situated.</b> - Venue of a statutory proceeding to validate municipal bonds is in the county in which the bonds are situated. Ray v. City of Lavonia, 141 Ga. 626, 81 S.E. 884 (1914); Murray v. City of Tifton, 143 Ga. 301, 84 S.E. 967 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Fixing of hearing in another county of circuit.</b> - Under the provision of this section, touching the validation of bonds, that, on due application, the judge of the superior court shall require the proper officers to show cause, "at such time and place . . . as the judge of said court may direct, why said bonds should not be confirmed and validated," it was held that the fixing, by the judge, of the place for the hearing in another county of the judicial circuit than that where the election was held was not beyond the terms of the Act. Farmer v. Mayor of Thomson, 133 Ga. 94, 65 S.E. 180 (1909).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Hearing on day not named in notice.</b> - When, prior to the hearing of a proceeding for the validation of county bonds under the provisions of this section the required statutory publication giving notice of the date of hearing has been duly made, the fact that the hearing was had before the judge on a day other than that named in the published notice does not render the judgment illegal, when it further appears that the case was regularly continued by the court from the day named in the publication to the day on which the hearing was had. Wimberly v. County of Twiggs, 116 Ga. 50, 42 S.E. 478 (1902); Moody v. Board of Comm'rs, 29 Ga. App. 21, 113 S.E. 103 (1922).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>By whom notice given.</b> - Petition was not subject to demurrer (now motion to dismiss) because the notice to the solicitor general (now district attorney) was not given by the proper officer. This notice must be given by the officer or officers charged with declaring the result of the election. Stephens v. School Dist. No. 3, 154 Ga. 275, 114 S.E. 197 (1922).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Burden of proof in action to validate bonds.</b> - It was incumbent upon the petitioner in an action to validate bonds to make out a prima facie case by proving each of the substantial and material allegations set forth in former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 445 and 446 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 36-82-20 and 36-82-21) as necessary allegations of the petition. When this was done the burden was cast upon the defendant, or upon a proper party as intervenor, to set up and establish any other fact which by aliunde proof would render the bond election invalid. King v. County Bd. of Educ., 42 Ga. App. 563, 156 S.E. 710 (1931), aff'd by operation of law, 174 Ga. 685, 164 S.E. 52 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Burden is on state to prove material facts</b> which are requisite to obtain validation. Lilly v. Crisp County Sch. Sys., 117 Ga. App. 868, 162 S.E.2d 456 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When unqualified trustees act as de facto officers.</b> - When a school district is divided by the board of education of the county by proper resolution, and no new trustees are elected or qualified for that district from which another district is created, but the trustees of the original district continue to act therefor, and call an election for the purpose of determining whether bonds will be issued for the purpose of building and equipping a schoolhouse, and the election results in favor of the bonds, and the trustees give the proper notice to the solicitor (now district attorney), the trustees are acting in the matter as de facto officers and the trustees' acts cannot be attacked as null and void in the proceeding to validate the bonds.

<p class="p6"><b>Proper date to present objection to validation.</b> - When a judge fixed a certain date as the day for the hearing on the question of validating a proposed bond issue, and for providential reasons failed to hold court on that day but recessed it until four days later, and upon calling the case on this date a qualified objector presented an objection, it was error to refuse to allow such otherwise qualified objector to present such objections merely because the objector had not presented the objections on the date originally fixed for the hearing.

<p class="p6"><b>Burden on state to prove material facts.</b> - When statutory proceedings were brought for the purpose of validating bonds under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 446 and 447 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 36-82-21 and 36-82-23), and were contested by citizens who became parties thereto and deny the truth of the substantial allegations of the petition, the burden was on the state to prove the material facts which were requisite to obtain validation. Harrell v. Town of Whigham, 141 Ga. 322, 80 S.E. 1010 (1914); Stephens v. School Dist. No. 3, 154 Ga. 275, 114 S.E. 197 (1922); Moody v. Board of Comm'rs, 29 Ga. App. 21, 113 S.E. 103 (1922); Clay v. Austell Sch. Dist., 35 Ga. App. 109, 132 S.E. 127 (1926). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Burden of proof on state even when solicitor general (now district attorney) alleges facts sufficient to warrant validation of bonds and answers filed by defendant admits facts alleged.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Final judgment prerequisite to bill of exceptions.</b> - When an answer filed by intervenors is dismissed as being insufficient to prevent validation, but the order of dismissal provides merely that the petitioners "may take an order confirming and validating," it does not constitute a final judgment confirming and validating the issuance of the bonds from which a bill of exceptions will lie as provided by this section. Veal v. Deepstep Consol. Sch. Dist., 34 Ga. App. 67, 128 S.E. 223 (1925).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Proper date to present objection to validation.</b> - When a judge fixed a certain date as the day for the hearing on the question of validating a proposed bond issue, and for providential reasons failed to hold court on that day but recessed the court until four days later, and upon calling the case on this date a qualified objector presented an objection, it was error to refuse to allow such otherwise qualified objector to present the objections merely because the objector had not presented the objection on the date originally fixed for the hearing. Horton v. Downs Consol. Sch. Dist., 59 Ga. App. 77, 200 S.E. 469 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Petition that judgment be reopened.</b> - When, upon a petition duly filed praying for the validation of certain county bonds, all the proceedings appeared on their face to have been regular, including the notice provided for by law, and the court rendered a judgment validating the bonds, and, 16 days thereafter and after the court had adjourned, certain persons filed a petition merely alleging that the people were taxpayers and asking that the order validating the bonds be vacated or reopened, and that the people be heard on the question as to the regularity or irregularity of the election held to authorize the bonds, the court did not err in dismissing the petition, on the ground that it came too late. Ballard v. Morgan County, 24 Ga. App. 371, 100 S.E. 763 (1919).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Injunction refused when writ of error not timely.</b> - After the validation of certain municipal bonds, no writ of error to the judgment validating the bonds having been sued out within the time prescribed by law, it was not error for the court below to refuse to enjoin the issuance of those bonds. Holton v. City of Camilla, 134 Ga. 560, 68 S.E. 472 (1910); Edwards v. Town of Guyton, 140 Ga. 553, 79 S.E. 195 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Assigning error as to amount.</b> - Intervenors cannot for the first time, in their bill of exceptions, successfully assign error to the judgment on the ground that it did not affirmatively appear that the proposed bond issue was within the constitutional limitation of amount. Sewell v. City of Tallapoosa, 145 Ga. 19, 88 S.E. 577 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Judgment conforms to pleading when judgment contains same recitals.</b> - Judgment validating bonds conformed to the pleadings upon which based, when the judgment contained the same recitals as pleadings as to character and amount of bonds raised. Sewell v. City of Tallapoosa, 145 Ga. 19, 88 S.E. 577 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sufficiency of allegations of fraud.</b> - When it does not appear that the county attorney made any misrepresentation as to any fact or facts concerning the hearing, or the postponement thereof, or waived the filing of any objections, or promised to continue the hearing, and it appearing from the petition that the petitioners knew of the time legally set for the validation proceeding, and the only conclusion to be drawn being that through their laches and negligence the petitioners failed to file objections, the petition does not allege facts sufficient to show such fraud as would warrant the setting aside of the judgment.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Courts bound by constitutional provision.</b> - Under Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I), the grant of such broad powers to municipalities as are contained in the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) is authorized, and by that the courts are bound and have nothing to do with the reasonableness, wisdom, policy, or expediency of the law. Lipscomb v. Cumming, 211 Ga. 55, 84 S.E.2d 3 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Issuance of bonds not unconstitutional.</b> - When it appeared that revenue anticipation bonds were to be issued by a town for improvement of waterworks under the authority and in accordance with the method prescribed by Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I), and the laws incorporated therein by reference thereto, the proposed issuance of the revenue anticipation bonds, the proceeding for validation, and the judgment of validation were not contrary to any provisions of the Constitution. Thigpen v. Town of Davisboro, 81 Ga. App. 610, 59 S.E.2d 522 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Acts restricting rights granted under article inoperative.</b> - Since the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36), adopted in Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I), is a part of the charter of every municipality, any acts of the General Assembly tending to restrict the power of a municipality to exercise rights granted thereunder are inoperative for this purpose. Carter v. State, 93 Ga. App. 12, 90 S.E.2d 672 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) sets out general law</b> by which counties, municipalities, and other political subdivisions may raise revenue for projects contemplated. Carter v. State, 93 Ga. App. 12, 90 S.E.2d 672 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) does not purport to be general law exhaustive</b> of purposes for which revenue bonds or certificates may be issued and this is not violative of the Constitutional provision that laws of a general nature shall have uniform operation throughout the state, and no special law shall be enacted in any case for which provisions have been made by an existing general law (Ga. Const. 1945, Art. I, Sec. IV, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I)). Sigman v. Brunswick Port Auth., 214 Ga. 332, 104 S.E.2d 467 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of contradictory local legislation.</b> - General Assembly intended that every municipality should have exactly the same power to do all of the acts authorized by the Revenue Bond Law of 1937 (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) as adopted by Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I), and the constitutional provisions being a part of the charter of a municipality, it necessarily follows that it has the authority to proceed thereunder regardless of other and alternate, or even contradictory, plans which might have been contained in local legislation. Carter v. State, 93 Ga. App. 12, 90 S.E.2d 672 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article is part of municipal charter.</b> - When the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) and the Constitution of 1945 were adopted, the provisions of each as to revenue bonds became a part of the charter of every municipality. Lipscomb v. Cumming, 211 Ga. 55, 84 S.E.2d 3 (1954); Carter v. State, 93 Ga. App. 12, 90 S.E.2d 672 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Certificates not debts within constitutional limitations.</b> - Revenue anticipation bonds issued under the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) do not subject the political subdivision issuing the bonds to any pecuniary liability thereon and are, therefore, not debts against such political subdivision within the meaning of the constitutional provision limiting such indebtedness (Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I)). Fort Oglethorpe v. Catoosa County, 80 Ga. App. 188, 55 S.E.2d 753 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) is designed to provide for self-liquidating projects</b> and revenue bonds therein contemplated are not to be a charge against the general credit of the county or municipality. The liability is to be satisfied only from revenues produced by the undertaking and, under the specific terms of the statute, the political division will never be required to aid in its retirement with funds derived from any other source, and is in fact prohibited from doing so. Reed v. City of Smyrna, 201 Ga. 228, 39 S.E.2d 668 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Origin of funds as affecting public or private status.</b> - Fact that the funds proposed to be used are to be derived from the sale of revenue anticipation bonds does not deprive the funds of the character of "public funds," use of which for private purpose or enterprise is prohibited. Beazley v. De Kalb County, 210 Ga. 41, 77 S.E.2d 740 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Creation of water district and system outside city approved.</b> - Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) defines a "municipality" (now "governmental body") to be any county, city, or town. It authorizes any such municipality to create a water district and to construct, operate, and maintain a water system which may be located wholly within or wholly without the municipality, or partially within and partially without the municipality. City of Trenton v. Dade County, 75 Ga. App. 326, 43 S.E.2d 432 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>No cause of action to enjoin city from furnishing water outside city limits.</b> - Petition which seeks to enjoin city from constructing a water line and furnishing water to customers because the customers are located outside the corporate limits of the city fails to state a cause of action.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bonds issued to extend existing system of improvements approved.</b> - Under the provisions of the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) and the constitutional sanction thereof (Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I)), revenue anticipation bonds may be issued by a municipality to extend an existing system of municipal improvements by pledging the entire revenue of the whole system to the payment thereof, subject to the rights of holders of prior issues, without prorating the values of the existing and the new facilities, and pledging only the revenue of such new facilities according to their proportion to the total value.

<p class="p6"><b>Issuing certificates for construction of warehouse not authorized.</b> - Under the restrictive provisions of Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I), that governmental subdivisions of the state shall issue revenue anticipation bonds only to provide funds for such facilities and undertakings as are "specifically authorized and enumerated" by Acts there referred to, a county is not authorized to issue such revenue bonds for the acquisition or construction and equipping of warehouses to be used in the conduct of a general storage warehouse business, which is ordinarily carried on by private enterprise. Such an undertaking is not properly included within the definition of the word "terminal" as used in the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36), and not "specifically authorized and enumerated" therein. Beazley v. De Kalb County, 210 Ga. 41, 77 S.E.2d 740 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Procedure</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Superior rights not gained by prior proceeding to validate certificates.</b> - There is nothing contained in the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) which expressly or by necessary implication gives that municipality which institutes proceedings first for the validation of its bonds, and the confirmation of the security for the payment thereof, superior rights over another municipality which may file proceedings to validate and confirm the security for its bonds subsequently thereto; this is true although the two proposed districts may embrace the same area or portions of the same area. City of Trenton v. Dade County, 75 Ga. App. 326, 43 S.E.2d 432 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Conclusiveness of judgment validating revenue bonds.</b> - Judgment validating revenue bonds, unless excepted to within the time provided by law, is conclusive upon all questions made, or that might have been made, prior to the judgment of validation, including the constitutionality of the statute under which the proceedings are had. Dawson v. Hospital Auth., 212 Ga. 146, 91 S.E.2d 12 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Defect in service waived by appearance.</b> - When the mayor and counsel of a municipality appear, file an answer, and acknowledge service of a petition for validating revenue bonds, any defect in the service of the petition on the mayor and counsel is held to be waived by appearance and pleading. Dade County v. State, 75 Ga. App. 330, 43 S.E.2d 434 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Written notice by attorney on solicitor general (now district attorney) sufficient.</b> - When a municipality through the municipality's proper officers, under the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36), employs an attorney to guide and direct the municipality generally and to prepare proceedings for the purpose of validating revenue bonds, and such attorney prepares the resolution of the municipality and serves written notice of the passage of the resolution on the solicitor general (now district attorney), such will be deemed sufficient notice to the solicitor general (now district attorney).

<p class="p6"><b>Eminent domain beyond corporate city limits.</b> - Georgia municipalities have power of eminent domain, even beyond corporate city limits, for public works financed by revenue bonds. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipalities in business only to serve public welfare.</b> - In the absence of special circumstances, it is not within the constitutional power of a legislature to authorize a municipal corporation (county) to engage in a business which can be and ordinarily is carried on by private enterprise, merely for the purpose of obtaining an income or deriving a profit therefrom, but it should be allowed to go into business only on the theory that thereby the public welfare will be subserved. 1965-66 Op.

<p class="p6"><b>Athletic facilities approved.</b> - Under the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36), the county board of education could erect athletic fields, grandstands, and stadiums with revenue bonds to be retired solely from the usage of the fields, grandstands, and stadiums. 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 168.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Weight of advice of county attorney.</b> - Before a county board of education should undertake to create a debt under the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A.

<p class="p9"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - As applied to the establishment and maintenance of systems of waterworks by counties, the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) is not subject to attack on the ground that the law violates the constitutional provision that protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete. Nor does the Constitution otherwise prohibit the General Assembly from authorizing such an undertaking by counties. The court did not err in denying an interlocutory injunction. Miller v. Head, 186 Ga. 694, 198 S.E. 680 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Certificates not to be charged against general credit.</b> - Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) is designed to provide for self-liquidating projects and the revenue bonds therein contemplated are not to be a charge against the general credit of the county or municipality. The liability is to be satisfied only from revenues produced by the undertaking and under the specific terms of the statute, the political division will never be required to aid in its retirement with funds derived from any other source, and is in fact prohibited from doing so. The article is not unconstitutional by virtue of violating the constitutional limitation on municipal debts in Ga. Const. 1877, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. V, Para. I). Miller v. Head, 186 Ga. 694, 198 S.E. 680 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Construction of sewer system is clearly undertaking contemplated</b> under the Revenue Bond Law, O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36. Kelley v. City of Griffin, 257 Ga. 407, 359 S.E.2d 644 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Creation of water district and system outside city approved.</b> - Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) defines a "municipality" (now "governmental body") to be any county, city, or town of this state. It authorizes any such municipality to create a water district and to construct, operate, and maintain a water system which may be located wholly without the municipality, or partially within and partially without the municipality. City of Trenton v. Dade County, 75 Ga. App. 326, 43 S.E.2d 432 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Combining waterworks and sewage systems approved.</b> - Argument that the waterworks system is a proprietary and revenue-producing function, and that the sewage system is a governmental function, and for this reason the two cannot be combined into one system, notwithstanding any authority to do so under this section, is without merit. Under Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I), it is expressly provided that water systems and sewerage systems may be combined. Reed v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Word "terminal" as used in the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A.

<p class="p6"><b>County payments to airport authority's sinking fund as "revenue."</b> - Under a contract between county and airport authority for use by the county of an expanded airport facility, although the county's consideration would not be paid directly to the authority, but paid to the custodian of the authority's sinking fund, the consideration did not lose its character as "revenue" for the authority and such payment scheme was not a reason to deny validation of the authority's revenue bonds.

<p class="p6"><b>Application of section to buildings constructed for educational purposes.</b> - While counties are authorized to issue revenue bonds in paragraph (2) of this section, and while an "undertaking" is said to include buildings constructed for educational purposes under paragraph (4), both Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para. I) and this section require that the funds must be for a revenue-producing facility and that the obligations be paid only from revenue produced by this revenue-producing facility. 1954-56 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 222.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Housing for teachers not included.</b> - Since subparagraph (4)(E) contains no general language, despite the fact that reference is made to housing facilities for swine, cattle, etc., it does not include housing for teachers. Cattle, swine, and other domestic animals constitute only one type of personal property belonging to the school which would require housing no different than class room furniture or laboratory supplies and which would be used as an integral part of the educational operation, whereas the home or living quarters of a teacher would not fall in the same category. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 140.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>General phrase "other related facilities"</b> in subparagraph (4)(D) cannot be construed to include housing facilities for teachers. The specific subjects, i.e., "dormitories, laboratories, libraries," enumerated prior to the general phrase "other related facilities," all relate to facilities that constitute an integral part of the physical school properties for use by the students and public generally, whereas housing facilities would not be construed as a part of the school plant or for use by the public generally, notwithstanding the incidental public benefit to be derived therefrom in facilitating the employment of desirable teachers. 1958-59 Op.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Constitutionality of methods of repaying bonds.</b> - If a municipality desires, a municipality may pledge the entire revenue of existing facilities, along with the revenues from improvements made thereon with funds secured by the issuance of revenue anticipation bonds, to the payment of these certificates and the interest thereon, or the municipality may value the existing facilities, and by following the formula provided in this section, eliminate from the revenue pledged for payment of the bonds that revenue derived from existing facilities on which improvements were made. By the express terms of Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VII, Sec. VII, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. VI, Para.

Art. 3, Ch. 82, T. 36) gives power of eminent domain</b> to authorities such as the Clayton County Water Authority, duly created by act of the General Assembly, and there is no merit in the assertion that the condemnation of an easement for sewage lines over a person's land proceeded illegally because such authority is without authority to exercise the right of eminent domain. Johnston v. Clayton County Water Auth., 222 Ga. 39, 148 S.E.2d 417 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">While the act creating the Henry County Water and Sewerage Authority (HCWSA) did not expressly grant HCWSA the power of eminent domain, the act did grant the HCWSA the power to build and maintain water systems both within and without the limits of the county, and to join the governing authority in the issuance of revenue-anticipation certificates; accordingly, the HCWSA possessed the power of eminent domain as granted under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-62(a).

<p class="p6"><b>Section does not permit changes in contracts.</b> - In view of the fact that this section authorized municipalities and public authorities "to make all contracts" a court could not interpret this legislation as allowing changes in contracts except in accordance with the provisions contained in such agreements. Legally binding contracts must be honored. City of Jonesboro v. Clayton County Water Auth., 136 Ga. App. 768, 222 S.E.2d 76 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Power to collect fees independent.</b> - Power of cities and counties to collect fees, tolls, or other charges from undertakings such as causeways, parking meters, and other endeavors is clearly independent of power to issue revenue bonds, otherwise a county could not operate parking meters without a revenue bond issue and could not charge for meter parking after the bonds were paid.

<p class="p6">Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-62 is part of Georgia's Revenue Bond Law, the power to operate and maintain an undertaking and the power to collect fees or charges from undertakings are clearly independent of the power to issue revenue bonds.

I)), revenue anticipation bonds may be issued by a municipality to extend an existing system of municipal improvements by pledging the entire revenue of the whole system to the payment thereof, subject to the rights of holders of prior issues, without pro-rating the values of the existing and the new facilities and pledging only the revenue of such new facilities according to their proportion to the total value.

<p class="p11">The acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment, or extension of any undertaking and the issuance, in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such undertaking, of bonds to provide funds to pay the cost thereof, may be authorized under this article by resolution or resolutions of the governing body, which may be adopted at a regular or special meeting by a majority of the members of the governing body. Unless otherwise provided therein, such resolution or resolutions shall take effect immediately and need not be laid over or published or posted. The governing body, in determining such cost, may include all costs and estimated costs of the issuance of the bonds; all engineering, inspection, fiscal, and legal expenses; interest estimated to accrue during the construction period and for six months thereafter on money borrowed or which it is estimated will be borrowed pursuant to this article; and moneys not in excess of an amount equal to 15 percent of the total principal amount of each such bond issue, to establish a debt service reserve with respect to principal and interest requirements on the bonds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The contract was a valid intergovernmental contract and the consideration represented the authority's lawful "revenue pledged to the payment of" the bonds. Clayton County Airport Auth. v.

<p class="p6">Under a contract between county and airport authority for use by the county of an expanded airport facility, although the county's consideration would not be paid directly to the authority, but paid to the custodian of the authority's sinking fund, the consideration did not lose the consideration's character as "revenue" for the authority and such payment scheme was not a reason to deny validation of the authority's revenue bonds.

<p class="p6"><b>Generally, there can be but one action to validate</b> either certificates or bonds; in either case all interventions would be heard in the validation proceedings, and the allegation that a declaratory judgment is necessary to avoid a multiplicity of actions is a conclusion of the pleader, contrary to the statutory provisions pertaining to validation of revenue anticipation bonds.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Standing to challenge bond validation.</b> - Appeal filed by challengers to a trial court judgment confirming and validating a city's bond issuance was dismissed because the challengers failed to present any evidence to establish the challengers standing under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-77(a) to become parties in the bond validation proceeding; thus, the challengers lacked standing to appeal the judgment in that proceeding.

<p class="p6"><b>No right to jury trial.</b> - Bond validation proceeding is not one of class of cases, either in terms or by analogy, in which jury trials have ever existed as a matter of right; and it does not fall within Ga. Const. 1945, Art. VI, Sec. XVI, Para. I (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI). Steadham v. State, 224 Ga. 78, 159 S.E.2d 397, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 825, 89 S. Ct. 87, 21 L.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>State a necessary party in intervention in validation proceeding.</b> - On appeal by intervening taxpayers and citizens from a judgment of the superior court overruling their objections and validating the bonds, the state is a necessary and indispensable party, and, it appearing that the state had not been made a party to the bill of exceptions or served with a copy of the bill of exception, the writ of error is properly dismissed.

<p class="p6"><b>Notice and a hearing required before dismissal of intervention complaints.</b> - Trial court erred in dismissing a complaint by intervenors objecting to a bond validation proceeding without notice and a hearing on the dismissal issue, although the trial court found that the intervenors had intervened for the improper purpose of seeking $ 1.3 million from developers to avoid the litigation. Citizens for Ethics in Gov't, LLC v. Atlanta Dev. Auth., 303 Ga. App. 724, 694 S.E.2d 680 (2010), cert. denied, No. S10C1350, 2010 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bond approval not proper.</b> - Trial court erred by validating taxable revenue bonds for a county development authority as the order validating the bonds failed to set forth sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the court's holdings and, thus, failed to satisfy the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-52(a).

<p class="p6"><b>Remand to trial court for preparation of findings and conclusions.</b> - Judgment granting the state's petition to validate revenue bonds under the Revenue Bond Law, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-60 et seq., was remanded to the trial court because the trial court failed to mention in the judgment the citizen who intervened in the proceedings and to set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to various grounds pursued by the citizen as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-52(a); prior to the judgment, the citizen requested findings of fact and conclusions of law.

<p class="p6"><b>Validation upheld.</b> - After a trial court required two intervenors to post a bond of $625,000 with regard to the intervenors' challenge to the public improvement bond approved by a city's building authority for a sewer project, the trial court properly validated the bond by following all necessary procedural requirements and the bond did not violate Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. V, Para. I(a) since the city's payment for the use of the sewer project was a debt specifically authorized under the constitution pursuant to Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. III, Para. I(a). Berry v. City of E. Point, 277 Ga. App. 649, 627 S.E.2d 391 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Memorandum of agreement establishing valuation method part of lease agreement.</b> - Because a memorandum of agreement establishing the valuation methodology to be used in assessing ad valorem taxes on a leasehold estate was referenced by the lease and dictated the methodology to be used to value a corporation's leasehold estate for ad valorem tax purposes, it constituted an integral part of the lease agreement and was properly before the trial court; in a transaction in which revenue bonds will be paid through lease proceeds, all agreements relating to the lease are properly within the trial court's jurisdiction.

<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">The economic development and the availability of safe, sanitary, and affordable housing in the State of Georgia are of vital importance to the state and its citizens. Private activity bond financing has been an integral part of the state's program for economic development and affordable housing. The United States government has enacted a law which limits the availability of private activity bond financing within each state. This limited resource must be used in the best interest of the State of Georgia to the fullest extent permitted by federal law. The federal law limits the annual issuance of private activity bonds in the state to an amount not exceeding a state ceiling imposed under the federal law. The federal law not only provides for a distribution of the state ceiling but also provides that a state may by law provide for a different formula for allocating the state ceiling among the governmental units or other authorities in the state having authority to issue private activity bonds. The purpose of this article is to implement a system for allocating the use of private activity bonds, as permitted by federal law, in order to further the economic development of the state, to further the provision of safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, and otherwise to further the purposes of the laws of the state which provide for the issuance of such bonds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In many cases the consolidation of local government units or the consolidation of local government service delivery programs can lead to increased efficiency in the delivery of local government services, thereby providing either enhanced service delivery, lower levels of taxation, or both. In other cases, however, existing territorial systems for local government service delivery already operate in an efficient and cost-effective manner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Public notice of such request for proposal shall be made at least 90 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals by posting the legal notice on the websites of each participating local governing authority and local authority in substantially the same manner utilized by such authority to solicit requests for proposals, with a copy of such notice provided simultaneously to each affected local government. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) Upon receipt of a proposal or proposals responsive to the request for proposals, the lead local authority shall accept written public comment, solicited in the same manner as provided for notice of proposals, for a period of 30 days beginning at least ten days after the date set for receipt of proposals.

<p class="p11">(ii) Negotiations shall then be conducted by the designated representative with the selected respondents. A representative of any participating local governing authority, participating local authority, and participating state agency or authority shall have the right to notice of and participation in such negotiations. Negotiations conducted with selected respondents pursuant to this division shall not be public meetings subject to the provisions of Chapter 14 of Title 50. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(D) The designated representative shall select for approval by the lead local authority the respondent for project implementation based upon contract terms that are the most satisfactory and advantageous to the participating local governing authorities and local authorities based upon a thorough assessment of value and the ability of the final project's characteristics to meet the goals of the participating local governing authorities and local authorities, consistent with applicable state-wide and regional water plans and local comprehensive plans. Before making such selection, the designated representative shall consult in an open and public meeting subject to the provisions of Chapter 14 of Title 50 with the representatives of any participating local governing authority, participating local authority, participating state agency or authority, and affected local government. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms and conditions for multiple awards are included in the request for proposal, the lead local authority may award contracts to more than one respondent. Should the lead local authority determine in writing that only one respondent is fully qualified, or that one respondent is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that respondent. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(E) Upon approval of the selection by the lead local authority, a contract or contracts not exceeding 50 years in duration may be entered into with the selected respondents on behalf of all participating entities, subject to approval by each such participating entity and by each affected local government. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(5) A dispute over the award of a contract under this article shall be resolved by the filing of a petition in the superior court of the county in which the lead local authority is located within 30 days of the awarding of such contract and shall be determined through the use of a special master appointed by the judge of the superior court of the county in which the lead local authority is located. The decision of the special master with regard to such dispute shall be appealable for a de novo review to the superior court of the county in which the lead local authority is located within 30 days following the decision of the special master. Neither the special master nor the superior court shall be authorized to enjoin or otherwise delay or suspend the execution of the contract and any work to be performed under such contract. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(6) Nothing in this Code section shall require the designated representatives, the lead local authority, or any local governing authority, local authority, or state agency or authority to continue negotiations or discussions arising out of any request for proposal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(7) Every local governing authority and local authority shall be authorized to promulgate reasonable rules or regulations to assist in its evaluation of proposals and to implement the purposes of this article. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6">Summary judgment was properly granted to the deputy as the deputy was not subject to liability for the automobile accident and the plaintiff's claims against the deputy were barred because the term "local government entity" included sheriffs' offices; any local government officer or employee who committed a tort involving the use of a covered motor vehicle while in the performance of the employee's official duties was not subject to lawsuit or liability; and the deputy was employed as a county sheriff's deputy and the deputy was driving a county-owned vehicle en route to the sheriff's office's evidence room where the deputy worked as an evidence custodian when the accident with the plaintiff occurred.
