<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - The Twenty-First Amendment removes spirituous liquors and alcohol from the protection of the commerce clause to the extent necessary to allow states to adopt and enforce appropriate laws and regulations dealing with the subject, and thus to burden interstate commerce to this extent. Even in absence of any protection under the Twenty-First Amendment, the sovereign states in the exercise of their reserve police power may, without offending the commerce clause, adopt and enforce necessary laws and regulations to effectuate their own protection against illegal traffic and trade in liquors. Atkins v. Manning, 206 Ga. 219, 56 S.E.2d 260 (1949) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction to determine constitutionality of rules.</b> - Rules of the commissioner promulgated under authority of subsection (h) of Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-1022 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-2-2), to control distilled spirits and alcohol are not laws of this state within the meaning of Ga. Const. 1976, Art. V, Sec. III, Para. IV (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. V, Sec. III, Para. II), so as to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to determine their constitutionality. Brosnan v. Undercofler, 220 Ga. 239, 138 S.E.2d 314 (1964) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rules within legislative authorization.</b> - Rules relating to transportation of distilled spirits and alcohol, and requiring that shipment thereof from another state through any part of this state to destination in another state must be by common carrier only, accompanied by invoice or bill of lading showing that shipment is made by shipper duly licensed and authorized, and that shipment is made to one licensed and authorized to receive such shipment, and further providing that any violation is misdemeanor, in view of the provisions of law and its expressed purpose to control all traffic or trade in liquor therein defined, come clearly within permissible legislative authorization. Atkins v. Manning, 206 Ga. 219, 56 S.E.2d 260 (1949) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Regulations to be in accord with law.</b> - There can be no rules and regulations made by commissioner, a violation of which would result in seizure, condemnation, and sale of vehicle being used by owner thereof in alleged violation of such rules, where these rules and regulations, made by commissioner, are not in harmony or in accord with the law. State v. Schafer, 82 Ga. App. 753, 62 S.E.2d 446 (1950) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Law permitted the state revenue department to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with the title under which the law fell or other laws, and the regulations challenged by the two associations were not invalid on the ground that the regulations were unauthorized since the regulations governing distribution of malt beverages in Georgia that were challenged were all authorized generally by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-2-2(a).

The commissioner shall notify an applicant, licensee, or permit holder in writing of the denial, suspension, or cancellation by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the last known address of the applicant, licensee, or permit holder appearing in the commissioner's files or by personal service upon the applicant, licensee, or permit holder by an authorized agent of the commissioner.

<p class="p10">(2) In the event that the license of any person is canceled by the commissioner under the authority of this title, hold the bonds of the person for a period of three years against any liabilities accruing as a result of the business of the person whose license is canceled. In no event shall the surrender of any bond release any liability; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(4) Promulgate rules and regulations which he or she deems necessary for the conversion from the metric system of measurement to the equivalent English measurement in United States gallons and subdivisions of gallons and shall compute all tax rates at the equivalent English measurement; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Municipal ordinance which provides for automatic loss of a liquor license</b> upon cessation of business is not inconsistent with this title because it permits cancellation without notice and hearing, allegedly required by paragraph (1) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-2-3, because no hearing is required where revocation of license is expressly required by ordinance. City Council v. Crump, 251 Ga. 594, 308 S.E.2d 180 (1983) (decided prior to 1982 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of revocation procedures.</b> - Liquor license revocation procedures which provide for a hearing, preceded by advance notice setting forth charge forming basis for revocation, are sufficient to comport adequately with due process mandates. Page v. Jackson, 398 F. Supp. 263 (N.D. Ga. 1975) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Due process required for revocation of license.</b> - Liquor license holder has sufficient property interest in holding license to date of its automatic termination that revocation of license must be accompanied by rudimentary due process protections. Liquor licenses may not be revoked during the period of their effectiveness without such protections. Page v. Jackson, 398 F. Supp. 263 (N.D. Ga. 1975) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The primary right to revoke a license lies with the commissioner,</b> and this right may be used only for cause and after hearing. Crummey v. State, 83 Ga. App. 459, 64 S.E.2d 380 (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitation on regulation by authorizing statutes.</b> - Even though the commissioner is given authority to make reasonable rules and regulations for the enforcement and administration of former Code 1933, Ch. 58-10 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-2-3), the commissioner could not, by regulation, make penal and punish therefor as a misdemeanor something which is not made penal under the law itself, but could only enforce regulation by suspension or cancellation of license of offending party or parties. Columbus Wine Co. v. Sheffield, 83 Ga. App. 593, 64 S.E.2d 356 (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial and cancellation of liquor licenses are actions of public official subject to court review.</b> - In the absence of some remedial review prescribed by law, equity is available to review alleged abuses of discretion by administrative licensing authority. Blackmon v. Alexander, 233 Ga. 832, 213 S.E.2d 842 (1975) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex.

Allen v. Giddens, 118 Ga. App. 755, 165 S.E.2d 606 (1968) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Procedure for contesting seizure.</b> - The sole statutory provision for contesting seizure of contraband beer under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103 (see now subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-2-35), is filing of claim pursuant to Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex.

<p class="p4"><b>Procedural irregularities not cause for suppression of evidence.</b> - When executing officers gave to the defendant an inventory of items seized, their failure to deliver a similar inventory to the magistrate issuing the warrant as required by Ga. L. 1966, p. 567 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-5-2), and a return thereof on a warrant as required by Ga. L. 1966, p. 567 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-5-29), and a delivery to the sheriff of items seized and a report to the commissioner as required by Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103 (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-2-35), was not cause for suppression of the evidence. Holloway v. State, 134 Ga. App. 498, 215 S.E.2d 262 (1975) (decided under former Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Liquor licenses may not be revoked during period of their effectiveness without some rudimentary due process protections.</b> - A liquor license holder has a sufficient property interest in holding license to date of its automatic termination that revocation of that license must be accompanied by rudimentary due process protections. Liquor license revocation procedures which provide for a hearing, preceded by advance notice setting forth charge forming basis for revocation, are sufficient to comport adequately with due process mandates.

Comp. R. &amp; Regs. r. 560-2-2-.38 by issuing corporate stock to an employee's wife, the stock agreement was not illegal or immoral; thus, a trial court erred in voiding the stock interest of the employee's wife, and summary judgment in favor of the corporation in the wife's action for an accounting, dissolution, and other relief was reversed.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of sovereign immunity to action between city and county.</b> - In a case involving taxation of alcoholic beverages, the city's claims against the county were not barred by sovereign immunity since the city and county were merely exercising their own respective home rule powers by collecting tax revenues for their own purposes, and neither was acting on behalf of the State of Georgia; thus, there was no sovereignty to be maintained.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, annotations decided under Ga. L. 1935, p. 73 and Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County code requiring liquor permits constitutional.</b> - Section of DeKalb County Code requiring all employees of an establishment holding a license for consumption of beer or wine, except busboys, cooks, and dishwashers, to have permits was not unconstitutional and did not exceed the county's powers of home rule. Kariuki v. DeKalb County, 253 Ga. 713, 324 S.E.2d 450 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Russell v. City of E. Point, 261 Ga. 213, 403 S.E.2d 50 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 971, 112 S. Ct. 448, 116 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Alcohol licensing ordinance constitutional.</b> - County licensing ordinance provided an applicant with adequate notice of the criteria applied in consideration of an application for an alcohol license, and the commission exercised the commission's discretion within the plain, ascertainable standards thereof. Myon Tul Chu v. Augusta-Richmond County, 269 Ga. 822, 504 S.E.2d 693 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">That part of the Jasper, Ga., Alcoholic Beverages Ordinance that authorized license revocation for any legal violation that the City Council determined to have occurred violated due process principles and could not stand; there were no such limits on the council's discretionary revocation authority and no "ascertainable standards" to guide or limit the grounds for the Council's decision. Folsom v. City of Jasper, 279 Ga. 260, 612 S.E.2d 287 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section does not create property interest.</b> - This section does not create the concrete expectation necessary for the creation of a constitutionally protectible property interest because it merely requires the promulgation of standards for the issuance of a malt-beverage license, but does not itself outline standards which, if met, would lead to the issuance of a malt-beverage license. Scoggins v. Moore, 579 F. Supp. 1320 (N.D. Ga.) aff'd, 747 F.2d 1466 (11th Cir. 1984); Top Shelf, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; Aldermen, 840 F. Supp. 903 (S.D. Ga. 1993)see also;. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-2 does not in itself create a protectable property interest but, once the governing authority promulgates an ordinance which outlines the standards for issuance of a malt-beverage license, applicants possess a protectable property interest. McCollum v. City of Powder Springs, 720 F. Supp. 985 (N.D. Ga. 1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of due process in issuance of licenses.</b> - The failure of the county commission to issue standards as to the issuance of licenses for the sale of malt beverages, coupled with the lack of response to an application to sell malt beverages, while at the same time tacitly issuing licenses to some citizens, constituted a denial of due process and of equal protection under the law. Johnson v. Brown, 584 F. Supp. 510 (M.D. Ga. 1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of equal protection in issuance of licenses.</b> - It was a denial of equal protection for the sheriff and county commissioners to refuse to grant a beer and wine license to a qualified applicant while at the same time conspiring to ignore illegal beer sales by other establishments in the county. Parham v. Hix, 608 F. Supp. 546 (M.D. Ga. 1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refusal to issue any licenses not subject to procedural guidelines.</b> - Because state law does not grant an applicant a property interest in the opportunity to acquire a liquor license, a county commissioner's failure to establish standards for the granting of a license does not violate the applicant's due process rights. Further, when the commissioner refuses to grant any licenses whatsoever, Georgia law does not require the commissioner to follow the procedural safeguards outlined in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-2 when the commissioner denies a license request. Cheek v. Gooch, 779 F.2d 1507 (11th Cir. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Express authorization for ordinance.</b> - Subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-2 constitutes an express authorization by general law for Effingham County to exercise by local ordinance the police power of revoking licenses for the sale of beer and wine, so long as the ordinance meets the requirement of Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec. VI, Para. IV(a), that it not conflict with general law. Grovenstein v. Effingham County, 262 Ga. 45, 414 S.E.2d 207 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of county referendum on municipality.</b> - A municipality which has not conducted a local referendum, but is located within a county which has held a referendum, is not empowered by the result of the county referendum to allow sales of liquor by the drink. Price v. City of Snellville, 253 Ga. 166, 317 S.E.2d 834 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County ordinance using voting districts and property lines</b> to determine the number and location of licensed stores was reasonably related to the county's goal of regulating the retail sale of beer and wine and did not violate due process. Bradshaw v. Dayton, 270 Ga. 884, 514 S.E.2d 831 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Decision to revoke a license may precede a hearing.</b> City Council v. Crump, 251 Ga. 594, 308 S.E.2d 180 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of malt beverages is privilege, and denial of license does not deprive accused of anything to which the accused has absolute right.</b> Collier v. State, 54 Ga. App. 346, 187 S.E. 843 (1936); Ebling v. City of Rome, 54 Ga. App. 608, 188 S.E. 727 (1936); Acree v. Ragsdale, 60 Ga. App. 717, 4 S.E.2d 708 (1939); Lamb v. Fedderwitz, 68 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Since no right, but mere privilege, is involved,</b> one denied license is not in position to assert denial of a right guaranteed by state or federal constitutions. Kicklighter v. City of Jesup, 219 Ga. 744, 135 S.E.2d 890 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Due process requirement.</b> - Determination of whether liquor license should be granted is function of aldermanic board (governing authority) acting under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-2), and this determination must accord with constitutional standards of due process and equal protection. Hornsby v. Allen, 326 F.2d 605 (5th Cir. 1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of license when standards met.</b> - If governing authority of city or county decides to permit sale of malt beverages or beer, it shall adopt an ordinance setting forth prescribed standards for issuance of licenses. When an applicant for a license meets these standards, refusal by governing authority to issue license constitutes denial of equal protection, entitling applicant to writ of mandamus. Tipton v. City of Dudley, 242 Ga. 807, 251 S.E.2d 545 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>For right to sell malt beverages, petitioner must obtain license from governing authority of one's county.</b> Tate v. Seymour, 181 Ga. 801, 184 S.E. 598 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This section requires local license as condition precedent to issuance of license by state.</b> Crews v. Undercofler, 371 F.2d 534 (5th Cir. 1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Under Georgia law, obtaining a municipal license is a prerequisite to obtaining a state liquor license.</b> Page v. Jackson, 398 F. Supp. 263 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of authorities in granting license.</b> - This section empowers county authorities to grant licenses, but the power to act is left to the discretion of the local authority, and if the commissioner refuses to grant the license, mandamus will not control the commissioner's discretion; however, where the refusal is arbitrary and contrary to law, mandamus is a remedy. Harbin v. Holcomb, 181 Ga. 800, 184 S.E. 603 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mandamus is an available remedy where refusal to authorize sale of malt beverages is arbitrary and illegal.</b> Tate v. Seymour, 181 Ga. 801, 184 S.E. 598 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No malt beverage business shall be conducted in any incorporated municipality of this state without a license</b> from governing authority of municipality, and governing authority is given discretionary powers as to granting or refusal of licenses. Hudon v. North Atlanta, 108 Ga. App. 370, 133 S.E.2d 58 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to sell malt beverages or beer is subject to determination of governing authorities of city or county;</b> they have the right to prohibit its sale and deny all applicants a license. Tipton v. City of Dudley, 242 Ga. 807, 251 S.E.2d 545 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of license and power of revocation.</b> - A license to sell beer in this state is neither a contract nor a right of property within legal and constitutional meaning of those terms. It is no more than temporary permit to do that which would otherwise be unlawful, and forms part of internal police system of this state. Hence, authority which granted license retains power to revoke it for due cause. Ebling v. City of Rome, 54 Ga. 608, 188 S.E. 727 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County without authority to require county license.</b> - Glynn County has no authority to require county license for sale of alcoholic beverages on Jekyll Island, since island is owned by state and is governed by Jekyll Island State Park Authority. Glynn County v. Davis, 228 Ga. 588, 186 S.E.2d 872 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State statutes preempted city's ordinance.</b> - Conviction and fine against a convenience store operator for violating a city ordinance that prohibited certain retailers of packaged alcoholic beverages from allowing coin operated amusement machines (COAMs) on the same premises was reversed because the state's COAM Laws, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 16-12-35 and 50-27-70 et seq., preempted the city's ordinance at least insofar as the ordinance applied to COAMs as defined by the state statutes.

<p class="p4"><b>This section is not unconstitutional as a violation of the establishment clause.</b> Neither on its face nor in its effect nor by its history does this legislation coercively aid a particular religion.

The General Assembly further finds that owners of grocery stores may be reluctant to locate such stores in areas in which it is not possible to sell packages of wine and malt beverages when such sales are permitted elsewhere in the county or municipality. The General Assembly further finds that allowing a local governing authority of a county or municipality to have local control of the distance requirements for the package sales of wine and malt beverages near college campuses will permit such local governments to determine how to best serve the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - The predecessor to this section was not unconstitutional and void on the grounds that it was too uncertain, vague, and indefinite to be capable of penal enforcement. McCaffrey v. State, 183 Ga. 827, 189 S.E. 825 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - The objective when the legislature provided that liquor stores should not be located within 200 (now 100 for wine or beer) yards of a school ground was that there should be no traffic in liquor within specified distance so that teachers and pupils should not be subjected to evil influences connected with liquor traffic. Certainly the legislature did not intend to include in the prohibition all premises on which school children might happen to congregate. Haley v. Bailey, 199 Ga. 486, 34 S.E.2d 685 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The General Assembly intended to establish an area between schools and businesses which sell beer and wine. A reasonable interpretation of legislative intent necessarily requires that the 100-yard barrier of this section apply to schools rather than school buildings. The restriction of sale of beer near schools has no relationship to the building but to the occupants. Since students may receive instructions and congregate on school premises, it is legislative intent that beer and wine not be sold within 100 yards of instructional premises. Davidson v. Lovett, 242 Ga. 375, 249 S.E.2d 61 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power of local authorities to establish greater distance restrictions.</b> - This section establishes only a minimum distance for retail sale of wine and beer from a school or schoolhouse, and local governing authority can establish, pursuant to its police power authority, a distance restriction that is greater than 300 feet.

L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining whether buyer is minor.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23 does not state that it is the duty of the person furnishing or selling liquor to make a determination as to whether or not the person to whom an alcoholic beverage is sold is a minor. Monteford v. State, 162 Ga. App. 491, 292 S.E.2d 93 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Sutter v. Hutchings, 254 Ga. 194, 327 S.E.2d 716 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Knowledge of minor's degree of intoxication.</b> - Evidence was insufficient to show that any breach of duty by a bowling alley relating to alcohol was the proximate cause of the death of a passenger in a car driven by a minor who had been served beer at the bowling alley, where there was no evidence that any employee had knowledge that the minor was intoxicated or would be driving an automobile. Kalpa v. Perczak, 658 F. Supp. 235 (N.D. Ga. 1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability for subsequent death of under aged drinker.</b> - In a negligence action, a drinking establishment breached its duty, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23(a)(1), to abstain from serving alcohol<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to an under aged drinker who later died from injuries sustained from falling from a jeep.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Giving" defined.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23 (c)'s requirement to "give" appears to be satisfied if the parents constructively "give" the alcoholic beverage, by authorizing a person under 21 to consume alcohol in their home. Krebsbach v. State, 209 Ga. App. 474, 433 S.E.2d 649 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession by minor as delinquent or unruly offense.</b> - Possession of alcohol by a minor may be either a delinquent or an unruly offense, and, since it may be a delinquent act, violating a court-ordered probation imposed for such an offense may likewise be a delinquent act. In re C.P., 217 Ga. App. 505, 458 S.E.2d 166 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County ordinance not preempted.</b> - The effect of the Effingham County ordinance is to prohibit sales to minors under more specific circumstances than does O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23's general prohibition against furnishing alcoholic beverages to minors. In so doing, the Effingham County ordinance only augments and strengthens <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23, and does not conflict with that section in any manner. Accordingly, the Effingham County ordinance is not preempted by <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23, and hence is not invalid pursuant to Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec. VI, Para. IV(a). Grovenstein v.

<p class="p4"><b>City ordinance was unconstitutional as conflicting with statute.</b> - Trial court erred by rejecting entertainers' challenge under the uniformity clause, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec.VI, Para. IV(a), to a city's ordinance prohibiting persons aged 18 to 21 from entering adult entertainment establishments where alcohol was served because the ordinance conflicted with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 3-3-23 and 3-3-24(a), allowing persons over 18 to work in such establishments. Willis v. City of Atlanta, 285 Ga. 775, 684 S.E.2d 271 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Administration of alco-sensor test not improper.</b> - Defendant's claim that the administration of an alco-sensor test was improper because a positive alco-sensor of a minor established guilt of the crime of minor in possession of alcohol by consumption under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23 was incorrect; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-3-23(a) explicitly provided that underage alcohol consumption was not a crime if the consumption was otherwise authorized by law.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Not criminal act to violate Department of Revenue regulation.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 3-3-9 and 3-3-27(c)(2) provide that it is a misdemeanor to violate a prohibition or provision of the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, but these provisions do not make it a criminal act to violate a Georgia Department of Revenue regulation; although the parties intended to circumvent Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. r. 560-2-2-.38 by issuing corporate stock to an employee's wife, the stock agreement was not illegal or immoral; thus, a trial court erred in voiding the stock interest of the employee's wife, and summary judgment in favor of the corporation in the wife's action for an accounting, dissolution, and other relief was reversed. Edwards v. Grapefields, Inc., 267 Ga. App. 399, 599 S.E.2d 489 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Irrelevant allegation in indictment mere surplusage.</b> - Where indictment sufficiently charged manufacture of liquor in dry county, allegation that this was done without having first obtained a manufacturer's license as required by law would be treated as mere surplusage. Tanner v. State, 90 Ga. App. 789, 84 S.E.2d 600 (1954) (decided under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof.</b> - It need only be proven that the defendant is guilty of manufacturing one particular brand of liquor, but the state must prove that beyond a reasonable doubt. Hobbs v. State, 98 Ga. App. 816, 107 S.E.2d 253 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presence at still sufficient to support conviction for manufacturing.</b> - One who is present at a distillery when liquor is being manufactured and personally assists in any way in the manufacture is guilty of manufacturing liquor, and it is immaterial whether or not one owns the distillery, and whether or not one is hired to work there. Tanner v. State, 90 Ga. App. 789, 84 S.E.2d 600 (1954) (decided under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Presence of person at distillery where intoxicating liquor is being made, and the person's flight on seeing an officer approaching, may, when not satisfactorily explained, authorize the jury to find the person guilty of making such liquor. Smith v. State, 46 Ga. App. 351, 167 S.E. 714 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presence at still sufficient to support conviction for possession.</b> - Since the presence of the defendant at a place where a still was in operation and the defendant's flight from it would have been sufficient to have convicted the defendant of manufacturing whiskey and since the same rule as to sufficiency must apply where one is charged with possession of whiskey stored at such a distillery, the evidence was sufficient to authorize the jury to find the defendant guilty. Johnson v. State, 79 Ga. App. 210, 53 S.E.2d 498 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere presence at still not unlawful.</b> - While it is not unlawful for one to be present at a liquor still while it is in operation, where the jury finds that the defendant was not only at the still, but assisted in its operation in some manner, the defendant's conviction would be authorized. Brown v. State, 87 Ga. App. 244, 73 S.E.2d 502 (1952) (decided under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One's presence at a still is not alone sufficient to sustain a conviction</b> of manufacturing intoxicating liquor. In addition there must be shown some act or acts essential to illegal manufacture of the liquor. Harris v. State, 119 Ga. App. 684, 168 S.E.2d 337 (1969) (decided under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to support conviction for making whiskey.</b> - Testimony of two witnesses for the state that the defendant admitted to them that the defendant had been helping to make whiskey at the time and place in question, together with undisputed evidence that the defendant was present at the time of the raid at a still then in operation and where whiskey was being made, was sufficient to support the conviction for manufacturing whiskey. Lastinger v. State, 84 Ga. App. 760, 67 S.E.2d 411 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While there was no evidence that whiskey had been distilled, since raid apparently occurred at a time when operation was just beginning and whiskey had not yet had time to run off, evidence was nevertheless sufficient to support verdict of illegal manufacture of alcohol. Bryant v. State, 88 Ga. App. 208, 76 S.E.2d 446 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence that two men, one of whom was the defendant, were found at a still pumping up the tank, that they ran when the officers approached and the defendant was apprehended, and that the still was in operation at the time and over 20 gallons of liquor had already been run is sufficient to sustain a conviction of manufacturing intoxicating liquor. Peebles v. State, 96 Ga. App. 836, 101 S.E.2d 726 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of making beer sufficient to support conviction.</b> - The act of making intoxicating beer, through fermentation of syrup, cornmeal, and water mixed for that purpose, is of itself an offense as complete and distinct as the further act of distilling from such beer a quantity of alcohol, whiskey, or rum, and failure of evidence to show distillation of any quantity of whiskey does not, therefore, leave conviction of accused without any evidence to show that the accused was guilty of making such beer. Bryant v. State, 88 Ga. App. 208, 76 S.E.2d 446 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Indictment broader than actual offense.</b> - Where evidence was sufficient to authorize the jury to find that the defendant was manufacturing alcoholic beer, an offense under this section, indictment for unlawfully manufacturing alcoholic liquors, spirituous liquors, whiskey, and rum was broad enough in its terms to include that offense, and the verdict finding the defendant guilty and recommending that the defendant be punished as for a misdemeanor was supported by evidence. Cook v. State, 88 Ga. App. 330, 76 S.E.2d 629 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase of vast quantity of sugar admissible in evidence.</b> - The purchase by the defendant a short time prior to the defendant's apprehension of almost 25,000 pounds of sugar in less than two months, being a quantity vastly in excess of the requirements of an average person, but a quantity which suited capacity of a still, was a circumstance, together with others, tending to identify the defendant with illegal manufacture of alcohol and was for that reason admissible in evidence. Bryant v. State, 88 Ga. App. 208, 76 S.E.2d 446 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of county's wet or dry status unnecessary.</b> - Conviction under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206 was not without evidence to support it merely because there was no probative evidence that the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages had not been legalized in the county of the still's situs under former Code 1933, Ch. 58-10 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-4-1 et seq.). Peebles v. State, 96 Ga. App. 836, 101 S.E.2d 726 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury entitled to disbelieve defendant's contention.</b> - Where the defendant admitted that the defendant manufactured the beer which the sheriff found within curtilage of the defendant's dwelling house and sought to excuse the defendant on the ground that the defendant made it for hog feed, it was within the province of the jury to disbelieve this contention of the defendant. Jackson v. State, 78 Ga. App. 36, 50 S.E.2d 165 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The reasonableness or unreasonableness of an explanation given by the defendant for the defendant's presence at a still was for the jury. Brown v. State, 87 Ga. App. 244, 73 S.E.2d 502 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-206).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Elements of offense.</b> - In order to convict a person of unlawful possession of liquor, it must be shown that the accused knowingly had, possessed, or controlled intoxicating liquor, and the accused must have done something the accused ought not to have done or omitted to do something the accused ought to have done with reference to the whiskey, and while it is not necessary in order to constitute offense of unlawful possession that the accused should have legal control or that it should have been the accused's property, it is essential that the accused should have power to control it, and if whiskey was placed in the accused's place of business and the accused knew it, the accused acquiesces in the possession and is criminally liable therefore. Kelly v. State, 91 Ga. App. 421, 85 S.E.2d 794 (1955) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To violate this section, one must have in one's possession whiskey on which the tax has not been paid. Pierce v. State, 200 Ga. 384, 37 S.E.2d 201, answer conformed to, 73 Ga. App. 627, 37 S.E.2d 431 (1946) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is an offense for one to possess whiskey in a container which does not have affixed thereon the necessary tax stamp. Pierce v. State, 73 Ga. App. 627, 37 S.E.2d 431 (1946) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No offense charged where indictment failed to allege whiskey bore no tax stamps.</b> - Where a person is indicted merely for possession of whiskey at place of business for purpose of sale in wet county, the indictment charges no offense, unless it further charges that the whiskey possessed did not bear required stamps. Womack v. State, 60 Ga. App. 761, 5 S.E.2d 96 (1939) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof on state.</b> - Where the accusation charges the defendant with the offense of possessing non-tax-paid whiskey in dry county, which is a specific crime, the burden is on the state to show that the whiskey found in possession of the defendant is not tax-paid. Ivey v. State, 84 Ga. App. 72, 65 S.E.2d 282 (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Upon trial of one charged with possession of non-tax-paid whiskey, the burden is upon the state to establish that the whiskey found in the possession of the defendant is not tax-paid. Wilson v. State, 93 Ga. App. 43, 90 S.E.2d 605 (1955) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of prior accusation and guilty plea to similar offense.</b> - Mere introduction of accusation with pleas of guilty thereon, embracing same crime for which defendant is on trial, without proof of details as to manner in which previous acts were committed, does not constitute similarity of transactions so connected as to reveal knowledge, plan, or system, and therefore the court erred in admitting, over objections, prior accusation and plea of guilty of defendant, charged with possession of non-tax-paid whiskey, to a previous charge of same offense. Chambers v. State, 76 Ga. App. 269, 45 S.E.2d 724 (1947) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of evidence as to smell of liquid.</b> - Where, upon approach of arresting officers, an attempt is made to dispose of liquid identified by witnesses by sense of smell as being whiskey or whiskey poured into water, this is a circumstance which may be considered in prosecution for possession of non-tax-paid whiskey. Corbin v. State, 84 Ga. App. 763, 67 S.E.2d 478 (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of defendant's possession a rebuttable presumption.</b> - Although proof that illegal liquor was found in the home of the accused, the accused being the head of the household, raises a rebuttable presumption of the accused's possession thereof, proof of which is sufficient to make out a prima facie case, where the premises are occupied by the defendant with others not members of the accused's immediate family, the presumption does not obtain. Brown v. State, 99 Ga. App. 713, 109 S.E.2d 813 (1959) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence that non-tax-paid whiskey was found on premises in possession and control of defendant raises a rebuttable presumption that possession thereof is that of defendant. West v. State, 103 Ga. App. 71, 118 S.E.2d 491 (1961) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient for conviction for possession.</b> - Where officers, while in search of a whiskey still which had been reported to them, heard nearby noises of bottles being shoved around and clinking together, and where they immediately investigated and found the defendant and the defendant's brother together examining a strainer, and further found over 70 pints of bottled whiskey not having required state revenue stamps, such evidence was sufficient to show control and possession in the defendant and the defendant's brother and to support a verdict of guilty against the defendant. Ridley v. State, 66 Ga. App. 658, 19 S.E.2d 51 (1942) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Jury was authorized to conclude from evidence that defendant was a confederate with the defendant's brother and another individual in illegal possession of non-tax-paid liquor, that a conspiracy existed between the three to violate the liquor law, and that while another individual was driving and owned the car, the 45 gallons of whiskey in the back of the car were in the joint and exclusive possession of the three. Lee v. State, 72 Ga. App. 643, 34 S.E.2d 645 (1945) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where it appears that defendant is in sole control of premises and public does not have access thereto, where the only tracks from cache of liquor lead to defendant's home and fresh tracks show recent travel from house to liquor, and where there are no other residents in vicinity and cache is not near any road, trail, alley, or path used by others than the defendant and the defendant's household, the evidence, though circumstantial, is sufficient to negate every other reasonable hypothesis save that of guilt of accused. Corbin v. State, 84 Ga. App. 763, 67 S.E.2d 478 (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Testimony of state's witness that the witness found non-tax-paid whiskey in a half-gallon jar on top of some clothes in closet of room occupied by defendant, together with glass of whiskey in kitchen in cabinet that had secret panel behind it was sufficient, coupled with defendant's admission that it was "all her house," to sustain conviction of possessing illegal liquor, although there were other people in house at time arrest was made. Grantley v. State, 90 Ga. App. 735, 84 S.E.2d 98 (1954) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A conviction may be had upon a free and voluntary confession corroborated only by proof of the corpus delicti, and where, upon the trial of one charged with possession of non-tax-paid whiskey, it appears from the evidence that police officers found some five and one-half pints of non-tax-paid liquor in defendant's home, and that defendant freely and voluntarily confessed that the non-tax-paid liquor belonged to the defendant, the jury is authorized to find the defendant guilty as charged. Poythress v. State, 95 Ga. App. 124, 97 S.E.2d 165 (1957) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where five and one-half gallons of moonshine were found in back seat of long-unused automobile in back yard of petitioner's residence, which yard was fenced with a fence of sufficient construction and security to keep contained therein a dog, and a well-beaten path led from petitioner's back door to automobile, and there was a quantity of used whiskey bottles under back of petitioner's house, evidence was sufficient to authorize conviction for possessing non-tax-paid whiskey. West v. State, 103 Ga. App. 71, 118 S.E.2d 491 (1961) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence insufficient for conviction for possession.</b> - The evidence, being wholly circumstantial, was insufficient to sustain conviction for offense of possessing non-tax-paid whiskey. Weehunt v. State, 80 Ga. App. 368, 56 S.E.2d 148 (1949) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Whiskey found by a trail or ditch or in bushes at some distance from the house, and especially when on property not under control of the defendant, has been held insufficient as the foundation of a conviction. Freeman v. State, 84 Ga. App. 757, 67 S.E.2d 314 (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the conviction for possessing non-tax-paid whiskey depends entirely upon the circumstance of liquor being found on premises belonging to or under control of the defendant, and where such liquor is located by a public path, in a public part of building, in an unenclosed field by a travelled road or alley, or other circumstances appear not negating the possibility that a person other than the defendant might have had the opportunity to conceal the liquor in place where it was found, a conviction is unauthorized. Corbin v. State, 84 Ga. App. 763, 67 S.E.2d 478 (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>This section authorizes the licensing by state of distilling and manufacturing only in those counties which have voted in favor</b> of taxing and controlling alcoholic liquors. A license cannot, therefore, be lawfully issued and granted by the state to a person to manufacture, sell, or distribute alcohol or distilled spirits in a dry county. It is, therefore, no penal offense, separate from the unlawful manufacture of alcoholic liquor, for a person to operate a whiskey still and manufacture such alcoholic liquor or alcohol without obtaining a license to do so from the state. Shuman v. State, 82 Ga. App. 130, 60 S.E.2d 521 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>A person cannot be legally licensed by state to manufacture alcoholic liquors in dry county;</b> hence, one found operating illicit liquor still in dry county cannot be convicted of operating a distillery without a license in violation of this section. Odum v. State, 82 Ga. App. 134, 60 S.E.2d 522 (1950); Tanner v. State, 90 Ga. App. 789, 84 S.E.2d 600 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Where commodity may be legally sold under a license, indictment alleging unlawful sale of such commodity must negate fact that accused had a license,</b> under terms of which sale would have been legal. Thus, an indictment for unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors which fails to allege that either accused or purchasers did not have a distillers' license is insufficient. Capitol Distrib. Co. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election a nullity absent proper petition.</b> - A cursory reading of both Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103, <span class="s1">§§</span> 4 and 9 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 3-4-41 and 3-4-47) will disclose that before the ordinary (election superintendent) is authorized to call an election under either section a petition signed by 35 percent or more of the qualified voters of the county must be presented. It follows that if either election be called without such petition having first been presented, such election is a nullity. Glass v. State, 75 Ga. App. 602, 44 S.E.2d 143 (1947), overruled on other grounds, Domin v. State, 85 Ga. App. 676, 70 S.E.2d 39 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consolidated individual petitions sufficient.</b> - Where there were several circulated petitions seeking to call a special election to nullify previously voted authority for sale of alcoholic beverages and liquors within county, but majority of names were signed to individual petitions asking in legal terms that election be called, each petition signed by one individual registered voter, and all petitions were pasted in one consolidated petition and presented to the ordinary (election superintendent), such consolidated petition was held to be sufficient in form to meet requirements of this section, there being evidence to show there was a sufficient number of signatures to bring the total to the required 35 percent. McCluney v. Stembridge, 206 Ga. 321, 57 S.E.2d 203 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disqualification of election superintendent for signing petition.</b> - The fact that the ordinary (election superintendent) was one of those who signed, as an individual, a petition requesting the call of a special election for purpose of submitting to qualified voters of county the question of taxing, legalizing, and controlling alcoholic beverages and liquors, did not show that the ordinary was disqualified because the ordinary was pecuniarily interested in the matter before the ordinary, or that the ordinary was otherwise disqualified from calling and holding a special election. McCluney v. Stembridge, 206 Ga. 321, 57 S.E.2d 203 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Verification of petitions prior to call for election.</b> - The ordinary (election superintendent) is required to verify that petitions were signed by at least 35 percent of registered voters before the ordinary can issue a valid election call, and this prerequisite is mandatory. The only requirement imposed by this section with respect to the petition is that it be "signed by at least 35 percent of the registered voters qualified to vote at the general election immediately preceding the presentation of the petition." The calling of the election by the ordinary as authorized by this section determines at least prima facie that the petitioners are of the class and are of a sufficient number as required by this section for the purpose of calling an election. Committee for New Cobb County Revenue v. Brown, 228 Ga. 364, 185 S.E.2d 534 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Waiving statutory time period for holding election.</b> - While this section provides that the ordinary (election superintendent) "shall call a special election to be held within 30 days from the filing of such petition," this is not an absolute requirement that election must be held within that period of time. Where election is not required by statute to be held on a date certain, and where election is prevented by court order, it is permissible to reschedule election after expiration of court's injunction even though the 30-day period has elapsed. If there is a statutory time period within which election must be held and, following litigation, there is no longer time to hold election within statutory period, an election may be held after statutory period has expired. Committee for New Cobb County Revenue v. Brown, 228 Ga. 364, 185 S.E.2d 534 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compliance of call for election with section.</b> - Where call for election as issued by the ordinary (election superintendent) on the question of legalizing alcoholic beverages gave notice that election would be held in all voting precincts of county, and that voting polls would be open in all voting precincts of county between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M., and that those qualified to vote at the election would be determined in all respects in accordance with the laws governing elections for members of General Assembly, the call was in substantial accord with this section and was sufficient. McCluney v. Stembridge, 206 Ga. 321, 57 S.E.2d 203 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice requirement.</b> - If election is advertised once a week for two consecutive weeks, this will not satisfy this section if election is held on Saturday of last week during which notice is published. Under this section the two weekly publications of notice must precede the week in which election is held. Whittle v. Whitley, 202 Ga. 633, 44 S.E.2d 241 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Resubmission of question after election resulting in tie vote.</b> - Where a liquor election was held under this section, fact that election resulted in tie vote did not make it the duty of the ordinary (election superintendent) to resubmit question to voters. Broadhurst v. Hawkins, 188 Ga. 316, 3 S.E.2d 905 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judicial notice of dry or wet status of county.</b> - Accusations and indictments charging liquor violations need not allege that counties in which they are preferred have held an election to comply with the law, this being a matter of which the courts will take judicial notice.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - This section, insofar as it authorizes holding election for purpose of nullifying previous election legalizing alcoholic beverages in county, is not unconstitutional as violative of due process on ground that no provision is made for right to contest election held thereunder or on ground that provision is so indefinite that any proceeding amounts to a taking of property of qualified distributors of alcoholic beverages without due process of law. Sanders v. Mason, 197 Ga. 522, 29 S.E.2d 780 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No standing to attack constitutionality.</b> - Constitutional attack on this section by corporations who were selling intoxicants in dry county under allegedly valid licenses was dismissed since corporations had no property rights to have such license and therefore were without standing to attack this section. DeKalb County v. Florentine Corp., 228 Ga. 228, 185 S.E.2d 85 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - The legislature intended in enacting this section only to give those counties which had voted favorably for control the same means of abolishing or repealing the control of manufacture, sale, and distribution of alcoholic beverages and liquors; the section does not render a previous election void ab initio, so as to be retrospective. Thacker v. Morris, 196 Ga. 167, 26 S.E.2d 329 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 4 and Ga.

Griner, 205 Ga. 830, 55 S.E.2d 536 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election a nullity absent proper petition.</b> - A cursory reading of both Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103, <span class="s1">§</span> 4<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Ga. L. 1941, p. 199, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 3-4-41 and 3-4-46) would disclose that before the ordinary (election superintendent) was authorized to call an election under either section a petition signed by 35 percent or more of the qualified voters of the county must be presented. It follows that if either election be called without such petition having first been presented, such election is a nullity. Glass v. State, 75 Ga. App. 602, 44 S.E.2d 143 (1947), overruled on other grounds, Domin v. State, 85 Ga. App. 676, 70 S.E.2d 39 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Among the prerequisites to the call of an election for nullifying a previous election are:</b> (1) no election can be called within two years after the date of the declaration of the result of a previous election; (2) no election shall be called except upon the petition of at least 35 percent of the registered qualified voters, qualified to vote in the general election immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; and (3) the election shall be held within 30 days from the filing of the petition, and notice of the election shall be published in the official gazette of the county once a week for two weeks preceding the election. Barrentine v. Griner, 205 Ga. 830, 55 S.E.2d 536 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The requirement as to notice of special election was mandatory, and failure to comply therewith vitiated election;</b> in these circumstances, petition by licensed liquor dealers, seeking to enjoin the ordinary (election superintendent) from putting the result of such election into effect, set forth a cause of action. The prerequisite as to proper petition by 35 percent of qualified registered voters is also mandatory, and it follows that failure to comply with the mandatory prerequisite vitiates election. Barrentine v. Griner, 205 Ga. 830, 55 S.E.2d 536 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effects of violations of mandatory and directory provisions on validity of election.</b> - There is a marked distinction between mandatory provisions of law in regard to calling of election and those which are merely directory to officials in holding them. A substantial violation of mandatory provisions affects validity of election, while a failure of strict compliance with directory provisions of law, or mere irregularities on part of election officers, will not generally do so; and the latter are usually the subject matter of contests. Barrentine v. Griner, 205 Ga. 830, 55 S.E.2d 536 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When petition has been acted upon and election ordered by designated authorities, presumption is that petition was in due and legal form</b> and that it was signed by requisite percentage of qualified voters, and in absence of any evidence to the contrary, that presumption is sufficient. Sanders v. Mason, 197 Ga. 522, 29 S.E.2d 780 (1944); Williams v. Gould, 203 Ga. 96, 45 S.E.2d 218 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of equity is not authorized to surmise or assume invalidity of signatures regularly presented to the ordinary (election superintendent),</b> or to enjoin such officer from calling an election in the face of the ordinary's prima facie determination as to the sufficiency of the consolidated petition presented. Williams v. Gould, 203 Ga. 96, 45 S.E.2d 218 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rebuttable presumption that election superintendent performed statutory duties.</b> - The action of the ordinary (election superintendent), as result of petition having been filed with the ordinary, in calling election and declaring results thereof, determines prima facie that requirements of this section providing for calling of such election have been complied with in due and legal form. This is nothing more nor less than a rebuttable presumption that the ordinary has properly performed the required duties. Sanders v. Mason, 197 Ga. 522, 29 S.E.2d 780 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judicial notice of dry or wet status of county.</b> - Accusations and indictments charging liquor violations need not allege that counties in which they are preferred have held an election to comply with the law, this being a matter of which the courts will take judicial notice. Domin v. State, 85 Ga. App. 676, 70 S.E.2d 39 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of license and power of revocation.</b> - A license to sell beer in this state is neither a contract nor a right of property within legal and constitutional meaning of those terms. It is no more than a temporary permit to do that which would otherwise be unlawful, and forms part of internal police system of this state. Hence, authority which granted license retains power to revoke it for due cause. Ebling v. City of Rome, 54 Ga. 608, 188 S.E. 727 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Att'y Gen. p. 260. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">General Assembly, in legalizing sale of malt beverages, intended for municipalities to be part of machinery for proper control and supervision of sale of malt beverages within municipalities, and did not intend to place municipalities in business of selling beer with public funds in competition with private business. 1948-49 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 260.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No authority for municipalities to sell malt beverages.</b> - Unless express power has been generally conferred upon municipalities by General Assembly to engage in selling of malt beverages, as now legalized and codified, there is no authority of law for municipality to engage in such business. 1948-49 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Mandamus as remedy for arbitrary refusal.</b> - Mandamus is an available remedy where refusal to authorize sale of malt beverages is arbitrary and illegal. Tate v. Seymour, 181 Ga. 801, 184 S.E. 598 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This section empowers county authorities to grant licenses, but the power to act is left to discretion of local authority, and if commissioner refuses to grant license, mandamus will not control the commissioner's discretion; however, when the refusal is arbitrary and contrary to law, mandamus is a remedy.

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of license when standards met.</b> - If governing authority of city or county decides to permit sale of malt beverages or beer, it shall adopt an ordinance setting forth the prescribed standards for issuance of licenses. When an applicant for a license meets these standards, refusal by governing authority to issue the license constitutes denial of equal protection, entitling applicant to writ of mandamus. Tipton v.

<p class="p4"><b>No denial of equal protection absent ordinance and proof showing plaintiff met standards.</b> - Absent indication that the city has adopted some ordinance setting forth prescribed standards for the issuance of a license to sell beer or wine and that the plaintiff has met such standards, the refusal by the city to issue the license does not constitute a denial of equal protection, entitling the applicant to a writ of mandamus.

<p class="p4"><b>Sales by "implied consent" illegal.</b> - The privilege of sales of beer and wine is conditional upon the city's exercise of its discretion in performing an affirmative act in either granting or refusing a permit or license; hence, sales by "implied consent" are not authorized or legal, and there is no violation of equal protection. Grandpa's Store, Inc. v. City of Norcross, 247 Ga. 350, 275 S.E.2d 59 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff has no right to permit where other businesses are selling beer illegally.</b> - The fact that one or more businesses are selling beer and/or wine in violation of the statutes, even if proved, does not give the plaintiff any right to have a permit issued to it. The city has the right to prohibit the sale of beer and/or wine and deny all applicants a license. Grandpa's Store, Inc. v.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of sovereign immunity to action between city and county.</b> - In a suit by a city against a county, seeking a portion of tax revenue raised by the county from alcoholic beverage sales, there was a threshold question of whether sovereign immunity applied in suits between political subdivisions of the same sovereign (such as the city and the county), which the trial court had not addressed; therefore, remand was required.

<p class="p4">In a case involving taxation of alcoholic beverages, the city's claims against the county were not barred by sovereign immunity since the city and county were merely exercising their own respective home rule powers by collecting tax revenues for their own purposes, and neither was acting on behalf of the State of Georgia; thus, there was no sovereignty to be maintained.

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial notice of status of county as wet or dry.</b> - In prosecution for selling tax-paid whiskey it is entirely unnecessary to allege or prove that county is not exempted from the provisions of law prohibiting sale of whiskey, this being a matter which shall be judicially recognized without introduction of proof. Dye v. State, 118 Ga. App. 570, 165 S.E.2d 183 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inducement to sell or possess prohibited liquor no defense.</b> - If, at time in question and at time of solicitation for sale of whiskey, defendant was engaged in business of selling and possessing intoxicating liquor, it would be no defense that the defendant was merely induced by solicitation and misrepresentation to sell or possess such prohibited liquor. Sutton v. State, 59 Ga. App. 198, 200 S.E. 225 (1938), overruled on other grounds, Keaton v. State, 253 Ga. 70, 316 S.E.2d 452 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant need not be owner to be convicted for illegal sale.</b> - All engaged in commission of misdemeanor are principals, and when a defendant works for another at the defendant's place of business, where the defendant's duties are to be performed, the defendant may be guilty of selling whiskey in dry county, even though the defendant is not owner of whiskey, but merely employee and agent of owner. Faucette v. State, 71 Ga. App. 331, 30 S.E.2d 808 (1944) (decided under former Code 1993 <span class="s1">§</span> 58-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No offense charged when indictment failed to allege whiskey bore no tax stamps.</b> - When a person is indicted merely for possession of whiskey at place of business for purpose of sale in wet county, indictment charges no offense unless it further charges that whiskey possessed did not bear required stamps. Womack v. State, 60 Ga. App. 761, 5 S.E.2d 96 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burdens of proof.</b> - On an accusation or indictment couched in language of this section, defendant has burden of proving that liquor possessed is properly stamped and within legal limit. Requirement of purchase from authorized liquor retailer and requirement that liquor be held for use and not for sale are matters about which state has burden of proof. Jenkins v. State, 93 Ga. App. 360, 92 S.E.2d 43 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence insufficient to raise defense of entrapment.</b> - Evidence that witness purchased whiskey with money furnished by officer, telling defendant that the witness had just gotten over a drunk and was feeling bad and begging defendant to sell the witness whiskey was not sufficient to raise defense of entrapment. Sutton v. State, 59 Ga. App. 198, 200 S.E. 225 (1938), overruled on other grounds, Keaton v. State, 253 Ga. 70, 316 S.E.2d 452 (1984) (decided under former Code 1993 <span class="s1">§</span> 58-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of possession alone insufficient to support conviction of sale.</b> - When one is being tried for illegal sale of whiskey, evidence that one was in possession of whiskey at or near time of alleged sale is admissible as a circumstance that one kept whiskey for sale or as corroboration of evidence that a sale had taken place, but such evidence, considered alone, will not support conviction of sale, and a charge to jury which leaves them under impression that it is sufficient, in and of itself, is clearly error. Springer v. State, 60 Ga. App. 641, 4 S.E.2d 679 (1939) (decided under former Code 1993 <span class="s1">§</span> 58-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient proof for conviction of owner's employee for illegal sale.</b> - Proof either that defendant directly or personally committed criminal offense (selling whiskey in dry county), or that the defendant aided or abetted criminal transaction of the defendant's employer at the employer's place of business, would authorize the defendant's conviction of offense of selling whiskey. Faucette v. State, 71 Ga. App. 331, 30 S.E.2d 808 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to convict for illegal possession.</b> - Statement of defendant that the defendant thought the defendant would be notified in the event of a raid, in connection with the defendant's other remarks and actions during course of search of club house, was sufficient to authorize jury to infer that the defendant was aiding and assisting in commission of misdemeanors of illegal possession of liquor and slot machines.

<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - It was the purpose and intent of the General Assembly to legalize the possession, in a dry county, of one quart (now one standard case of 1.75 liter, or 750 milliliter size containers, but not more than eight individual containers of distilled spirits of a size of 200 milliliters or four individual containers of distilled spirits of a size of 500 milliliters) of whiskey legally purchased for use and consumption, when properly stamped, and no more. Pierce v. State, 73 Ga. App. 627, 37 S.E.2d 431 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This section is intended to provide a method whereby a person in a dry county may legally possess a quart or less (now more) of tax-paid whiskey bearing revenue stamps so indicating which were originally purchased by the person or the person's donor from a lawful and authorized retailer in a wet county, provided such possession was for use and not for sale. This intention also is that such person may possess such whiskey in this quantity and under these circumstances and conditions without being in constant jeopardy of harassment and arrest. Jenkins v. State, 93 Ga. App. 360, 92 S.E.2d 43 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

As to the requirement of purchase from authorized liquor retailer and the requirement that the liquor be held for use and not for sale, these were matters about which the state had the burden of proof. Jenkins v. State, 93 Ga. App. 360, 92 S.E.2d 43 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Presumptions.</b> - All presumptions being in favor of innocence, possession of whiskey in quantity within limit described by this section is prima facie presumed to be lawful. Jenkins v. State, 93 Ga. App. 360, 92 S.E.2d 43 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Possession of non-tax-paid whiskey.</b> - Nothing in Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103 (see now O.C.G.A. Ch. 4, T. 3), purports to legalize possession of non-tax-paid whiskey. Its possession, in any quantity in any county of the state, is unlawful under existing law of the state. Pierce v. State, 200 Ga. 384, 37 S.E.2d 201, answer conformed to, 73 Ga. App. 627, 37 S.E.2d 431 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Quantity of contraband possessed immaterial.</b> - The possession of any quantity of contraband whiskey in a dry county subjects the accused to a violation and it is immaterial what quantity of contraband whiskey the accused possessed. Pierce v. State, 73 Ga. App. 627, 37 S.E.2d 431 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933 <span class="s1">§</span> 58-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Possession of contraband whiskey in a dry county constitutes two offenses,</b> one under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex.

<p class="p4">It was not error to admit into evidence several bottles of wine, over objection that there was no evidence of sale of wine but evidence only of possession, because possession of wine in quantities found may have been a circumstance to illustrate the contention that the place was a public nuisance, especially since other evidence disclosed that no license had been issued by the governing authorities for the sale of wine. Elder v. Stark, 200 Ga. 452, 37 S.E.2d 598 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of testimony regarding finding liquor in course of raids.</b> - Testimony of witness as to finding 10 pints and two four-fifths of a quart of whiskey on a raid about four months before filing of instant action, and testimony of another witness as to finding 11 fifths of gin and one pint of whiskey at place in question on a raid about nine months before such action, were admissible where it was shown otherwise that building contained secret panels, traps, and like devices of concealment, and there was additional evidence, circumstantial and direct, of continuity of operation and intention to operate place in violation of law after the previous raids and confiscations. Elder v. Stark, 200 Ga. 452, 37 S.E.2d 598 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence, including whiskey found in building, sufficient to support abatement.</b> - When, upon interlocutory hearing on petition to padlock building as common nuisance, evidence showed that 13 pints of whiskey were found in building and other evidence was sufficient to authorize trial judge to find that whiskey was sold in presence, and with consent, of party operating business therein, the interlocutory judgment enjoining operation of any business therein and directing sheriff to padlock building until further order of court was authorized. Edgeworth v. Wyatt, 202 Ga. 708, 44 S.E.2d 542 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guilty pleas entered before instant action material evidence.</b> - Pleas of guilty to two charges of selling wine without license in county, entered about six months before action under this section was instituted, were material circumstances for consideration with the other evidence, although the evidence as to these pleas, without more, would not have authorized a finding that defendant's place of business was common nuisance within meaning of this section, at time action was filed. Sprayberry v. Wyatt, 203 Ga. 27, 45 S.E.2d 625 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to support finding of continuing violations.</b> - While single transaction might not be sufficient to authorize abatement of place of business as common nuisance, in that law contemplates some continuity of violation, and evidence did not show directly any act of possession or sale later than about a month before action was filed, yet, in view of evidence as to pleas of guilty to selling without a license entered about six months before and evidence as to subsequent sales and possession, the judge was authorized to find that defendant was continuing in such violations of law and that the defendant's place of business was common nuisance within statute at time action was instituted. Sprayberry v. Wyatt, 203 Ga. 27, 45 S.E.2d 625 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to support finding of common nuisance.</b> - Where evidence showed an illegal sale of whiskey, coupled with other circumstances, such as evidence showing that when sale was made the defendant named several brands of whiskey from which buyer might choose, and proof of application for and issuance of retail liquor license, which was in effect at time of sale and bringing of action, the trial judge was amply authorized to find that defendant's place of business was common nuisance at time action was instituted. Norris v. State ex rel. Willingham, 204 Ga. 441, 50 S.E.2d 22 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One illegal sale, together with other evidence, sufficient to abate place as nuisance.</b> - Evidence as to one illegal sale, coupled with corroborative circumstances indicating continuity of such conduct, is sufficient to authorize abatement of place of business as common nuisance. Norris v. State ex rel. Willingham, 204 Ga. 441, 50 S.E.2d 22 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Entire building not abatable as nuisance.</b> - Under proper interpretation of this section, entire building could not be abated as nuisance without some evidence tending to show that different portions of building were operated as a unit and that in such operation intoxicating liquors were kept and sold in violation of law. Norris v. State ex rel. Willingham, 204 Ga. 441, 50 S.E.2d 22 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Abuse of discretion in padlocking defendant's dwelling.</b> - Although evidence authorized abatement of nuisance, an order of the trial court was too broad in that it required padlocking of entire premises of defendant, notwithstanding all the evidence as to illegal sales of whiskey related solely to defendant's place of business, there being no evidence of sale or location of whiskey in the defendant's dwelling; and trial court, therefore, abused its discretion in passing so much of order as would result in padlocking of defendant's dwelling and dispossession of the defendant's family.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to malt beverages.</b> - It is not a violation merely to transport, possess, or store fermented beverages made from malt, and a vehicle being used for such purpose cannot legally be seized and condemned as contraband (but see Ga. L. 1937, p. 148 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 3-5-3)) State v. Patterson, 80 Ga. App. 450, 56 S.E.2d 195 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right of condemnation in state.</b> - Right of condemnation is in state, not in officers seizing property illegally used in conveying liquors or beverages, and law requiring solicitor (now prosecuting attorney) of county, city, or superior court having jurisdiction in county where seizure was made to institute condemnation proceedings, necessarily imply that such proceedings shall be in name of state. Fact that arresting officer may be interested financially in proceeds from condemnation does not make such officer a necessary party plaintiff in first instance. Thompson v. State, 74 Ga. App. 821, 41 S.E.2d 583 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right of state to condemn nonowner's equity in vehicle while protecting lien holder's interest.</b> - State can condemn equity, if any, in an automobile held by operator who illegally transports liquors and beverages therein although legal title to the automobile may be held by another. It is the intention of the legislature to protect bona fide lien holders without destroying right of state to condemn. Consolidated Loan Co. v. State, 75 Ga. App. 77, 41 S.E.2d 802 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proceeding brought in name of state.</b> - Proceeding for condemnation of vehicle used in illegally transporting prohibited liquors and beverages is properly brought in name of state. State v. Weaver, 87 Ga. App. 172, 73 S.E.2d 227 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Procedure.</b> - Sheriff or other peace officer must report property seized, because of its use in conveying illegal liquor, to solicitor (now prosecuting attorney) of court having jurisdiction within ten days after such seizure, and thereupon condemnation proceedings will be instituted as set forth. Kitchens v. Beverly, 86 Ga. App. 880, 72 S.E.2d 819 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Report by sheriff of seized property to prosecuting attorney.</b> - County sheriff, in no way connected with federal government, has no right by reason of his office to turn property over to federal authorities instead of making a report to proper prosecuting attorney in conformity with this section. Kitchens v. Beverly, 86 Ga. App. 880, 72 S.E.2d 819 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consequences of sheriff's turning contraband vehicle over to federal authorities.</b> - Where a sheriff, upon seizing a vehicle conveying illegal liquor, turns it over to the federal government for condemnation under the federal Internal Revenue Code, instead of reporting its seizure to the prosecuting attorney as required by state statute, the sheriff does so at the sheriff's peril as a private citizen seizing private property for forfeiture to the federal government. If, however, the officer turns the property over to proper federal authorities for condemnation in federal court in a proceeding regular on its face, of which owner of vehicle had due notice of time and place of trial thereof, act of state officer in turning property over to federal government for condemnation is thereby ratified by federal government and such adoption on its part is sufficient recognition and confirmation of seizure to give it an equal validity in law with an original seizure under proper authority by an agent of federal government. Kitchens v. Beverly, 86 Ga. App. 880, 72 S.E.2d 819 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Truck as contraband apparatus or appliance used in manufacture of moonshine.</b> - Pickup truck not alleged to have been used in conveying, removing, concealing, or storing of non-tax-paid liquor may not be declared contraband as some "apparatus or appliances" used in manufacture of moonshine. Vaughan v. State, 110 Ga. App. 709, 140 S.E.2d 66 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trover action against sheriff holding property more than 10 days.</b> - When seizure is effected contrary to this section, and sheriff attempts to hold vehicle in excess of 10 days without reporting the seizure, the sheriff is, as to plaintiff's property, mere trespasser, and trover action will lie against the sheriff for recovery of property.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of state and federal courts.</b> - The State of Georgia under this section, and the United States government under 26 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 2803, have concurrent jurisdiction, and each has power and authority to seize and condemn automobiles used in illegally transporting liquor. As to actions in rem, between state and federal court, the one first taking steps equivalent to exercising dominion over and possession of the res will have exclusive jurisdiction. Kitchens v.

Cummings v. State, 84 Ga. App. 698, 67 S.E.2d 156 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Arresting officer's not being party to action no ground for dismissal.</b> - In an action involving condemnation of vehicle allegedly used in illegally transporting prohibited liquors and beverages, and brought in name of state, in which arresting officer was not made a party in trial court, and trial court finds in favor of intervenor and against condemnation of vehicle, it is no ground for dismissal of bill of exceptions by court that arresting officer was not made a party in court, as the officer's interest is not adverse to that of state as plaintiff in error. State v. Weaver, 87 Ga. App. 172, 73 S.E.2d 227 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 58-207).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of intervenor's writ of error.</b> - Where, after seizure by two empowered officers, state condemned truck, and thereafter under order of court the truck was sold at public auction, after which a party intervened and claimed truck and, after court sustained demurrer (now motion to dismiss) filed by solicitor general (now district attorney) on behalf of state, the intervenor excepted and brought case to Supreme Court by writ of error, but served only state with copy of bill of exceptions, writ of error would be dismissed as state was only a formal or technical party, and two officers were real contestants. Carter v. State, 180 Ga. 578, 180 S.E. 110 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice to owner of condemnation of vehicle.</b> - A motor vehicle owned or leased by third party other than operator cannot be condemned without notice to such third person, if known, and without proving that the motor vehicle was being used for illegal transportation of contraband liquors by operator. Bentley v. State, 70 Ga. App. 494, 28 S.E.2d 658 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirement of service on officers making seizure.</b> - Since officers making seizure are necessary parties to a proceeding to condemn an automobile used in illegal transport of liquor and have an interest in proceeds from the sale of the vehicle, service of process should be had on them or acknowledgment of service by them. Alford v. State, 82 Ga. App. 79, 60 S.E.2d 431 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Service only of copy of petition on defendant.</b> - In an action instituted to condemn an automobile carrying intoxicating liquor, defendant must be served with copy of petition, but there is no requirement that process be issued.

<p class="p4"><b>When defense is filed in condemnation proceeding, case proceeds as other civil cases.</b> Grant v. State, 74 Ga. App. 493, 40 S.E.2d 406 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Required defenses of owners, lessees, and lien holders.</b> - Requirement as to showing proper registration of vehicle applies only to owner or lessee, and sole prerequisite as to lien holder is that the owner or lessee show that such illegal use was without the owner's or lessee's knowledge or consent. State v. McRee, 83 Ga. App. 284, 63 S.E.2d 348 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to allege registration of vehicle insufficient for dismissal.</b> - In proceeding by state to condemn vehicles found to be illegally transporting or conveying intoxicating liquor, failure of intervenor to allege that vehicle was legally registered with Department of Motor Vehicles (now Motor Vehicle Division of Department of Revenue) in true name and address of owner did not subject petition to demurrer (now motion to dismiss) and dismissal. State v. McRee, 83 Ga. App. 284, 63 S.E.2d 348 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegation of lack of knowledge of illegal use of vehicles sufficient.</b> - In proceeding to condemn automobile truck-tractor and trailer on ground that vehicles had been used in illegally transporting and conveying intoxicating liquor, petition of intervenor alleging that the use of vehicles was without knowledge, express or implied, was sufficient; it was not necessary for intervenor to allege both the intervenor's lack of knowledge of illegal use the intervenor of vehicle and also that such use was without the intervenor's connivance or consent because if the intervenor did not know of illegal use the intervenor could not have connived in or consented to such use. State v. McRee, 83 Ga. App. 284, 63 S.E.2d 348 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State's burden of proof not met.</b> - Where, in condemnation proceeding, the only evidence as to any actual use of automobile to convey alcoholic liquors was that it was standing in private way near a residence where 42 gallons of whiskey were seized, that two gallons of whiskey were taken from car, and that a person was seen approaching car with another gallon of whiskey, this evidence being equally if not more indicative that automobile was merely being prepared for use to transport liquor than that it had been so used, state did not meet burden of showing that this section had been violated. Thompson v. State, 52 Ga. App. 355, 183 S.E. 214 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof as to illegal use of vehicle.</b> - When the state shows illegal use of vehicle, burden then shifts to intervenor to show that illegal use of automobile was without the intervenor's knowledge, connivance, or consent, express or implied. Intervenor must also show that property seized, if a motor vehicle, was legally registered with Department of Motor Vehicles (now Motor Vehicle Division of Department of Revenue) in true name and address of such owner or the owner's predecessor in title, unless vehicle was bought new from dealer within 30 days of time of seizure. Strickland Motors, Inc. v. State, 81 Ga. App. 824, 60 S.E.2d 254 (1950); Simpson v. State, 82 Ga. App. 319, 60 S.E.2d 537 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Preparatory acts insufficient to evoke penalties of section.</b> - Acts merely preparatory to commission of quasi-criminal acts which, if completed, would subject automobile to condemnation under this section, are not sufficient to evoke penalties of section. Thompson v. State, 52 Ga. App. 355, 183 S.E. 214 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence insufficient to infer hitched team used in conveying moonshine.</b> - Evidence that team consisting of mules and wagon was found hitched at place where a still producing alcoholic liquor was in operation, and that there was some alcoholic liquor in wagon, was insufficient to authorize inference that team was used in conveying such liquors along public road or private way of this state. Leath v. Rosser, 52 Ga. App. 587, 183 S.E. 839 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence requiring new trial.</b> - In proceeding for condemnation of vehicle used in transporting liquor, where evidence showed that finance company did not have notice on date it purchased conditional sales contract in question that automobile buyer was engaged in dealing in liquor, trial court erred in overruling intervening finance company's motion for new trial. Liberal Fin. Co. v. State, 80 Ga. App. 697, 57 S.E.2d 220 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial denied where intervenor had notice of truck's use.</b> - New trial motion brought by intervenor claiming sole ownership in proceeding to condemn truck was properly denied, where conditional sale agreement for vehicle was dated prior to seizure, even though contract was actually made at later date, after seizure, at which time seller (intervenor) had notice of purposes for which truck was being used.
