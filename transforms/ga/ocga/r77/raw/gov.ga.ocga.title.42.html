<p class="p9">If any inmate of any state or county correctional institution, county or municipal jail, or other similar facility, while such inmate is in custody or in the process of being taken into custody, injures or has injured or contacts or has contacted a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, firefighter, emergency medical technician, or other person in such a manner as to present a possible threat of transmission of a communicable disease to the person so injured or contacted, then the warden, jailer, or other official having charge of such inmate may take all reasonable steps to determine whether the inmate has a communicable disease capable of being transmitted by the injury or contact involved. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, any appropriate medical examination of or collection of medical specimens from the inmate. In the event an inmate refuses to cooperate in any such procedures, the warden, jailer, or other official may apply to the superior court of the county for an order authorizing the use of any degree of force reasonably necessary to complete such procedures. Upon a showing of probable cause that the injury presents the threat of transmission of a communicable disease, the court shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to use reasonable measures to perform any medical procedures reasonably necessary to ascertain whether a communicable disease has been transmitted. In addition to any other grounds sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of such an order, such probable cause may be conclusively established by evidence of the injury or contact in question and a statement by a licensed physician that the nature of the injury or contact is such as to present a threat of transmission of a communicable disease if the inmate has such a disease. The cost of any procedures carried out under this Code section shall be borne by the jurisdiction having custody of the inmate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

L. 2006, p. 379, <span class="s1">§</span> 1/HB 1059, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds and declares that recidivist sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Many sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and some sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The General Assembly finds that this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. The General Assembly further finds that the high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(1) Incarcerating sexual offenders and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(2) Requiring the registration of sexual offenders, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(3) Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual offenders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(4) Collecting data relative to sexual offenses and sexual offenders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(5) Requiring sexual predators who are released into the community to wear an electronic monitoring system for the rest of their natural life and to pay for such system; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(6) Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"The General Assembly further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual offenders and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual offenders to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual offenders. The General Assembly declares that in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual offenders be registered and that members of the community and the public be notified of a sexual offender's presence. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes. Likewise, the designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from findings by the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board and a court if requested by a sexual offender." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Defendant who entered an Alford plea in 2000 to sex offenses as a first offender was properly required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the 2005 amendment to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12; the statute applies to first offenders convicted before July 1, 2004, and it is not an ex post facto law because if a defendant fails to register, the defendant will be guilty of a felony distinct from those crimes of which the defendant has been previously convicted. Watson v. State, 283 Ga. App. 635, 642 S.E.2d 328 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's conviction for violating O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(3) as a result of failing to renew the defendant's registration as a sex offender was upheld on appeal as the requirement to register as a sexual offender under <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(3) resulted in a new crime under <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(n) and was not an ex post facto law. Frazier v. State, 284 Ga. 638, 668 S.E.2d 646 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in revoking a convicted sexual offender's probation for failing to register an address change when the offender moved into a motel because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 was not unconstitutionally vague in failing to define the term "temporary residence"; nor does the statute's use of the term "temporary residence" in any way authorize or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, but rather, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(a)(16) sets forth in considerable detail the information that must be reported by a sexual offender. Dunn v. State, 286 Ga. 238, 686 S.E.2d 772 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in revoking a convicted sexual offender's probation for failing to register an address change after the offender moved into a motel because the offender failed to establish that the offender was treated differently from a similarly situated nonresident sexual offender entering the state; if O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(7) applies to a hypothetical nonresident sexual offender, that person must update his or her information within 72 hours of a change of address as required in <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(f)(5), and any nonresident sexual offender who is required to register by virtue of the specification of <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(7) is equally subject to the requirement that he or she register a new address within 72 hours of changing that address and equally subject to being charged with a violation. Dunn v. State, 286 Ga. 238, 686 S.E.2d 772 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because sexual offender registry requirements are regulatory, and not punitive the registry requirement is not a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; moreover, it is of no consequence whether a defendant has committed an offense that is "sexual" in nature before being required to register since the nature of the offense requiring the registration would not somehow change the registration requirements into a form of "punishment." Rainer v. State, 286 Ga. 675, 690 S.E.2d 827 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 does not violate substantive due process because <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 advances the state's legitimate goal of informing the public for purposes of protecting children from those who would harm the children, and it is not arbitrary to believe that a child may be more at risk of harm from someone who would falsely imprison the child and who is not the child's parent; the fact that a defendant's offense did not involve sexual activity is of no consequence because under the statute, one only needs to have committed a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor in order to meet the statutory definition of "sexual offender" for purposes of registration. Rainer v. State, 286 Ga. 675, 690 S.E.2d 827 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is commonly understood by persons of common intelligence that criminal conduct which is a sexual offense is, at a minimum, criminal conduct which involves genitalia. Inasmuch as the offense of cruelty to children is found in Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated and a defendant's conduct that led to the defendant's conviction is a sexual offense, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 is not unconstitutionally vague. Wiggins v. State, 288 Ga. 169, 702 S.E.2d 865 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2906, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1251, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 4005 (U.S. 2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Registration requirements for homeless sex offenders unconstitutionally vague.</b> - Defendant was entitled to quash an indictment charging the defendant with failure to register a new residence address under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 as the defendant, who was homeless and not living in a shelter, was not given an objective standard or guidelines as to how to register if the defendant did not have a street or route address; thus, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to homeless sex offenders without a street or route address. Santos v. State, 284 Ga. 514, 668 S.E.2d 676 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure of homeless to register.</b> - Defendant's conviction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 for failing to register as a sex offender was reversed because the record showed that the state has never contested the evidence showing the defendant's homeless status nor had the state ever alleged, either in the indictment or at trial, that, despite the defendant's homelessness, the defendant had a street or route address which the defendant failed to register with the sheriff's office. Chestnut v. State, 331 Ga. App. 69, 769 S.E.2d 779 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Classification implicated liberty interest.</b> - Defendant's classification as a sexually dangerous predator implicated a liberty interest as it required electronic monitoring and tracking, additional registration requirements, additional employment restrictions, and reputational harm associated with such a classification. Gregory v. Sexual Offender Registration Review Bd., 298 Ga. 675, 784 S.E.2d 392 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reliance on registration database.</b> - Defendant sergeant reasonably relied on the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's information that charges for failing to register as a sex offender were outstanding and that the plaintiff was last known to be in the sergeant's county; thus, verifying that the offender had not given the offender's address to the sheriff provided sufficient probable cause to seek an arrest warrant and a Fourth Amendment challenge properly failed; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(c) statutorily charged the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) with providing conviction data (including names and fingerprints) of persons required to register as sex offenders to local sheriffs, who in turn were charged with maintaining a list of their names and addresses, and the sergeant was in no position to challenge the information on the GBI database. Smith v. Greenlee, 289 Fed. Appx. 373 (11th Cir. 2008)(Unpublished). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As for defendant's argument that registering as a sex offender would have exposed the defendant to prosecution for reentry of a previously removed alien under 8 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1326, the court found no Fifth Amendment violation because the defendant could not show that anything the defendant would have been required to provide under Georgia's sex offender statute would have confronted the defendant with a substantial hazard of self-incrimination (there were no nationality, visa, or other immigration details required to be submitted); the cases defendant cited in support of the defendant's Fifth Amendment argument were distinguishable because those cases imposed a disclosure requirement largely designed to discover involvement in criminal activities, and the Sex Offender Registration Notification Act, 18 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 2250(a), was not designed to uncover criminal behavior, but was instead intended to protect the public from sex offenders by tracking the offenders' interstate movement. United States v. Simon-Marcos,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Feb. 2, 2010)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction.</b> - Nothing in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 makes the registration requirements conditional upon a sexual offender having been told of the need to register upon release. Instead, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 directs the official to give the registration information to a person who is required to register, which indicates that the sexual offender has an obligation to register which is independent of the notice given by the official. Petway v. State, 291 Ga. App. 301, 661 S.E.2d 667 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(7) clearly provides that convictions for rape and crimes relating to rape require registration as a sex offender, and the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. Jenkins v. State, 284 Ga. 642, 670 S.E.2d 425 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(7) does not give a nonresident sexual offender who falls under its definition license to remain in the state for fourteen consecutive days without providing notification to the appropriate sheriff because the statute brings such a person within the ambit of <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12; the obligations of those who are required to register are unaffected by the specifications in <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(7) because <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e) declares who shall register, and <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(f) prescribes the obligations of those persons. Dunn v. State, 286 Ga. 238, 686 S.E.2d 772 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly convicted the defendant of failing to register as a sexual offender under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(4) because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague absent the definition of the term sexually violent offense as the statute included offenses in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-6-22.2 and the defendant admitted the defendant knew the defendant was required to register. Youmans v. State, 291 Ga. 754, 732 S.E.2d 441 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion to enforce terms inadequate to address regulatory mechanism.</b> - Defendant's motion to enforce the terms and conditions of the defendant's sentence was ineffectual to address the regulatory mechanism requiring the defendant to register as a sex offender. Smith v. State, 328 Ga. App. 885, 763 S.E.2d 269 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Counseling requirement as precondition to parole.</b> - Prisoner who has not been convicted of a sex offense is entitled to due process before the state declares the prisoner to be a sex offender. While classification or designation as a sex offender under Georgia law is controlled by Georgia's Sex Offender Registration law, O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12, the Parole Board's counseling precondition was insufficiently stigmatizing to constitute a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest and to support a due process entitlement. Kramer v. Donald, 286 Fed. Appx. 674 (11th Cir. 2008)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When pardoned.</b> - Inclusion on the sex offender registry pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12 was a legal consequence of the underlying criminal offense and a disability imposed by law and the defendant's pardon by its express terms removed all disabilities under Georgia law resulting from the defendant's conviction and relieved all the legal consequences thereof, and restored all of the defendant's civil and political rights, excepting only the defendant's firearm rights.

However, no regulatory taking occurred with regard to prohibiting the sex offender from physically working at a business, pursuant to former <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-15(b)(1), in which the sex offender held an ownership interest in as there existed no prohibition on owning a business within 1,000 feet of any child care facility, church, school, or other area where minors congregated and the sex offender failed to show that physically working at the premises was necessary.

<p class="p4"><b>Change of residence.</b> - Trial court's conclusion that the state failed to present any competent evidence showing that the defendant had changed residences was erroneous because in the court's assessment of the evidence, the trial court erroneously determined that an investigator's testimony amounted to inadmissible hearsay; the investigator's testimony as to the declaration of the defendant's father that the defendant no longer lived at that residence was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement and was admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. Moreover, the circumstances presented by the evidence would authorize a rational trier of fact to find that the defendant had intended to change residences without notifying the local authorities as required; the evidence showed that the defendant had been living at the defendant's mother's residence for over two weeks, had not returned to the defendant's father's residence by the time the defendant was arrested, had failed to report for a scheduled meeting with a probation officer, and had not contacted the probation officer to explain the defendant's failure to report for the meeting or to provide any information as to the defendant's current residential status.

<p class="p4">Indictment was insufficient to withstand a general demurrer because the indictment did not allege that the defendant was a convicted sexual offender, that the defendant was required as a sexual offender to register the defendant's address with the sheriff of the county in which the defendant resided, the defendant previously resided in a county and had registered the defendant's address, or that the defendant changed the defendant's address to one in another county, and the indictment did not inform the defendant of what alleged action or inaction constituted a registration statute.

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of petition for release from requirement to register.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's petition for release from the requirement to register as a sexual offender for life as the defendant failed to make a prima facie showing that the defendant was no longer a substantial risk of reoffending since an agency abuse case was pending against the defendant, which required a child of the defendant to not bring any children around the defendant, and defendant characterized the conduct involving the child molestation of the defendant's three children as a mistake which everyone makes.

<p class="p4">Because the defendant's sex offender registration as part of probation was limited to the maximum sentence allowed by law as punishment for that crime, the trial court did not improperly give the defendant an indeterminate sentence by requiring the defendant to register as a sexual offender following the defendant's conviction for felony public indecency. Loya v. State, 321 Ga. App. 430, 740 S.E.2d 382 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Registration required when convicted as child sex offender.</b> - Defendant was properly ordered to register as a sex offender after a conviction for cruelty to a child since the cruelty as stated in the indictment was rape of a minor, a threat to arrest and jail the victim, and force used to make the victim touch the defendant's penis. Wiggins v. State, 272 Ga. App. 414, 612 S.E.2d 598 (2005), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 280 Ga. 268, 626 S.E.2d 118 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As the indictments made it clear that the underlying conduct for the two aggravated assaults to which the defendant entered Alford pleas was the oral sodomy of one minor and the rape of another, and the defendant was held to have notice of all lesser crimes shown by the facts alleged in the indictment, the defendant was required to register as a sex offender under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12. Rogers v. State, 297 Ga. App. 655, 678 S.E.2d 125 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction of failure to register as a sex offender, as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12, because when the defendant was charged with failure to register the defendant was required to register as a sex offender since the defendant had been convicted of criminal sexual conduct toward a minor in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-6-2, and the supreme court's ruling that <span class="s1">§</span> 16-6-2 infringed upon the right of privacy had to be applied retroactively on collateral review, but the court of appeals could not apply it in the defendant's case since it was not on collateral review; the appeal was from a conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, which was a proceeding separate from defendant's original offense, and at the time of the defendant's sodomy conviction, the conduct in which the defendant engaged was against the law in Georgia. Green v. State, 303 Ga. App. 210, 692 S.E.2d 784 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the addendum to the defendant's sentence purported to impose restrictions upon the defendant's future parole, if granted, the sentence was a nullity; however, in light of the testimony and the nature of the offense of which the defendant was convicted, incest, the conditions of probation imposed were reasonable and were not vague or overly broad because several of the conditions imposed were specifically mandated by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12, and even if the trial court had not specifically imposed sex offender registration as a condition of probation, the defendant was nonetheless required by statute to register. Stephens v. State, 305 Ga. App. 339, 699 S.E.2d 558 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Perpetrator 18 and victim 13 required registration.</b> - Trial court properly held that the defendant, who was convicted of a statutory rape that occurred when the defendant was 18 and the victim was 13, had to register as a sex offender. Because the victim was under 14, the case did not fall within the exception of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(a)(9)(C) for misdemeanor statutory rape under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-6-3(c); moreover, the defendant was prosecuted in superior court, not juvenile court.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Registration required when crime against minor.</b> - Based on the allegations in the defendant's second indictment that the defendant sucked on the breasts of a minor under the age of 16, the trial court was authorized to conclude that the defendant committed a criminal offense against a victim who was a minor and was thus subject to the registration requirements and conditions in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12. Phillips v. State, 298 Ga. App. 520, 680 S.E.2d 424 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's convictions for child molestation supported the trial court's requirement that the defendant register as a sex offender because the defendant's conviction constituted a conviction for criminal sexual conduct toward a minor and a dangerous sexual offense. Kruel v. State, 344 Ga. App. 256, 809 S.E.2d 491 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Electronically furnishing obscene materials required registration.</b> - Detective erroneously promised during an interview that a defendant would not be charged with an offense that required sex offender registration because a conviction for electronically furnishing obscene material to a minor under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-12-100.1 would require registration as a sex offender under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(2); prior to the erroneous promise, the defendant's confession was voluntarily made under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-3-50 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-8-824) as the confession was made without the slightest hope of benefit.

<p class="p4"><b>Internet sex crimes required registration.</b> - Defendant's convictions under the computer pornography and child exploitation act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-12-100.2, required registration as a sex offender pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12, as the conviction for pornography and child exploitation under <span class="s1">§</span> 16-12-100.2(d) for the use of an on-line Internet service in the attempt to commit child molestation, was within the definition of a "criminal offense against a victim who was a minor," pursuant to <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12; the defendant had communicated with a police officer who posed as a 14-year-old girl, sent her sexually explicit messages, and arranged a meeting with her.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Registration for "criminal offense against a minor" based on communication over the Internet.</b> - Trial court properly ordered the defendant to register as a sex offender, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12, although the defendant's convictions did not fit within the category of "sexually violent offenses," pursuant to <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12, as the offenses were all within the "criminal offense against a victim who was a minor" category, pursuant to <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12, based on a strict construction of the registration statute, pursuant to the statutory interpretation rules under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(a); the defendant's convictions arose for communications over the Internet with a police officer who posed as a young girl, and the defendant sent her sexually explicit messages and arranged a meeting with her, at which time the defendant was arrested.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conduct alleged in indictment satisfied definition of sexual offense and required registration.</b> - As a defendant entered an Alford plea to two counts of cruelty to children by committing the acts alleged in the indictment, the defendant acknowledged touching the breast and buttocks of the 14-year-old victim and although the defendant did not plead guilty to a sexual offense, the defendant pled guilty to conduct which, by the conduct's nature, was a sexual offense against a minor. Therefore, the defendant was required to register as a sexual offender under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(e)(1). Morrell v. State, 297 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Misdemeanor conviction for interference with child custody did not require registration.</b> - Trial court properly permanently enjoined the Georgia Department of Corrections from requiring the defendant to register as a sex offender because the defendant's State of Alabama conviction for interference with custody of a child was a misdemeanor conviction that did not trigger the sex offender registration requirement under Georgia law.

<p class="p4"><b>Statute not unconstitutional ex post facto law.</b> - Even though former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-13 was passed after a sex offender's statutory rape conviction, and used the prior conviction as an element of a future offense, it was not an ex post facto law since it only punished a future offense, which punishment was enhanced by the prior conviction, and the sex offender could only have been punished under former<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-13 if the offender prospectively chose to violate the statute by continuing to live at the offender's current home; the fact that the prior conviction subjected the sex offender to possible punishment under former <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-13 did not make the statute into an unconstitutional ex post facto law.

<p class="p4"><b>Unconsitutional when applied to sex offender's residence.</b> - In a declaratory action suit brought by a registered sex offender, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-15(a) was held unconstitutional as to the sex offender's residence, which was acquired prior to a child care facility locating itself within 1,000 feet of the property as forcing the sex offender from the home was a regulatory taking of the property without just and adequate compensation. However, no regulatory taking occurred with regard to prohibiting the sex offender from physically working at a business, pursuant to former <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-15(b)(1), in which the sex offender held an ownership interest in as there existed no prohibition on owning a business within 1,000 feet of any child care facility, church, school, or other area where minors congregated and the sex offender failed to show that physically working at the premises was necessary.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Life sentence for failing to register unconstitutional.</b> - Imposition of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment imposed against a defendant, who was a second time offender, for failing to register as a sexual offender was held unconstitutional as grossly disproportionate to the crime of failing to register.

<p class="p4"><b>Release from registration requirements proper.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in releasing the defendant from the sex offender registration requirements because under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-6.2(c)(1)(D), there was evidence that the underlying child molestation offense consisted of the defendant touching the genitals of the child victim with the defendant's hands; thus, the sexual offense did not rise to the level of intentional physical harm so as to preclude release from the registration requirements. State v. Randle, 331 Ga. App. 1, 769 S.E.2d 724 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Phrase "intentional physical harm," as it was used in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-6.2(c)(1)(D), providing conditions for release from the sex offender registry, meant intentional physical contact that caused actual physical damage, injury, or hurt to the victim; a sex offender registrant was entitled to release from registration because his unwanted touching of a ten-year-old boy's penis did not constitute such physical damage, injury, or hurt. State v. Randle, 298 Ga. 375, 781 S.E.2d 781 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of petition for release from requirement to register.</b> - Trial court erred when the court denied the defendant's petition for release from the requirement to register as a sex offender and failed to determine whether the defendant ever touched a woman who testified at the criminal trial without the woman's consent, thereby committing a sexual offense; thus, since neither the verdict nor the evidentiary ruling in the defendant's case conclusively established that the encounter was a "relevant similar transaction," further proceedings were necessary. Yelverton v. State of Georgia, 300 Ga. 312, 794 S.E.2d 613 (2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court was indeed authorized, after denying the petition to be released from the sex offender registration requirement on one specific ground and being reversed on appeal, to deny the petition a second time for a wholly different reason. Royster v. State of Ga., 346 Ga. App. 333, 814 S.E.2d 455 (2018). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's request to be released from the sex offender registration requirements as the record showed that the defendant was convicted of an intentional act of aggravated child molestation which resulted in physical injury to the victim when the defendant placed the defendant's finger inside the rectum of a child under the age of 14 years, with the intent to satisfy the sexual desires of the accused, and which resulted in physical injury to the child. Strickland v. State, 347 Ga. App. 216, 818 S.E.2d 675 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Second petition for release from registration improperly dismissed.</b> - Because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-19 barred a person on the sex offender registry from filing a second petition for release from registration requirements within two years from a final order on a previous petition, if the first petition for relief was denied, but the defendant's first petition was not denied as the petition was treated as either a voluntary dismissal or, alternatively, a dismissal for failure to prosecute, neither of which operated as an adjudication on the merits of the first petition, the trial court erred by dismissing the defendant's second petition for release from sex offender registration requirements as that petition was not filed within two years of the previous petition.

<p class="p9">The Governor, upon certification by the commissioner of corrections and approval by the director of the Office of Planning and Budget that the population of the prison system of the State of Georgia has exceeded the capacity of the prison system for any period of 90 consecutive days, beginning at any time after December 31, 1988, may declare a state of emergency with regard to jail and prison overcrowding. Following the declaration of such emergency, the department may establish additional facilities for use by the department, such facilities to be either of a permanent type of construction or of a temporary or movable type as the department may find most advantageous to the particular needs, to the end that the inmates under its supervision may be so distributed throughout the state as to facilitate individualization of treatment designed to prepare them for lawful living in the community where they are most likely to reside after their release from a correctional facility. For this purpose, the department may purchase or lease sites and suitable lands and erect necessary buildings thereon or purchase or lease existing facilities, all within the limits of appropriations as approved by the General Assembly. With the approval of the Governor, provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 50, relating to the Department of Administrative Services, or provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 or Chapter 22 of Title 50, relating to control over acquisition of professional services, may be waived by the department to facilitate the rapid construction or procurement of facilities for inmates; provided, however, that the authority to waive provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 shall terminate as of July 1, 1991. During any year in which correctional facilities are constructed or procured under this Code section and any requirements are waived, the department shall furnish the Governor and the General Assembly with a detailed report specifying the facilities constructed or procured, the requirements waived, and the reasons therefor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

While in such diversion program, the respondent shall be authorized to travel to and from his or her place of employment and to continue his or her occupation. The official in charge of the diversion program or his or her designee shall prescribe the routes, manner of travel, and periods of travel to be used by the respondent in attending to his or her occupation. If the respondent's occupation requires the respondent to travel away from his or her place of employment, the amount and conditions of such travel shall be approved by the official in charge of the diversion center or his or her designee. When the respondent is not traveling to or from his or her place of employment or engaging in his or her occupation, such respondent shall be confined in the diversion center during the term of the sentence. With the approval of the sheriff or his or her designee, the respondent may participate in educational or counseling programs offered at the diversion center. While participating in the diversion program, such respondent shall be liable for alimony or child support as previously ordered, including arrears, and his or her income shall be subject to the provisions of Code Sections 19-6-30 through 19-6-33.1 and Chapter 11 of Title 19. In addition, should any funds remain after payment of child support or alimony, such respondent may be charged a fee payable to the county operating the diversion program to cover the costs of his or her incarceration and the administration of the diversion program which fee shall be not more than $30.00 per day or the actual per diem cost of maintaining the respondent, whichever is less, for the entire period of time such respondent is confined to the diversion center and participating in the diversion program. If such respondent fails to comply with any of the requirements imposed upon him or her in accordance with this Code section, nothing shall prevent the sentencing judge from revoking such assignment to such diversion program and providing for alternative methods of incarceration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

With respect to state inmates housed in county correctional institutions, the department shall bear the costs of direct medical services required for emergency medical conditions posing an immediate threat to life or limb if the inmate cannot be placed in a state institution for the receipt of this care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The responsibility for payment will commence when the costs for direct medical services exceed an amount specified by rules and regulations of the Board of Corrections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The department will pay only the balance in excess of the specified amount. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, it shall remain the responsibility of the governmental unit having the physical custody of an inmate to bear the costs of such medical and hospital care, if the custody of the inmate has been transferred from the department pursuant to any order of any court within this state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The department shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations relative to payment of such medical and hospital costs by the department. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The officer in charge will provide an inmate access to medical services or hospital care and may arrange for the inmate's health insurance carrier to pay the health care provider for the services or care rendered as provided in Article 3 of Chapter 4 of this title. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(2) With respect to an inmate covered under Article 3 of Chapter 4 of this title, the costs of any medical services, emergency medical and hospital care, or follow-up medical or hospital care as provided in subsection (a) of this Code section for which a local governmental unit is responsible shall mean the costs of such medical services and hospital care which have not been paid by the inmate's health insurance carrier or the Department of Community Health. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Nothing in this Code section shall prohibit the Georgia Department of Corrections from negotiating higher fees or rates with health care providers.

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extent of duty.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-4-4 and 42-5-2 create an obligation merely to provide inmates with access to medical care and the county met that obligation by contracting with a local medical services provider to provide medical care to the detention center. Epps v. Gwinnett County, 231 Ga. App. 664, 499 S.E.2d 657 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When officers arrested a decedent who died shortly after the arrest, the officers and a city could not be held liable for violating O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-4-4 or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2 or by denying the decedent medical care because: (1) Code Section 42-4-4 imposed a duty only upon sheriffs and deputies; (2) Code Section 42-5-2 imposed a duty only on a governmental unit having physical custody of a detainee; and (3) the decedent was taken into custody by a county police officer and transported to a county jail, so the decedent was never in the custody of the city, and the suit could not be brought against the city under <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2. Hoyt v. Bacon County,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(S.D. Ga. Jan. 26, 2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the third amended complaint asserted a per se violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2, but to the extent that statute applied to the medical care provider by virtue of the provider's contract with the sheriff's office, the statute only created an obligation to provide detainees with access to medical care, but did not address the issue of proper medical care; because it was undisputed the deceased detainee was provided access to medical care, the trial court did not err in concluding that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2(a) provided no basis for a negligence per se claim against the medical care provider. Graham v. WellStar Health Sys., 338 Ga. App. 178, 789 S.E.2d 369 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County was responsible for detainee's medical care</b> after the detainee was injured while being taken into custody by the county sheriff's department and, but for the seriousness of the detainee's injuries, would have been placed in the county's detention facility. Cherokee County v. North Cobb Surgical Assocs., P.C., 221 Ga. App. 496, 471 S.E.2d 561 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation of prisoner's constitutional rights.</b> - When medical policies were promulgated and carried out under the mandate of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2 and the seriously ill prisoner was seen only by undertrained LPNs, not by a physician, before the prisoner died, this was a violation of a constitutional right that was coupled with causation. Howard v. City of Columbus, 239 Ga. App. 399, 521 S.E.2d 51 (1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1215, 120 S. Ct. 2218, 147 L. Ed. 2d 250 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of prisoners' funds for medical expenses.</b> - As it is the city's responsibility to pay all medical and hospital expenses for a prisoner in the city's custody, using a fund recovered from the prisoner after a shoot-out to pay these expenses, the city, in effect, appropriated the entire fund to itself. Johnson v. Mayor of Carrollton, 249 Ga. 173, 288 S.E.2d 565 (1982) (decided prior to 1982 amendment, which added last four sentences).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Department's right to recover from third-party tortfeasor.</b> - Although plaintiff Department of Corrections had a duty under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2(a) to provide medical care to the Department's inmates, this duty did not absolve the defendant driver of the driver's alleged liability for causing the inmates' injuries in an automobile accident; thus, the trial court erred in granting the driver summary judgment in the Department's suit against the driver to recover the Department's expenses incurred in treating the inmates' injuries. Dep't of Corr. v. Barkwell, 256 Ga. App. 877, 570 S.E.2d 13 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charged detainees are inmates.</b> - Term "inmate" means not only a person who has been convicted of an offense, but also a person who has been detained by reason of being charged with a crime, such that the county was responsible for the medical expenses of an individual arrested and charged with theft, regardless of the person's procedural status, and, additionally, of the self-inflicted nature of the person's injuries. Macon-Bibb County Hosp. Auth. v. Houston County, 207 Ga. App. 530, 428 S.E.2d 374 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Handcuffing of persons taken to hospital.</b> - In an action by a hospital seeking to recover the expenses of medical treatment provided to three men brought to the hospital by a county sheriff's deputy, the fact that the three men had been handcuffed for transportation to the hospital was not determinative of their subsequent status, when the handcuffs were removed. Macon-Bibb County Hosp. Auth. v. Reece, 236 Ga. App. 669, 513 S.E.2d 243 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact issue on custody determination.</b> - In an action by a hospital against the county seeking reimbursement for medical treatment provided detainees of the sheriff's department, issues of fact as to whether the individuals were in custody of the county when the expenses were incurred and whether the individuals were "inmates" precluded summary judgment for either the county or sheriff. Macon-Bibb County Hosp. Auth. v. Reece, 228 Ga. App. 532, 492 S.E.2d 292 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Deputy sheriff in the deputy's official capacity was entitled to sovereign immunity with respect to a former inmate's claims arising from denial of a dietary request; the sheriff's powers were derived from the state, and provision of food to county jail inmates was a state function. Lake v. Skelton, 840 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 1549, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 2492, 200 L. Ed. 2d 741 (U.S. 2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sovereign immunity.</b> - Providing adequate medical attention for inmates under the defendant's custody and control is a ministerial act by the sheriff and his or her deputies and does not involve the exercise of discretion; thus, such act is not subject to either sovereign immunity or official immunity. Cantrell v. Thurman, 231 Ga. App. 510, 499 S.E.2d 416 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2 imposes the duty and the cost for medical care of inmates in the custody of a county upon the county, it does not waive sovereign immunity of the county or the county's agents and employees. Howard v. City of Columbus, 239 Ga. App. 399, 521 S.E.2d 51 (1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1215, 120 S. Ct. 2218, 147 L. Ed. 2d 250 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Without proof by the administrator of the decedent inmate's estate that any actions undertaken by the county officers and employees sued for wrongful death amounted to wilfulness, malice, or corruption, they were entitled to official immunity as a matter of law; further, any failure to adopt other or additional requirements as to their policies of supervision and training in dealing with a suicidal inmate did not amount to wilfulness, malice, or corruption. Middlebrooks v. Bibb County, 261 Ga. App. 382, 582 S.E.2d 539 (2003), overruled in part Tattnall County v. Armstrong, 333 Ga. App. 46, 775 S.E.2d 573, 2015 Ga. App. LEXIS 446 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court incorrectly denied a prison official's motion for summary judgment on the estate administrators' 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1983 claim against the official, following an inmate's death from a Tylenol overdose, because, while the official was aware that the decedent faced a substantial risk of serious harm, the administrators did not show that the official displayed deliberate indifference to the decedent's serious medical needs. Furthermore, the administrators failed to prove that the official was acting outside the scope of the person's official duties or employment; consequently, even if the official acted with malice or intent to injure the decedent, the official was immune from liability on the administrators' state law claims against the official. Minor v. Barwick, 264 Ga. App. 327, 590 S.E.2d 754 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">County sheriff was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity because, under Georgia law, the sheriff was not acting as an arm of the state when caring for the medical needs of an inmate; instead, the sheriff was carrying out a statutory duty assigned to the county under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2(a). Dukes v. State, 428 F. Supp. 2d 1298 (N.D. Ga. 2006), aff'd, 212 Fed. Appx. 916 (11th Cir. 2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a parent's wrongful death action, the trial court erred in denying a county's motion for summary judgment because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2 did not waive the county's sovereign immunity for claims based on failure to provide medical care; Code Section 42-5-2 does not provide an express waiver, and nothing in the statute can be read to imply a waiver. Gish v. Thomas, 302 Ga. App. 854, 691 S.E.2d 900 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court correctly determined that the state law claims made against a county and against a sheriff and medical contract compliance administrator in their official capacities were barred because although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-2(a) imposed upon the county the duty and cost of medical care for inmates in the county's custody, the county did not waive sovereign immunity of the county or the county's agents or employees.

<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient evidence prison guard intended to distribute drugs in prison.</b> - Evidence supported convictions of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and crossing a prison guard line with drugs when the defendant, a corrections officer, was found with a cookie box containing drugs. Although the defendant claimed to be unaware of the contents of the package, none of the people the defendant named as being involved in the transaction were proven to exist, and the jury was authorized to infer that it was unreasonable for a corrections officer to take a suspicious package from an unknown person into a prison to give to an unknown recipient; furthermore, given the large amount and variety of contraband, its high street value, and that the defendant was taking it inside a heavily guarded prison facility, the jury was authorized to infer that the defendant intended to distribute the drugs to others instead of using the drugs personally.

<p class="p4">Defendant's conviction for the unauthorized possession of drugs by an inmate, contrary to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-18(b), was based on sufficient evidence as the evidence showed that during a confiscation and inventory of defendant's personal possessions, before moving the defendant to a new cell, a shampoo bottle containing a substance determined to be marijuana was discovered.

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of subsection (a).</b> - While it is commonly understood that a warden will have a permissible interest in the performance of labor by inmates under the waarden's control as that labor benefits the county or state, the clear meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-37 is that a warden may not receive a personal interest or benefit from the labor of inmates under the warden's control. Therefore, subsection (a) is not void for vagueness. Cleveland v. State, 260 Ga. 770, 399 S.E.2d 472 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Warden's use of inmate labor for personal benefit.</b> - Although, as warden, the defendant was permitted to live rent-free in a house located on county property, the county did not benefit from routine use of inmates to perform personal housekeeping chores at the warden's home, as well as to walk the warden's dogs and clean the dog pens, baby-sit the warden's children, and wash the warden's personal vehicles. Inmates who refused to perform these chores were punished. The extensive evidence that the warden directed inmates to perform labor for the warden's personal benefit supports the warden's convictions for violating subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-37 beyond a reasonable doubt.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, annotations decided under Ga. L. 1937, p. 758 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section is mandatory.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50 is mandatory in the statute's application; moreover, even if Whidden v. State, 160 Ga. App. 177, 287 S.E.2d 114 (1982), was applicable, the state failed to show that the defendant's removal to the state penitentiary while the defendant's appeal was pending was for the defendant's own safety, since the number of prisoners in the county jail was less than the jail's capacity. Helmeci v. State, 230 Ga. App. 866, 498 S.E.2d 326 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of a former clerk and a deputy clerk in an inmate's action alleging that they breached their duty to notify the department of corrections of the inmate's amended sentence as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50(a), because the court of appeals previously ruled in the case that the clerks were not entitled to official immunity in their individual capacities for failing to perform the ministerial act of communicating the inmate's sentence to the DOC, and nothing in the record following remand changed that ruling; Code Section 42-5-50(a) is imperative, and its performance is neither discretionary nor dependent upon a direction from the parties at interest. McGee v. Hicks, 303 Ga. App. 130, 693 S.E.2d 130 (2010), aff'd, 289 Ga. 573, 713 S.E.2d 841 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ministerial duties of clerk.</b> - Because the duties of a clerk of court to forward sentencing orders to the DOC as mandated by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50 were ministerial rather than discretionary, and were unambiguously triggered by the filing of a sentencing order which the clerk neglected to send, the clerk was not entitled to official immunity in a prisoner's case seeking damages for remaining incarcerated 22 months longer than necessary. Hicks v. McGee, 289 Ga. 573, 713 S.E.2d 841 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in determining that the court clerk properly discharged the clerk's duties regarding the recording and reporting of the inmate's 2011 criminal case because the printout from a Georgia Department of Corrections (GCIC) website did not evince that the clerk failed to report that the 2011 convictions had been reversed. The director of the records and reporting division with the clerk's office averred that the clerk, within 30 working days of the court's decision, notified GCIC of the court's reversal. Seibert v. Alexander, 351 Ga. App. 446, 829 S.E.2d 473 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language in sentence designating place of incarceration surplusage but not void.</b> - When one guilty of a misdemeanor is sentenced to be "confined at labor at the State Penitentiary at Reidsville, Georgia (Georgia State Prison), or such other place as the proper authority may direct," such portion of the sentence as seeks to designate the place of confinement, when no effort so to confine the prisoner is shown and since the director of the department of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) designates where most sentences are served, is mere surplusage, and, though technically not in the right form, is not such an irregularity as is hurtful to any right of liberty, or such a defect as makes the sentence void. Mathis v. Scott, 199 Ga. 743, 35 S.E.2d 285 (1945) (decided under Ga. L. 1937, p. 758).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of continuous tort doctrine to alleged violation.</b> - O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-33, under the continuous tort doctrine, did not bar a former inmate's negligence claim against two court clerks, based on their alleged failure to communicate the inmate's sentence to the Department of Corrections as the clerks' violation of their continuing duty to communicate the inmate's sentence to the Department resulted in continuous injury in the form of an ever-increasing illegal confinement that was not eliminated until the inmate was released from prison; hence, the trial court erred in finding that the claim was time-barred. Hicks v. McGee, 283 Ga. App. 678, 642 S.E.2d 379 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 512 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Reversal of conviction not remedy.</b> - Defendant could not obtain a reversal of defendant's conviction due to an alleged violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50(c) by defendant's transfer to the state penitentiary after the defendant's conviction as: (1) defendant never obtained a ruling on the defendant's O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50(c) motion, which waived the defendant's allegation of error for appeal purposes; (2) O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50(c) did not provide for reversal of a conviction if a trial court refused to keep a convicted defendant in the county jail; and (3) the defendant failed to show that the results of the defendant's appeal would have been different had the defendant been held in the county jail. Carter v. State, 267 Ga. App. 520, 600 S.E.2d 637 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failing to keep defendant in jail.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50(c) does not provide for reversal of a conviction if a trial court refuses to keep a convicted defendant in the county jail. Wilbanks v. State, 251 Ga. App. 248, 554 S.E.2d 248 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section did not provide sufficient grounds to prevent extradition.</b> - Trial court properly denied a prisoner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-13-30 seeking to block extradition; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50 did not prevent the defendant from being extradited while defendant's motion for a new trial was pending. Instead O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50 addresses the situation in which defense counsel certifies to the court that it is required that the convicted person remain in the local jail or lockup rather than being transferred to the assigned correctional institution in order to properly prosecute an appeal of the conviction. Bradford v. Brown, 277 Ga. 92, 586 S.E.2d 631 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Custody of defendant pending appeal in extraordinary circumstances.</b> - Following the conviction of the defendant, a former sheriff, for murdering a successful electoral opponent, the trial court did not violate O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50(c) by denying the defense counsel's requests that the defendant remain housed in a county facility so as to give counsel access to the defendant for purposes of prosecuting an appeal because the defendant was a high security risk, and the defendant's status as a former law enforcement officer required rotating the defendant's placement in metropolitan jails. Dorsey v. State, 279 Ga. 534, 615 S.E.2d 512 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absent evidence of defendant's inducement guilty plea not void.</b> - Defendant's dissatisfaction as to the defendant's incarceration in an institution other than one recommended by the court does not render the defendant's guilty plea void when there is no evidence that it constituted a part of the inducement to enter the plea.

<p class="p4"><b>Finality of board's decisions.</b> - Board controls prison system and the board's administrative decisions are final absent violation of rights enforceable in the courts; thus, enumeration of error is waived when the defendant admits that the trial court and the district attorney kept their part of the agreement.

<p class="p4"><b>Summons in lieu of indictment or accusation.</b> - When an inmate has been brought to trial and convicted upon a summons, rather than an indictment or an accusation, the clerk of the court in which the conviction was returned must furnish to the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) a certified copy of that summons; in such cases, the certified copy of the summons stands in lieu of an indictment or accusation. 1969 Op.

<p class="p4">Because the General Assembly contemplated receipt of the document specifying the charge of which the inmate had been found guilty, a clerk's certification that the indictment is lost is not sufficient replacement for a certified copy of the actual indictment. 1969 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Whether punishment computed on basis of felony or misdemeanor.</b> - Whether punishment is computed on the basis of a felony or a misdemeanor sentence is controlled by the conviction; a prisoner is either a misdemeanant or a felon, dependent on the crime for which the prisoner was convicted. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-49. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The county wherein the sentence is imposed shall have the sole responsibility of executing the sentence and of providing for the care, maintenance, and upkeep of the inmate while serving such sentence; provided, however, that, where the sentencing judge certifies to the department that the county facilities of that county are inadequate for maintaining female inmates, any female inmate may be committed to the department to serve her sentence in a state correctional institution, as may be directed by the department; provided, further, that the delivery of the female inmates to the proper place of incarceration shall be at the expense of the county of conviction. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p9">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After proper documentation is received from the clerk of the court, the department shall have 15 days to transfer an inmate under sentence to the place of confinement. If the inmate is not transferred within the 15 days, the department shall reimburse the county, in a sum not less than $7.50 per day per inmate and in such an amount as may be appropriated for this purpose by the General Assembly, for the cost of the incarceration, commencing 15 days after proper documentation is received by the department from the clerk of the court; provided, however, that, subject to an appropriation of funds, local governing authorities that have entered into memorandums of understanding or agreement or that demonstrate continuous attempts to enter into memorandums of understanding or agreement with the federal government under Section 287(g) of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act shall receive an additional payment in the amount of 10 percent of the established rate paid for reimbursement for the confinement of state inmates in local confinement facilities. The reimbursement provisions of this Code section shall only apply to payment for the incarceration of felony inmates available for transfer to the department, except inmates under death sentence awaiting transfer after their initial trial, and shall not apply to inmates who were incarcerated under the custody of the commissioner at the time they were returned to the county jail for trial on additional charges or returned to the county jail for any other purposes, including for the purpose of a new trial. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notwithstanding any language in the sentence as passed by the court, the commissioner may designate as a place of confinement any available, suitable, and appropriate state or county correctional institution in this state operated under the jurisdiction or supervision of the department. The commissioner shall also have sole authority to transfer inmates from one state or county correctional institution in this state to any other such institution operated by or under the jurisdiction or supervision of or approved by the board. Neither male nor female state inmates shall be assigned to serve in any manner in a county jail unless they are participating in a state sponsored project and have the approval of the commissioner and the sheriff or the jail administrator of the county. Furthermore, the commissioner may transfer to the Attorney General of the United States for confinement any inmate if it is determined that the custody, care, treatment, training, or rehabilitation of the inmate has not been adequate or in the best interest of the inmate or his fellow inmates. The commissioner is authorized to contract with the Attorney General of the United States for the custody, care, subsistence, housing, treatment, training, and rehabilitation of such inmates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Function of the prison commission</b> (now Board of Corrections) is to enforce sentences that are lawfully imposed, and the question as to whether a court is acting within the court's jurisdiction in modifying a sentence is in nowise affected by this section. Gobles v. Hayes, 194 Ga. 297, 21 S.E.2d 624 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 77-313).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Board of Corrections controls prison system</b> and the Board's administrative decisions are final absent violation of rights enforceable in the courts; this enumeration of error is waived if the defendant admits that the trial court and the district attorney have kept their part of the agreement. Overby v. State, 150 Ga. App. 319, 257 S.E.2d 386 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standing.</b> - Because a county could sue the state agencies by challenging the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-9-49 and 42-5-51(c) (regarding reimbursement of the detention costs of certain state inmates), and because the county did not dispute that the agencies complied with the sections, the trial court should have granted the agencies' motion for summary judgment. Ga. Dep't of Corr. v. Chatham County, 274 Ga. App. 865, 619 S.E.2d 373 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County was without authority.</b> - Since the defendant was sentenced as a felon upon the defendant's plea of guilty to the felony of making terroristic threats and misdemeanor battery, the court did not have authority to sentence the defendant to a county jail and the county had no authority to calculate the defendant's jail time. Eubanks v. State, 229 Ga. App. 667, 494 S.E.2d 564 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absent evidence of defendant's inducement guilty plea not void.</b> - Defendant's dissatisfaction as to the defendant's incarceration in an institution other than the one recommended by the court does not render the defendant's guilty plea void, when there is no evidence that it constituted a part of the inducement to enter the plea. Overby v. State, 150 Ga. App. 319, 257 S.E.2d 386 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language in sentence designating place of incarceration surplusage.</b> - When one guilty of a misdemeanor is sentenced to be "confined at labor at the State Penitentiary (Georgia State Prison) at Reidsville, Georgia, or such other place as the proper authority may direct," such portion of the sentence as seeks to designate the place of confinement, when no effort so to confine the prisoner is shown and since the director of the department of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) designates where most sentences are served, is mere surplusage, and, though technically not in the right form, is not such an irregularity as is hurtful to any right of liberty, or such a defect as makes the sentence void. Mathis v. Scott, 199 Ga. 743, 35 S.E.2d 285 (1945) (decided under Ga. L. 1937, p. 758). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court cannot require the Department of Corrections to place a convicted felon in a particular facility; however, language in a sentence purporting to designate a place of confinement is mere surplusage and is not a defect that will render the sentence void. Stewart v. State, 285 Ga. App. 760, 647 S.E.2d 411 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Superior court empowered to transfer habeas corpus petitioner.</b> - Superior court in this state has the power to order a habeas corpus petitioner under sentence of state court transferred from one penal institution to another, when this is necessary to grant the petitioner's constitutional right to meaningful access to the courts. To the extent that there exists a conflict between the statutory authority vested in the department to transfer prisoners from one correctional institute to another, and the authority vested in the superior court to enforce the Constitution, the former must yield to the latter. James v. Hight, 251 Ga. 563, 307 S.E.2d 660 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant once imprisonment imposed.</b> - Once a felony conviction was entered, and a defendant was sentenced to incarceration, the trial court lacked the authority to designate where that defendant must serve the incarceration, since this decision lies solely with the Department of Corrections under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-51(b).

<p class="p4"><b>Board designated sole agency for reception and assignment.</b> - As a general rule, the legislature has designated the Board of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) sole agency for reception and assignment of convicted misdemeanants and felons. Notable exceptions to this general provision concern individuals convicted of misdemeanors who, under certain conditions, must be placed in a county institution and, under other conditions, may be placed in such facilities in the discretion of the trial court; and one notable exception provides that the Division for Children and Youth is designated the exclusive state agency for the acceptance and incarceration of all misdemeanants and felons under the age of 17 years; provided, however, that those felons convicted of a capital felony shall only be sentenced into the custody of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections). 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restriction and discretion on releasing and assigning youthful offenders.</b> - When a combination of youthful offender and standard sentences occur, the Youthful Offender Division may not approve a conditional or unconditional release for the described youthful offender until the youth's concurrent standard sentence has expired; nevertheless, the youth could be assigned to an institution maintained primarily for youthful offenders during the entire period for which the board is charged with custody over the youth, since Ga. L. 1956, p. 161 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-50(b) and subsections (b) and (d) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-51) empowers the board to assign inmates to any institution within its system, and the statutory law authorizes the director of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) to segregate youthful offenders from other prisoners. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-82.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defined class of offenders set out.</b> - Ga. L. 1970, p. 451, <span class="s1">§</span> 3 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-7) set apart a defined class of offenders and directed how those offenders were to be punished for the offense; in doing this, the power of any superior court to try an individual under the age of 17 for any given crime was in no way affected; in this respect, Ga. L. 1970, p. 451, <span class="s1">§</span> 3 was like Ga. L. 1968, p. 1399, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-51) which provides that the commissioner of corrections and not the sentencing court designates the place of confinement of any individual within the court's jurisdiction. 1972 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Whether punishment computed on basis of felony or misdemeanor.</b> - Whether punishment is computed on the basis of a felony or a misdemeanor sentence is controlled by the conviction; a prisoner is either a misdemeanant or a felon, dependent on the crime for which the prisoner was convicted. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-49. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language in sentence designating place of incarceration.</b> - All felons and misdemeanants, other than those misdemeanants committed directly to a county public works camp (now county correctional institution), must be committed directly and exclusively to the Board of Corrections; only the director of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) is authorized to prescribe the place of confinement; so much of the language of a sentence committing an inmate to a term of penal servitude in the state prison system as purports to commit the inmate to Central State Hospital is surplusage and should not be relied upon by the officials of the hospital or the Board of Corrections as authority for the retention of custody of the inmate at the hospital. 1970 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - This statute was intended to alleviate hardships which prisoners encounter on reentry into free society; this policy would apply to a second release as well as a first, especially the inmate who was unsuccessful in the inmate's first attempt to make the social adjustment to freedom. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-102.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9">The warden or superintendent of any penal institution in which inmates committed to the custody of the commissioner have been assigned may authorize, without the prior written approval of the commissioner, emergency leave to an inmate when it is confirmed that there exists a serious illness or death in the inmate's immediate family and when notice and confirmation of the illness or death does not reach the warden or superintendent in time to authorize special leave in the manner provided in Code Section 42-5-81. Emergency leave cannot be granted under this Code section to any inmate who has been convicted of a sex offense, who has escaped or attempted to escape within 12 months preceding the emergency, who has not served sufficient time to demonstrate his responsibility and dependability, or who has an assaultive pattern determined to exist either from the nature of the offense for which he has been convicted or from conduct while incarcerated in the penal institution. The warden or superintendent granting the emergency leave must forward immediately a written report of the action to the commissioner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The prisoner may be permitted to call witnesses and present evidence consistent with the needs of the institution. There is no constitutional right to confrontation, cross-examination, or counsel.

<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of court over good-time allowances.</b> - Sentence of confinement for a period of two years is fully served at the time the executive department releases the prisoner, and any attempt by a court to impose the court's will over the executive department as to what constitutes service of a period of confinement would be a nullity and constitute an exercise of power granted exclusively to the executive department.

<p class="p4"><b>Two sentences served concurrently.</b> - When a person was convicted of two felonies, and served the person's sentences concurrently, so that the person was entitled to be released upon termination of the longer sentence, the person could not have such term reduced on account of good conduct by calculating an allowance for good conduct on each of the two sentences, and deducting the aggregate time from the longer sentence.

<p class="p4"><b>Forfeiture of good-time allowance because of escape.</b> - Punishment by forfeiture of good-time allowances for escape is executive punishment and does not prevent prosecution for the same offense in a court of law.

<p class="p4"><b>Fundamental public policy underlying section</b> is orderly administration of penitentiary service of prisoners, which is enhanced by a system of rewards in which the prisoner participates through a reduction of time served; the state also benefits through a lessening of ever constant discipline problems. The state receives no benefit by awarding statutory good time to an individual not "in any prison or county public works camp (now county correctional institution) operated under the jurisdiction of the board." This section was passed to benefit both the state and the prisoner. Since the state is not benefited directly when the prisoner is not under the jurisdiction of the board, the application of the provision dealing with statutory good time would be unauthorized. 1963-65 Op.

Further, in the rare case when a youthful offender is also classified as a habitual offender, earned-time adjustment for habitual offenders should be used in computing the offender's unconditional release date. 1981 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisite for computation of good-time allowances and deductions.</b> - With the limited exception of <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-5 relating to temporary custody of convicted inmates in county facilities, good-time allowances and deductions therefrom can only be computed when inmates are under the jurisdiction and control of the institutions operated by the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections); moreover, with the limited exception of <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-5, neither sheriffs nor the department can take jail credit away from inmates who have misbehaved in jails prior to their being sent to correctional institutions. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-61.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Penal systems not operated by board.</b> - The Board of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) has authority to adopt a policy under which the commissioner may designate penal systems other than those operated by the board as places of confinement for service of state sentences when concurrent sentences are imposed; this practice would enable a prisoner to earn all possible good time even though not actually serving his sentence in a state institution. 1963-65 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 240.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where one has probated sentence to serve upon completion of in-prison time,</b> probated sentence with its accompanying supervision begins upon discharge of inmate from confinement and continues to run through the period of time originally prescribed for the probated sentence; to allow the inmate to begin his probated sentence when he ordinarily would have been discharged from his in-prison sentence without the good-time allowances, is to allow the inmate to return to society without the benefit and guidance of supervision and without the help the court needs to become aware of violations by the probationer. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-48.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requests for retention of custody of inmate by county probation department.</b> - Requests from a county probation department for the retention of custody of an inmate pending the arrival of a deputy sheriff or a probation officer must be disregarded by the wardens. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-151.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prisoners at Central State Hospital.</b> - Board of Corrections has the power to promulgate rules and regulations as to good-time allowances which are applicable to prisoners transferred to Central State Hospital due to mental illness. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-146.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time spent by felon incarcerated under Department of Human Resources</b> not to be considered when computing good-time allowances; rather, good time should be computed from the date the felon is received by an institution under the Board of Corrections' jurisdiction. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-78. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a sentence begins running from the time of incarceration under the Department of Human Resources, the prisoner must serve one-third of the time to which he has been sentenced, including the time he has spent in the custody of the Department of Human Resources before becoming eligible for parole. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-78.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of prisoner's acquittal in escape trial.</b> - The fact that a prisoner was acquitted in a trial on a charge of escape has no legal effect on the authority of the Board of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) to deduct from prisoner's good-time allowance for such an escape. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-234.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Means of computing good-time allowance.</b> - The word "only" in <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-4 should be read as negating any implication that good-time allowances for persons sentenced under that section should be computed in the same manner as for persons convicted of ordinary misdemeanors under this section. 1972 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Congressional intent.</b> - Congress has provided in Ga. L. 1972, p. 932 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42) an efficient and effective method for resolving a prisoner's claim that the prisoner has been denied a speedy trial and is, therefore, subject to an illegal detainer. Requiring resort to remedies under Ga. L. 1972, p. 932 will remove the necessity of intervention by the federal courts, furthering the established principle of comity between state and federal courts. Hurst v. Hogan, 435 F.

<p class="p4"><b>Right to a speedy trial.</b> - Ga. L. 1972, p. 932 (see now O.C.G.A.

The agreement has provisions for sanctions if a speedy disposition of the pending indictment is not effected. If trial is not held within 120 days of the arrival of the movant within the jurisdiction of the court in which the indictment is pending and before the movant is returned to the jurisdiction of the sending state, the untried indictment shall be dismissed with prejudice.

<p class="p4"><b>Invocation of article by nonpresent defendant.</b> - In order for a demand for trial pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-7-170 to serve as the predicate for an absolute acquittal because of the failure of compliance therewith, it is necessary that the filing comply with the provisions of that statute, but a defendant who is not able to satisfy <span class="s1">§</span> 17-7-170 and thus not available to pursue the defendant's remedy in the appropriate state court is still not without remedy, since the defendant can invoke the provisions of O.C.G.A.

<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisite to seeking habeas corpus.</b> - When a prisoner in federal custody seeks to challenge a detainer lodged against the prisoner by officials of a state other than that in which the prisoner is incarcerated, the prisoner must exhaust the prisoner's remedies under Ga.

<p class="p9">The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, information or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures. <br>

The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by the certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner.

<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability.</b> - Ga. L. 1972, p. 938 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42) by its terms relates only to an untried indictment, information, or complaint and does not apply to warrants for arrest for probation violation. Suggs v. Hopper, 234 Ga. 242, 215 S.E.2d 246 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ga. L. 1972, p. 938 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42) does not address itself to transfers from the receiving jurisdiction back to the sending jurisdiction either after trial or after sentencing. State v. Sassoon, 240 Ga. 745, 242 S.E.2d 121 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Detainer based on an arrest warrant for pending criminal charges does not trigger the protections of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20. State v. Carlton, 276 Ga. 693, 583 S.E.2d 1 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Speedy trial provisions.</b> - It is clear from the language of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20, that its speedy trial provisions apply exclusively to untried indictments, informations, or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner. Morrison v. State, 272 Ga. App. 34, 611 S.E.2d 720, aff'd, 280 Ga. 222, 626 S.E.2d 500 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure to comply with article.</b> - Since the appellant failed to comply with the requirements of Ga. L. 1972, p. 938 (see now O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 42) the noncompliance renders the defendant's request for trial invalid. Greathouse v. State, 156 Ga. App. 491, 274 S.E.2d 835 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an escapee from a Florida prison committed crimes in Georgia, before being caught and returned to Florida, and was indicted in Georgia but did not comply with the procedures under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20 to trigger the 180-day rule, the defendant was not denied a speedy trial. Cothern v. State, 195 Ga. App. 513, 393 S.E.2d 763 (1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">State violated the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20, by continuing to hold a defendant in Georgia following the dismissal of the terroristic threats charge specified in the detainer, but the defendant was not prejudiced by the error as the defendant could have been tried in Georgia after serving the federal sentence. Morrison v. State, 272 Ga. App. 34, 611 S.E.2d 720, aff'd, 280 Ga. 222, 626 S.E.2d 500 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in dismissing a Columbia County indictment against the defendant, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20, as the state failed to bring the defendant to trial upon a return from imprisonment in South Carolina to face charges in Lincoln County; moreover, the defendant's request for disposition of all untried indictments applied equally to Columbia County as it did to Lincoln County. State v. Thompson, 284 Ga. App. 744, 644 S.E.2d 889 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to comply excusable.</b> - When the state showed that the reason for the delay in trying the defendant was due to, inter alia, conflicts of previously appointed defense counsel and requests for continuance from defense counsel, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's plea in bar for failure to try the defendant within 180 days pursuant to the Interstate Detainer Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20, et seq. King v. State, 268 Ga. App. 811, 603 S.E.2d 88 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to comply with procedural requirements.</b> - Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice because the defendant never waived extradition for trial on the indictment or requested a final disposition of the detainer based thereon. Therefore, the defendant did not comply with the procedural requirements of the Georgia Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20 et seq., the 180-day deadline was never triggered, and there was no violation of the IAD. Herbert v. State, 288 Ga. 843, 708 S.E.2d 260 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction.</b> - Despite the fact that drug and firearm charges filed against a detainee were not listed in the detainer, the convictions were upheld on appeal as the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20 et seq., neither granted nor divested a trial court's jurisdiction; while the better practice would have been for the state to include all charges for which the detainee was prosecuted within the detainer, it did not sacrifice jurisdiction by failing to do so. Morrison v. State, 280 Ga. 222, 626 S.E.2d 500 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impact of incarceration outside of state on speedy trial issues.</b> - Trial court properly denied the defendant's plea in bar based on speedy-trial grounds because the defendant's incarceration in Michigan extended the time for the defendant's speedy trial demand as the defendant was not available for trial because the defendant was in the custody of a different sovereign and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20 et seq., did not apply; there was no inherent authority in a Georgia court to compel the defendant's presence or in-court attendance since the defendant was incarcerated by or in the control of a different sovereign, specifically Michigan; and nothing in the record reflected the defendant's desire to waive the defendant's right to be present at trial. Gosline v. State, 341 Ga. App. 708, 802 S.E.2d 275 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of lodging detainer.</b> - Lodging of a detainer by the proper officials of this state against a person serving a term of imprisonment in the correctional institution of a sister state does not violate the provisions of U.S. Const., amends. 6, 8 and 14 or Ga. Const. 1945, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI). Pollard v. State, 128 Ga. App. 470, 197 S.E.2d 158 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><b>1. Article III</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One hundred eighty-day provision not inflexible.</b> - This agreement does not contemplate that the 180-day provision is inflexible. Duchac v. State, 151 Ga. App. 374, 259 S.E.2d 740 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Holding that the state may ignore a prisoner's request until shortly before the expiration of the 180-day period provided in Article III, and then extend that period by initiating proceedings under Article IV, would effectively nullify the purpose of the 180-day provision of Article III and deny to a prisoner the right to a speedy trial. Duchac v. State, 151 Ga. App. 374, 259 S.E.2d 740 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delay in bringing defendant to trial.</b> - When any delay in bringing the defendant to trial within the time prescribed by Art. III(a) was precipitated by the defendant's agreement to a joint recommendation, the defendant cannot complain that the defendant was not brought to trial in a timely manner. Smith v. State, 202 Ga. App. 362, 414 S.E.2d 504 (1991), cert. denied, 202 Ga. App. 907, 414 S.E.2d 504 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to begin trial within time limit.</b> - Article III does not say that the untried indictment shall be dismissed if the prisoner is not brought to trial within 180 days after the prisoner has served the prisoner's request for final disposition upon the proper Georgia authorities. Price v. State, 237 Ga. 352, 227 S.E.2d 368 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Strict compliance with notice provisions required.</b> - Facsimile transmission of the defendant's request for final disposition was insufficient as a matter of law since it was required to be sent by registered or certified mail. Clater v. State, 266 Ga. 511, 467 S.E.2d 537 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant's direct notice of disposition.</b> - Since the defendant sent the defendant's request for a disposition of the charges directly to the state without a warden's certificate of an inmate's status, rather than through prison authorities, and the required certificate was eventually supplied at a later date, the 180-day period provided in Article III began to run once the state received the certificate rather than when the state received the defendant's direct request. Thompson v. State, 186 Ga. App. 379, 367 S.E.2d 247, cert. denied, 186 Ga. App. 919, 367 S.E.2d 247 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When guilt not questioned, no relief for violation.</b> - Violation of the speedy trial provision (Article III(a)) will support no post-conviction relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 2254 when the petitioner alleges no facts casting substantial doubt on the state trial's reliability on the question of guilt. Seymore v. Alabama, 846 F.2d 1355 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1018, 109 S. Ct. 816, 102 L. Ed. 2d 806 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Foreign jurisdiction's delay not dispositive.</b> - When the defendant was tried within 180 days after the requisite documents were filed with all entities required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20 and when the initial failure to forward the detainer demand to the proper court was the result of a mistake by out-of-state authorities, there was no violation of <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20. Parrott v. State, 206 Ga. App. 829, 427 S.E.2d 276 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of charges improper.</b> - Because the 180-day period in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-6-20, Art. III(a), during which the defendant was required to be brought to trial, had not expired when the trial court entered the court's dismissal order, and because there was no basis for finding waiver, the trial court erred in dismissing the charges against the defendant with prejudice. State v. McCarter, 314 Ga. App. 542, 724 S.E.2d 843 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>2. Article IV</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grace period inapplicable when U.S. government a sending state.</b> - The 30-day rule in paragraph (a) of Article IV which provides for a period of 30 days after a request for temporary custody or availability before such request be honored, would appear to be inapplicable when the United States government is the sending state. Reaves v. State, 242 Ga. 542, 250 S.E.2d 376 (1978), overruled on other grounds, Felker v. State, 252 Ga. 351, 314 S.E.2d 621 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tacking time limits of Articles III and IV not permitted.</b> - The 120-day provisions of Article IV may not be added to the 180-day provisions of Article III, once a proper request under Article III has been made by the prisoner. Duchac v. State, 151 Ga. App. 374, 259 S.E.2d 740 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tolling time limit.</b> - Court was authorized to find that the 120-day time limit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was tolled by delay occasioned by the appellant's numerous pretrial motions in the face of the state's good-faith efforts to expedite the trial. Cobb v. State, 244 Ga. 344, 260 S.E.2d 60 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Missing 120-day limit by one week.</b> - Defendant could not complain that the state missed by one week beginning the defendant's trial within 120 days of the defendant's return to Georgia, when a trial date had been set with the agreement of the defendant's attorney, the defendant was returned to Georgia earlier than anticipated and then filed over 60 motions which necessarily had to be determined before trial, and the defendant did not raise any objections to the date set for trial until one day after the 120-day period had elapsed. Moon v. State, 258 Ga. 748, 375 S.E.2d 442 (1988), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 982, 111 S. Ct. 1638, 113 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1991), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Zant v.

<p class="p4"><b>Right to pretransfer hearing.</b> - Prisoner incarcerated in a jurisdiction that has adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act is entitled to the procedural protections of that Act, particularly the right to a pretransfer hearing before being transferred to another jurisdiction, pursuant to Art. IV of the Detainer Agreement. Lambert v. Jones, 250 Ga. 603, 299 S.E.2d 716 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extent of proper inquiries.</b> - Proper inquiries at pretransfer hearings are limited to whether the extradition documents on their face are in order; whether the petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding state; whether the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition; and whether the petitioner is a fugitive. Lambert v. Jones, 250 Ga. 603, 299 S.E.2d 716 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>3. Article V</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of issuance of habeas corpus writ.</b> - Once a detainer has been lodged against a prisoner and the prisoner has been removed from the prisoner's original place of imprisonment to the receiving state, the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to compel the prisoner's presence at trial is a request for temporary custody within the meaning of this section. Reaves v. State, 242 Ga. 542, 250 S.E.2d 376 (1978), overruled on other grounds, Felker v. State, 252 Ga. 351, 314 S.E.2d 621 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of speedy trial.</b> - In a habeas corpus hearing to avoid extradition, the question whether a petitioner was denied a speedy trial by the demanding state is not an appropriate one for adjudication by the asylum state.

<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Editor's notes.</b> - Ga. L. 1985, p. 420, effective March 27, 1985, repealed the Code sections formerly codified at this chapter and enacted the current chapter. The former chapter, which also dealt with treatment of youthful offenders, consisted of Code Sections 42-7-1 through 42-7-16. The former chapter also created the Youthful Offender Division of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (now Department of Corrections) and described that former division's powers and duties. While several provisions of Code sections of the former chapter were carried forward into the new chapter (see historical citations in this chapter), the following Acts formed the basis of Code sections which were not carried forward: Ga. L. 1972, p. 592, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14; Ga. L. 1975, p. 900, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2, 7; Ga. L. 1978, p. 922, <span class="s1">§</span> 1; Ga.

<p class="p4">Ga. L. 1985, p. 420, <span class="s1">§</span> 2, not codified by the General Assembly, provided that that Act would not operate to deny any rights to any youthful offender currently on probation pursuant to the "Georgia Youthful Offender Act of 1972," but any such person would remain on probation subject to any conditions as previously specified. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ga. L. 1998, p. 270, <span class="s1">§</span> 13, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly recognizes that criminal street gangs have succeeded at times in maintaining their structure, organization, and discipline in penal institutions and have continued to conduct criminal activities while incarcerated. Therefore, the General Assembly requests and encourages state and local officials with responsibility for the operation of adult and juvenile penal institutions and related facilities to develop policies and procedures which will identify members of criminal street gangs and, where necessary, to separate members and associates of the same criminal street gang in order that such gang members cannot maintain the gang's structure, organization, and discipline and will have a more difficult time in conducting criminal activities while incarcerated in this state."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Ch. 7, T. 42 contains significantly different provisions than the First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq.); specifically, the chapter does not authorize the discharge of a felony conviction and such conviction under the chapter may serve as a predicate for sentencing under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-7.

<p class="p11"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, opinions rendered under former Chapter 7 of this title, relating to the powers and duties of the former Youthful Offender Division of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (now Department of Corrections) are included in the opinions for this chapter. See the Editor's notes under the Chapter 7 heading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Classification as habitual offender for sentencing purposes.</b> - Inmate sentenced under Ga. L. 1972, p. 592, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see now O.C.G.A. ch. 7, T. 42) may also be classified as a habitual offender under Ga. L. 1980, p. 2002, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 for purposes of sentence computation. Further, in the rare case where a youthful offender is also classified as a habitual offender, earned-time adjustment for habitual offenders should be used in computing the offender's unconditional release date. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-62.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of revocation of offender's conditional release.</b> - When a youthful offender's conditional release is revoked, and the youth is not returned to the youthful offender program, the youth's status as a youthful offender is terminated and the youth's sentence should be computed on the basis of six years or the maximum term for the offense, if less than six years. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-127.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When a combination of youthful offender and standard sentences occur,</b> the Youthful Offender Division may not approve a conditional or unconditional release for the described youthful offender until the youth's concurrent standard sentence had expired; nevertheless, the youth could be assigned to an institution maintained primarily for youthful offenders during the entire period for which the board was charged with custody over the youth, since Ga. L. 1956, p. 161 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-5-50(b) and 42-5-51(b), (d)) empowered the board to assign inmates to any institution within its system, and further other statutory provisions authorized the director (now commissioner) of corrections to segregate youthful offenders from other prisoners. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-82.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Earning good-time credit.</b> - Youthful offenders can earn good-time credit toward the reduction of the youth's period of confinement to the extent provided in Ga.

However, under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2702 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34) a presentence report was also authorized before pronouncing sentence for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or part of the sentence to be imposed in a case.

<p class="p11"><b>2. Revealing Contents to Counsel</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge's discretion to reveal content of report to counsel.</b> - Since this section does not require the content of a presentence probation report to be shared with counsel, it is in the sound discretion of the trial judge whether to reveal the content of the report to counsel for the accused and for the state.

Ed. 2d 263 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disclosure of report containing adverse matters.</b> - When a presentence report contains any matter adverse to the defendant and likely to influence decision to suspend or probate the sentence, it should be revealed to defense counsel by the trial judge in advance of the presentence hearing to give the accused an opportunity for explanation or rebuttal. Dorsey v. Willis, 242 Ga. 316, 249 S.E.2d 28 (1978); Almon v. State, 151 Ga. App. 863, 261 S.E.2d 772 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 910, 100 S. Ct. 1839, 64 L.

<p class="p11"><b>3. Presentence and Post-sentence</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Utility of labeling report as post-sentence or presentence.</b> - Labeling an investigative report of the probation department as a "post-sentence" report, as distinguished from a "presentence" report, will not change the report's legal effect when the content, purpose, and function of the report are the same. Threatt v. State, 156 Ga. App. 345, 274 S.E.2d 734 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court may not do indirectly - with a "post-sentence"' report, that which Munsford v.

<p class="p4"><b>"Presentence" and "post-sentence" reports.</b> - There is no discernible difference between a "presentence" and "post-sentence" report, except as to time of submission, and this is of no import when each is used for the same purpose. Thus, it is permissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or some part of a sentence. For the same reason it is impermissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report in fixing the length of the sentence. Threatt v. State, 156 Ga. App. 345, 274 S.E.2d 734 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of "post-sentence" report to determine sentence.</b> - Since the trial court intended to use the "post-sentence" report to determine the final length of the sentence, it was implicit that the trial court imposed the original sentence with the intent of determining a final length of sentence only after viewing the "post-sentence" investigative report. In such instance, Munford v. State, 235 Ga. 38, 218 S.E.2d 792 (1975) and Mills v. State, 244 Ga. 186, 259 S.E.2d 445 (1979) proscribed the use of the reports to determine "length" of sentence without compliance with the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2503 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-2).

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p9">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any court of this state which has original jurisdiction of criminal actions, except municipal courts and probate courts, in which the defendant in a criminal case has been found guilty upon verdict or plea or has been sentenced upon a plea of nolo contendere, except for an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment, may, at a time to be determined by the court, hear and determine the question of the probation of such defendant. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prior to the sentencing hearing, the court may refer the case to an officer of the circuit in which the court is located for investigation and recommendation. The court, upon such reference, shall direct an officer to make an investigation and to report to the court, in writing at a specified time, upon the circumstances of the offense and the criminal record, social history, and present condition of the defendant, together with the officer's recommendation; and it shall be the duty of such officer to carry out the directive of the court. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of Code Section 17-10-1 and subsection (f) of Code Section 17-10-3, if it appears to the court upon a hearing of the matter that the defendant is not likely to engage in a criminal course of conduct and that the ends of justice and the welfare of society do not require that the defendant shall presently suffer the penalty imposed by law, the court in its discretion shall impose sentence upon the defendant but may stay and suspend the execution of the sentence or any portion thereof or may place him or her on probation under the supervision and control of the officer for the duration of the sentence. The period of probation or suspension shall not exceed the maximum sentence of confinement which could be imposed on the defendant. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(d) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In every case that a court of this state or any other state sentences a defendant to probation or any pretrial release or diversion program under the supervision of DCS, in addition to any fine or order of restitution imposed by the court, there shall be imposed a probation fee as a condition of probation, release, or diversion in the amount equivalent to $23.00 per each month under supervision, and in addition, a one-time fee of $50.00 if such defendant was convicted of any felony. The probation fee may be waived or amended after administrative process by DCS and approval of the court, or upon determination by the court, as to the undue hardship, inability to pay, or any other extenuating factors which prohibit collection of the fee; provided, however, that the imposition of sanctions for failure to pay fees shall be within the discretion of the court through judicial process or hearings. Probation fees shall be waived on probationers incarcerated or detained in a Department of Corrections or other confinement facility which prohibits employment for wages. All probation fees collected by DCS shall be paid into the general fund of the state treasury, except as provided in subsection (f) of Code Section 17-15-13, relating to sums to be paid into the Georgia Crime Victims Emergency Fund. Any fees collected by the court under this paragraph shall be remitted not later than the last day of the month after such fee is collected to the Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority for deposit into the general fund of the state treasury. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(2) In addition to any other provision of law, any person convicted of a violation of Code Section 40-6-391 or subsection (b) of Code Section 16-13-2 who is sentenced to probation or a suspended sentence by a municipal, magistrate, probate, recorder's, mayor's, state, or superior court shall also be required by the court to pay a one-time fee of $25.00. The clerk of court, or if there is no clerk the person designated to collect fines, fees, and forfeitures for such court, shall collect such fee and remit the same not later than the last day of the month after such fee is collected to the Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority for deposit into the general fund of the state treasury. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(3) In addition to any fine, fee, restitution, or other amount ordered, the sentencing court may also impose as a condition of probation for felony criminal defendants sentenced to a day reporting center an additional charge, not to exceed $10.00 per day for each day such defendant is required to report to a day reporting center; provided, however, that no fee shall be imposed or collected if the defendant is unemployed or has been found indigent by the sentencing court. The charges required by this paragraph shall be paid by the probationer directly to DCS. Funds collected by DCS pursuant to this subsection shall only be used by DCS in the maintenance and operation of the day reporting center program. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(e) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The court may, in its discretion, require the payment of a fine, fees, or restitution as a condition of probation. Chapter 14 of Title 17 shall control when determining the amount of restitution. When probation supervision is required, the court may require the payment of a probation supervision fee as a condition of probation. In determining the financial obligations, other than restitution, to impose on the defendant, the court may consider: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(A) The defendant's financial resources and other assets, including whether any such asset is jointly controlled; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p9">(C) The defendant's financial obligations, including obligations to dependents; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(D) The period of time during which the probation order will be in effect; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(E) The goal of the punishment being imposed; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(F) Any other factor the court deems appropriate. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(2) The court may convert fines, statutory surcharges, and probation supervision fees to community service or educational advancement on the same basis as it allows a defendant to pay a fine through community service or educational advancement as set forth in subsection (d) of Code Section 17-10-1. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(3) (A) As used in this subsection, the term: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(i) "Developmental disability" shall have the same meaning as set forth in Code Section 37-1-1. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(ii) "Indigent" means an individual who earns less than 100 percent of the federal poverty guidelines unless there is evidence that the individual has other resources that might reasonably be used without undue hardship for such individual or his or her dependents. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(iii) "Significant financial hardship" means a reasonable probability that an individual will be unable to satisfy his or her financial obligations for two or more consecutive months. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(iv) "Totally and permanently disabled" shall have the same meaning as set forth in Code Section 49-4-80. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(B) The court shall waive, modify, or convert fines, statutory surcharges, probation supervision fees, and any other moneys assessed by the court or a provider of probation services upon a determination by the court prior to or subsequent to sentencing that a defendant has a significant financial hardship or inability to pay or that there are any other extenuating factors which prohibit payment or collection; provided, however, that the imposition of sanctions for failure to pay such sums shall be within the discretion of the court through judicial process or hearings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(C) Unless rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant will be able to satisfy his or her financial obligations without undue hardship to the defendant or his or her dependents, a defendant shall be presumed to have a significant financial hardship if he or she: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(i) Has a developmental disability; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(ii) Is totally and permanently disabled; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(iii) Is indigent; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(iv) Has been released from confinement within the preceding 12 months and was incarcerated for more than 30 days before his or her release. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the interval between the conviction or plea and the hearing to determine the question of probation, the court may, in its discretion, either order the confinement of the defendant without bond or may permit his or her release on bond, which bond shall be conditioned on his appearance at the hearing and shall be subject to the same rules as govern appearance bonds. Any time served in confinement shall be considered a part of the sentence of the defendant. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(g)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sentencing judge shall not lose jurisdiction over any person placed on probation during the term of the person's probated sentence. The judge is empowered to revoke any or all of the probated sentence, rescind any or all of the sentence, or, in any manner deemed advisable by the judge, modify or change the probated sentence, including ordering the probationer into the sentencing options system, as provided in Article 6 of Chapter 3 of this title, at any time during the period of time prescribed for the probated sentence to run. In addition, when the judge is considering revoking a probated sentence in order to require the defendant to enter a drug court division, mental health court division, family treatment court division, or veterans court division and the length of the original sentence is insufficient to authorize such revocation, the defendant may voluntarily agree to an extension of his or her original sentence within the maximum sentence allowed by law, notwithstanding subsection (f) of Code Section 17-10-1. Such extension shall be for a period not to exceed three years, and upon completion of such specific court division program, the court may modify the terms of probation in accordance with subparagraph (a)(5)(A) of Code Section 17-10-1. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(h)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a defendant is placed on probation in a county of a judicial circuit other than the one in which such defendant resides for committing any misdemeanor offense, such defendant may, when specifically ordered by the court, have probation supervision transferred to the judicial circuit of the county in which the defendant resides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stage of proceedings to determine probation.</b> - Language of this section seems to refer to probation as a part of the original sentence, and the provision for a hearing must, considering the language as a whole, refer to a hearing on the type of sentence to be imposed, and not authorize the court, at a subsequent term, to add to the sentence a provision for probation when the court made no provision relating thereto in the first instance.

<p class="p4"><b>Consideration of conduct prior to sentencing.</b> - Trial court did not err in considering information as to an altercation between the defendant and a deputy sheriff taking the defendant to the defendant's cell during the trial prior to sentencing when the sentence was already set and the information complained of was considered by the trial court merely to determine what portions would be served on probation or incarceration.

<p class="p4"><b>Referral of case to probation officer not jurisdictional.</b> - Court sentencing the defendant has jurisdiction of the probation features of the case and may refer the case to a circuit probation officer (now probation supervisor) for investigation and recommendation prior to hearing, but the fact that the court has placed the defendant on probation without such referral does not mean either that the court is without jurisdiction to revoke the probation, or that the statutory provisions do not apply.

Although authorized for consideration on the question of probation, in practice such reports may be considered by the trial judge in reducing the length of the sentence. Bentley v.

<p class="p4"><b>Use of previously undisclosed report.</b> - Although use of a previously undisclosed probation report to aid the trial judge in determining whether to suspend or probate a sentence does not invalidate the sentence which is imposed, the report cannot be used in fixing the length of the sentence. McDuffie v. Jones, 248 Ga. 544, 283 S.E.2d 601 (1981), overruled on other grounds, West v. Waters, 272 Ga. 591, 533 S.E.2d 88 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

However, under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2702 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34) a presentence report was also authorized before pronouncing sentence for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or part of the sentence to be imposed in a case.

<p class="p11"><b>3. Disclosure of Contents to Counsel</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge's discretion to reveal content of report to counsel.</b> - Since this section does not require the content of a presentence probation report to be shared with counsel, it is in the sound discretion of the trial judge whether to reveal the content of the report to counsel for the accused and for the state. Munsford v. State, 235 Ga. 38, 218 S.E.2d 792 (1975); Benefield v. State, 140 Ga. App. 727, 232 S.E.2d 89 (1976); Watts v. State, 141 Ga. App. 127, 232 S.E.2d 590, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 925, 98 S.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disclosure of presentence report containing adverse matters.</b> - If a presentence probation officer's report contains any matter adverse to the defendant and likely to influence the decision to suspend or probate the sentence, it should be revealed to defense counsel by the trial judge in advance of the presentence hearing to give the accused an opportunity for explanation or rebuttal. Munsford v. State, 235 Ga. 38, 218 S.E.2d 792 (1975); Benefield v. State, 140 Ga. App. 727, 232 S.E.2d 89 (1976); Dorsey v. Willis, 242 Ga. 316, 249 S.E.2d 28 (1978); Almon v. State, 151 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notification by court of intent to use matters in aggravation.</b> - When the trial court intends to consider matters in aggravation that were ruled inadmissible during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial, the court must inform defense counsel and the prosecution of the court's plans in this regard before the presentence hearing. Absent such notice from the trial court judge, the defense and the prosecution cannot adequately prepare their cases or summon their witnesses for the presentence hearing. Dorsey v.

<p class="p11"><b>4. Presentence and Post-sentence</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of labeling report as post-sentence or presentence.</b> - Labeling an investigative report of the probation department as a "post-sentence" report, as contra-distinguished from a "presentence" report, will not change the report's legal effect where the content, the purpose, and function of the report are the same. Threatt v. State, 156 Ga. App. 345, 274 S.E.2d 734 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court may not do indirectly - with a "post-sentence" report, that which Munsford v. State, 235 Ga. 38, 218 S.E.2d 792 (1975) proscribes directly - using a "presentence" report to determine the length of sentence. Threatt v. State, 156 Ga. App. 345, 274 S.E.2d 734 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Utilizing later report to determine final length of sentence.</b> - Trial court erred in imposing the maximum sentence with the intent of utilizing a later report to determine the final length of sentence. Threatt v. State, 156 Ga. App. 345, 274 S.E.2d 734 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Difference between "presentence" and "post-sentence" reports.</b> - Because there is no discernible difference between a "presentence" and "post-sentence" report, except as to time of submission, this is of no import when each is used for the same purpose. Thus, it is permissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or some part of a sentence. For the same reason it is impermissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report in fixing the length of the sentence. Threatt v. State, 156 Ga. App. 345, 274 S.E.2d 734 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the trial court intended to use the "post-sentence" report to determine the final length of the sentence, it was implicit that the trial court imposed the original sentence with the intent of determining a final length of sentence only after viewing the "post-sentence" investigative report. In such instance, Munford v. State, 235 Ga. 38, 218 S.E.2d 792 (1975) and Mills v. State, 244 Ga. 186, 259 S.E.2d 445 (1979), proscribe the use of the reports to determine "length" of sentence without compliance with the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2503 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-2).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ability of defendant to pay fine.</b> - Because the ability of a defendant to pay a fine is often a factor for the sentencing judge to consider in assessing the likelihood that the defendant will serve a term of probation without violation, a conditionally probated sentence is not necessarily invidious discrimination based on wealth if the sentencing judge has determined that the defendant would not be a good candidate for probation unless a fine is paid first. Hunter v. Dean, 240 Ga. 214, 239 S.E.2d 791 (1977), cert. dismissed, 439 U.S. 281, 99 S. Ct. 712, 58 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1978), overruled on other grounds, Massey v.

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant must be aware of condition precedent.</b> - While a court may lawfully require the payment of a fine as a condition precedent to being allowed to begin a probationary period, due process demands that the defendant be made aware that such condition is in fact a condition precedent.

<p class="p4"><b>Probated confinement held excessive.</b> - After a repeat offender was convicted on two counts of misdemeanor theft, and the trial court imposed probated confinement for a period of five years when the maximum period of confinement which could be imposed was for a term of one year, this error was not harmless as both sentences ran consecutively and one of the conditions of the probation was, that in the event probation was revoked, the trial court could order the execution of the sentence originally imposed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused.</b> - Trial court's attempt to revoke part of the defendant's probated sentence for theft was a nullity because, although an earlier court order was ambiguous about whether or not the probation provisions for both offenses had been revoked, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused. Merneigh v. State, 271 Ga. 883, 525 S.E.2d 362 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice and hearing prior to revocation of suspended sentence.</b> - Sentence which is suspended cannot be revoked as to the suspension feature without notice and opportunity to be heard. This is true as the modification may be made only after hearing and a finding by the court that the defendant has failed to comply with the terms under which the sentence was suspended. Entrekin v.

<p class="p4"><b>Trial court did not err in modifying the probationary portion of the defendant's sentence by imposing a condition banishing defendant</b> from the subdivision in which the defendant committed burglaries because the trial court's original sentencing order included as a special condition of probation that the defendant was to avoid all contact with the burglary victims, each of whom lived in the subdivision at issue, and to the extent that the modified sentence simply clarified the scope of that special condition, it was contemplated within the terms of the original sentence pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34(g); the banishment provision was reasonable, narrow in scope, and included only the subdivision in which the victims resided, and in the absence of a hearing transcript or any record evidence to the contrary, the court of appeals had to presume that the trial court properly considered the evidence before it.

<p class="p4"><b>Registration for public indecency proper as part of probation.</b> - Because the defendant's sex offender registration as part of probation was limited to the maximum sentence allowed by law as punishment for that crime, the trial court did not improperly give the defendant an indeterminate sentence by requiring the defendant to register as a sexual offender following the defendant's conviction for felony public indecency. Loya v. State, 321 Ga. App. 430, 740 S.E.2d 382 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Further, because the trial court, when pronouncing the defendant's first offender sentence, advised the defendant that, upon adjudication of guilt, the defendant could be resentenced to the statutory maximum for two counts of child molestation, and that the time served would be credited against the defendant's new sentence, the trial court was authorized to increase the sentence originally imposed.

<p class="p4"><b>Retention for entire term of probation.</b> - Sentencing judge retains jurisdiction over the probated person during the entire term of such probated sentence, but cannot revoke any sentence which has expired at the time the revocation proceedings are had, nor revoke any future sentence which has not begun to run at the time of such revocation proceedings. Todd v. State, 108 Ga. App. 615, 134 S.E.2d 56 (1963). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-29 did not violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers, as a probation supervisor had a duty to make the supervisor's findings and report regarding an alleged probation revocation in writing to the court with the supervisor's recommendation; not unlike a district attorney, the probation supervisor was an employee of the Department of Corrections, within the executive branch of state government, and was charged with providing the trial court with information relevant to pending criminal proceedings over which the court alone exercised judicial authority.

<p class="p4">Order modifying the trial court's prior banishment order imposed as a condition of the defendant's probation was upheld on appeal, as was the denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw a negotiated plea because: (1) the defendant's sentence was independent, and thus, not part of the negotiated plea agreement; and (2) the trial court adequately considered that the defendant's crimes were likely motivated by the relationship the defendant had with the victim, the defendant's ex-spouse, where the ex-spouse resided and worked, as well as where the ex-spouse's immediate family lived, by determining that the banishment order was issued to protect those affected, but also served a rehabilitative purpose by removing a temptation by the defendant to re-offend.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in modifying the probationary portion of the defendant's sentence because the court retained jurisdiction to modify the terms of the defendant's probation; although the trial court's order modifying the defendant's probated sentence was not entered until the subsequent term of court, the state filed its motion to modify the sentence within the same term in which the sentence was originally rendered.

<p class="p4"><b>Requiring showing of child support payments did not constitute an illegal increase in sentence.</b> - Defendant who complained that the defendant was unable to pay restitution because the defendant was also paying child support was ordered, as a condition of probation, to provide proof of the child support payments that the defendant made. Given that this condition did not increase the amount the defendant was obligated to pay as part of the defendant's sentence, the condition did not constitute an illegal increase in that sentence under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34(g). Polly v. State, 323 Ga. App. 893, 748 S.E.2d 696 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to vacate the defendant's sentence because the probation modification did not constitute punishment since the trial court retained jurisdiction to modify or change the probated sentence and changing the no violent contact order to no contact was not punishment but, rather, was for the purpose of protecting the victim.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Availability of habeas relief to probationer.</b> - While a sentencing court retains jurisdiction over a defendant during any period of probation and may modify or correct the probated sentence as necessary, a writ of habeas corpus is an available avenue of relief in cases wherein a defendant not only seeks a modification of the conditions of the probation but also asserts that the sentence imposed was unconstitutional. To the extent that Dean v. Whalen, 234 Ga. 182 (1975), holds to the contrary, it is overruled. Terry v. Hamrick, 284 Ga. 24, 663 S.E.2d 256 (2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 510, 172 L.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of other law.</b> - There was no modification of the defendant's probation when an original condition of probation was that the defendant make regular reports to the defendant's probation officer as directed and when that condition was later clarified to require that the defendant submit out-of-state travel plans to the defendant's probation officer so that the probation department could comply with an interstate compact relating to interstate travel of sex offenders.

<p class="p4"><b>Amending or revoking sentence before commencement of sentence.</b> - Trial court has no power to amend and modify a sentence in a criminal case after the term during which the sentence was imposed; accordingly, if the defendant had been sentenced to an indeterminate term in the penitentiary without any provision for probation, the court properly refused to entertain a motion made at a subsequent term that the sentence be modified so as to allow the defendant to serve the sentence on probation. Phillips v. State, 95 Ga. App. 277, 97 S.E.2d 707 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court has no power to amend a sentence or revoke the sentence's probationary or suspended feature before the term of sentence has commenced to run, except in the case of the exercise of the plenary power of the court to amend, modify, or rescind judgments during the term of court in which the sentences are entered; and it is error to order the revocation of such sentence, the term of which is not in effect at the time of the purported revocation.

<p class="p4"><b>Amending sentence during same court term by shortening imprisonment.</b> - Power of a superior court in a criminal case to amend a sentence during the same term of the court in which the sentence was imposed, by shortening the period of imprisonment, is not lost by entry of the defendant upon the service of such sentence. When, by an amendment so made during the same term, the period of service in the penitentiary, as fixed in a sentence for a reducible felony, is changed to a shorter term in the county correctional institution as for a misdemeanor, the amendment may also provide for service of the misdemeanor sentence, or any remainder thereof, on probation.

<p class="p9">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the purposes of this Code section, the term "special condition of probation or suspension of the sentence" means a condition of a probated or suspended sentence which: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(1) Is expressly imposed as part of the sentence in addition to general conditions of probation and court ordered fines and fees; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(2) Is identified in writing in the sentence as a condition the violation of which authorizes the court to revoke the probation or suspension and require the defendant to serve up to the balance of the sentence in confinement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A court may not revoke any part of any probated or suspended sentence unless the defendant admits the violation as alleged or unless the evidence produced at the revocation hearing establishes by a preponderance of the evidence the violation or violations alleged. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At any revocation hearing, upon proof that the defendant has violated any general provision of probation or suspension other than by commission of a new felony offense, the court shall consider the use of alternatives to include community service, probation detention centers, special alternative incarceration, or any other alternative to confinement deemed appropriate by the court or as provided by the state or county. In the event the court determines that the defendant does not meet the criteria for such alternatives, the court may revoke the balance of probation or not more than two years in confinement, whichever is less. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the violation of probation or suspension alleged and proven by a preponderance of the evidence or the defendant's admission is the commission of a felony offense, the court may revoke no more than the lesser of the balance of probation or the maximum time of the sentence authorized to be imposed for the felony offense constituting the violation of the probation. For purposes of this Code section, the term "felony offense" means: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(1) A felony offense; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(2) A misdemeanor offense committed in another state on or after July 1, 2010, the elements of which are proven by a preponderance of evidence showing that such offense would constitute a felony if the act had been committed in this state; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(3) A misdemeanor offense committed in another state on or after July 1, 2010, that is admitted to by the defendant who also admits that such offense would be a felony if the act had been committed in this state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the violation of probation or suspension alleged and proven by a preponderance of the evidence or the defendant's admission is the violation of a special condition of probation or suspension of the sentence, the court may revoke the probation or suspension of the sentence and require the defendant to serve the balance or portion of the balance of the original sentence in confinement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The payment of restitution or reparation, costs, or fines ordered by the court may be payable in one lump sum or in periodic payments, as determined by the court after consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case and of the defendant's ability to pay. Such payments shall, in the discretion of the sentencing judge, be made either to the clerk of the sentencing court or, if the sentencing court is a probate court, state court, or superior court, to the DCS office serving such court. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(g)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In no event shall an offender be supervised on probation for more than a total of two years for any one offense or series of offenses arising out of the same transaction, whether before or after confinement, except as provided by paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of Code Section 17-10-1 and subsection (g) of Code Section 42-8-34.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Considerations</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fourth Amendment not violated.</b> - Police were not acting in bad faith or in an arbitrary and capricious manner when the police searched the defendant's home since the defendant waived Fourth Amendment rights for probation and the police had a reasonable suspicion that there were drugs present. Reece v. State, 257 Ga. App. 137, 570 S.E.2d 424 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition should be in writing.</b> - Although a condition of probation that the defendant not cohabit with a person of the opposite sex was not in writing and may not have even applied, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(a)(2), defendant's challenge to the condition after probation had already been served was moot. Jayko v. State, 335 Ga. App. 684, 782 S.E.2d 788 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to warn of consequences for violations.</b> - Sentencing court's failure to warn a defendant, in writing, as to the consequences of violating the terms of probation was not substantial compliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(a)(2). Harvey v. Meadows, 280 Ga. 166, 626 S.E.2d 92 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the relevant sentencing documents failed to state that a probationer's failure to complete a diversion center program would result in the court revoking probation and requiring the probationer to serve the balance of the original sentence in prison, and the original sentencing form did not comply with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1, the trial court erred in revoking the remainder of the probationer's probation term; moreover, despite the state's contention that the probationer waived any issue regarding the wording of the sentence by consenting to the consent order, there was no basis found in the record for the appeals court to find such. Gamble v. State, 290 Ga. App. 37, 658 S.E.2d 785 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1 because the original sentencing form did not adequately warn the defendant in writing of the consequences of violating a special condition; thus, the defendant was entitled to resentencing. Sheppard v. State, 319 Ga. App. 813, 738 S.E.2d 662 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Amended statute governed revocation.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1 governs the requirements for revocation of a probated sentence, and specifically repealed, without a savings clause, the prior statutory provision and all conflicting laws; the amended provision precluded the trial court from considering the prior, unamended statute during a revocation hearing as the court was bound by the revocation requirements in effect at the time defendant's probation was revoked, not at the time the defendant was sentenced to probation. Gardner v. State, 259 Ga. App. 375, 577 S.E.2d 69 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly revoked a probationer's term of probation, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1 as amended, requiring the probationer to serve the full balance of the remaining sentence as the probationer failed to report to a probation supervisor as directed in the probation order and any violation of the special conditions could result in the revocation of the entire balance of probation and require the probationer to serve up to the balance of the sentence in confinement. Hill v. State, 270 Ga. App. 114, 605 S.E.2d 831 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation not established by preponderance of evidence.</b> - Revocation of probation based on a child molestation charge was error because competent evidence showed that the defendant's brother saw the defendant, fully clothed, asleep on the sofa with a fully clothed child in the defendant's lap, and did not see them doing anything wrong. Hunt v. State, 327 Ga. App. 692, 761 S.E.2d 99 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence required for revocation of probation.</b> - Habeas court utilized the incorrect standard as a conviction was not necessary for a revocation of more than two years of probation; all that was required by former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(d) was that the felony upon which the revocation of probation was based be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, or by the defendant's admission of the felony's commission. Lewis v. Sims, 277 Ga. 240, 587 S.E.2d 646 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hearsay evidence insufficient for probation revocation.</b> - Trial court abused its discretion in revoking the defendant's probation based upon incompetent and insufficient evidence; the only evidence that a crime was committed was an officer's hearsay testimony that the officer was told that an air compressor was stolen and that testimony was offered only to show the officer's reasons for conducting an investigation. Smith v. State, 283 Ga. App. 317, 641 S.E.2d 296 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation based on misdemeanor.</b> - Because the revocation petition did not specify which Code section the defendant was alleged to have violated for the drug-related objects offense and instead simply accused the defendant of possessing certain specified drug-related objects, the only violation alleged and proven fell under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-13-32.2, a misdemeanor; therefore, the trial court was not authorized to revoke more than two years of the defendant's outstanding probation. Henley v. State, 317 Ga. App. 776, 732 S.E.2d 836 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Resentencing on revocation of probation was necessary as the trial court could not revoke more than two years of probation based on the remaining technical violations for failure to pay court-ordered monies. Hunt v. State, 327 Ga. App. 692, 761 S.E.2d 99 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probation revocation's two-year limitation.</b> - When, after the defendant's probation revocation hearing, the trial court ordered the defendant to serve six months in jail for each of the seven probation violations found to total three and one-half years, that order violated the plain words of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1, limiting confinement for probation revocation to no more than two years. Cockrell v. Brown, 263 Ga. 345, 433 S.E.2d 585 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Revocation of the balance of four and one-half years of the defendant's probation based on the commission of two new violent misdemeanors was error because, when the sole basis for revoking probation is the commission of a new misdemeanor, whether violent or not, the cap is two years. Lawrence v. State, 228 Ga. App. 745, 492 S.E.2d 727 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(c) placed a two-year limitation on the period of confinement which may be ordered when probation was revoked because of a violation of a general provision of probation; a trial court's revocation order, which could possibly have been construed as ordering more than two years in confinement, was improper. Jordan v. State, 279 Ga. App. 399, 635 S.E.2d 163 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probation conditions violated by a defendant were not special conditions under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1 because the conditions were not imposed in addition to general conditions and court-ordered fines and fees; thus, the trial court was not authorized to revoke the balance of the defendant's probation and to require the defendant to serve more than two years in confinement. Chester v. State, 287 Ga. App. 70, 651 S.E.2d 360 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When nothing in the record showed that the trial court considered alternatives to confinement, the court erred in ordering a defendant who had violated probation to serve more than two years in confinement. Chester v. State, 287 Ga. App. 70, 651 S.E.2d 360 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Two-year limitation did not apply.</b> - Trial court did not err in revoking defendant's probation and requiring defendant to serve five years in a probation detention center as the use of the probation detention center was an appropriate alternative; pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(c), the two-year maximum for confinement in jail did not apply. Syms v. State, 257 Ga. App. 521, 571 S.E.2d 514 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court erred in ordering a probationer to serve three years</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>because the sentence was a term of confinement greater than that specified in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(c). Klicka v. State, 315 Ga. App. 635, 727 S.E.2d 248 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limits on years of probation revoked.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(d) and (e), violation of a special condition of probation can result in revocation of more than two years of probation; violation of a general condition of probation authorizes the revocation of no more than two years of probation. Gardner v. State, 259 Ga. App. 375, 577 S.E.2d 69 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Resentencing was necessary because the trial court was authorized to revoke no more of the defendant's probation than the maximum time authorized for the defendant's violation of the North Carolina statute the defendant violated. Beavers v. State, 346 Ga. App. 373, 816 S.E.2d 384 (2018). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(d), a trial court was authorized to revoke no more than the lesser of the balance of probation or the maximum time of sentence authorized for the crime constituting a violation of the defendant's probation; since the maximum sentence for the crime constituting a violation of the defendant's probation, felony obstruction, was five years, the trial court erred in revoking over eight years of probation. Gibson v. State, 279 Ga. App. 838, 632 S.E.2d 740 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly revoked the defendant's probation as a result of finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant engaged in a conspiracy to commit a forgery by buying a roll of holograph-imprinted laminate from an inmate to make fraudulent driver's licenses; but the trial court erred in revoking seven instead of just five years of the defendant's probation because, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(d), the maximum sentence authorized was the lesser of the balance of probation or the maximum time of the sentence authorized to be imposed for the crime constituting the violation of the probation. Since conspiracy to commit first degree forgery was punishable by no more than five years imprisonment, and the defendant had seven years of probation left, only five years should have been revoked. Walker v. State, 289 Ga. App. 879, 658 S.E.2d 375 (2008), overruled on other grounds, Gordon v. State, 334 Ga. App. 633, 780 S.E.2d 376 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden is on the state to prove a violation of probation</b> by a preponderance of the evidence. Farmer v. State, 216 Ga. App. 515, 455 S.E.2d 297 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of change in quantum of proof.</b> - That the quantum of proof necessary to revoke probation has been changed from "slight evidence" to "a preponderance of the evidence" does not affect the rule that a ruling in favor of the probationer, continuing rather than revoking probation, has no collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent criminal trial. State v. Jones, 196 Ga. App. 896, 397 S.E.2d 209 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure of state to prove reliability of drug test.</b> - Revocation of probation based on defendant's failure of a drug test was error since the test result lacked probative value and no expert testimony was offered by the state to prove the scientific reliability of the ontrack system as used for the purpose of drug detection.

<p class="p4">On appeal from an order revoking a probationer's probation, the trial court erred by admitting the results of a Roche "OnTrack TesTstik" without a showing that the test had reached a scientific state of verifiable certainty, which would allow admission of the test's results in the absence of expert testimony; on remand, the court was directed to determine whether the court would have revoked the balance of the probation term based upon the probationer's failure to comply with the special condition of restitution standing alone, or impose a lesser penalty instead.

<p class="p4"><b>Ex post facto inquiry.</b> - To determine if an ex post facto violation resulted from use of the applied law in a probation revocation matter, the law in effect at the time of the probation revocation must be measured against the law in effect at the time of the initial offense, not the law in effect at the time of the act that resulted in probation revocation.

<p class="p4"><b>No separation of powers violation.</b> - Trial court's order revoking a probationer's probation did not violate the separation of powers doctrine under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Para. III, as the probationer's release resulted from an administrative error, and there was no evidence of any executive department finding that the probationer had fully served an imposed sentence in confinement based on a good-time allowance or otherwise.

<p class="p4"><b>No due process violation.</b> - Notice given to a defendant that the defendant violated probation by committing robbery was sufficient notice that the defendant violated probation by committing the lesser included offense of theft by taking based on the same facts; under these circumstances, the defendant could not reasonably contend for due process purposes that the defendant was not aware of the grounds on which revocation was sought or that the defendant's ability to prepare a defense was compromised.

<p class="p4"><b>Probation revocation did not increase sentence.</b> - As plaintiff had already served two years of plaintiff's probation, the motion to amend the probated sentence, which admittedly had a clerical error, prepared by defendant probation officer did not serve as an amendment to the length of the sentence imposed on the plaintiff. The grant of the order had the effect of revoking the probation provisions contained in the original sentence and requiring that the remainder of the sentence be served in confinement, but it could not, and did not, increase the length of the sentence.

<p class="p4"><b>Testimony from spouse during probation revocation hearing.</b> - Two years of a probated sentence were properly revoked because the trial court did not err in allowing a probationer's spouse to testify without informing the spouse of the marital privilege pursuant to former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 24-9-21 and 24-9-23 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 24-5-501 and 24-5-503) because the spouse was aware of the privilege but never asserted the privilege to the trial court, and it was assumed that the spouse waived the right not to testify.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remand for clarification of probation revocation.</b> - In an action to revoke probation, remand was necessary because the written revocation orders stated that the trial court found that the defendant violated the conditions of probation by an unauthorized change of residence and failure to report to the defendant's probation officer as directed, reasons not charged in the state's petition and the appellate court could not ascertain the true basis for the revocation.

<p class="p4"><b>Revocation was proper but credit for time served was still due to defendant.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by revoking the defendant's probation because the ambiguity in the form of the sentencing document was not fatal to the court's revocation since the defendant violated a rule prescribed by the court in failing to complete the drug treatment program the defendant had already begun; however, the trial court erred by failing to credit the defendant for 14 days for time served as outlined in the defendant's sentence when the court revoked the defendant's probation.

<p class="p4"><b>Impossibility for completion of special probationary condition.</b> - Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probationary sentence because insufficient evidence supported the court's finding that the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation by failing to attend a domestic violence intervention program; the sentence did not require the defendant to complete the domestic violence intervention program by any specific date, and no evidence was presented that it was even possible for the defendant to have completed such a program during the approximately three months that the defendant served on probation prior to being arrested for violating the terms of the defendant's probationary sentence.

<p class="p4"><b>No date for completion of community service.</b> - Insufficient evidence supported the trial court's findings that the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation by failing to complete any of the defendant's community service requirement because no evidence was presented that the defendant was ever directed to begin the defendant's community service on any specific date or at all.

<p class="p4"><b>Violation of special condition.</b> - When the violation of probation results solely from infraction of a special condition, not from commission of a felony offense, the revocation court is authorized by subsection (c) to revoke no more than the balance of defendant's probation. Gearinger v. Lee, 266 Ga. 167, 465 S.E.2d 440 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court's reliance on O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(c) to revoke four years of defendant's probation was appropriate; violation of any new special condition imposed in a previous revocation proceeding or any original condition reimposed therein was deemed to be a violation of a special condition imposed pursuant to the statute. Bryant v. State, 251 Ga. App. 108, 553 S.E.2d 629 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(c) authorizes the revocation of the entirety of a probated sentence in those limited instances when the probationer has a prior revocation based on the violation of a special condition or when the special condition violated by the probationer consists of the failure to make court-ordered payments of restitution, reparation, costs, or fines. Chatman v. Findley, 274 Ga. 54, 548 S.E.2d 5 (2001), superseded by statute as stated in Williams v. Ayers, 276 Ga. 130, 577 S.E.2d 767 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1, a probated sentence cannot be revoked for more than two years unless the basis for revocation is either a new felony offense or a violation of a special condition of probation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Special condition of probation means a condition of a probated or suspended sentence which: (1) is expressly imposed as part of the sentence in addition to general conditions of probation and court ordered fines and fees; and (2) is identified in writing in the sentence as a condition the violation of which authorizes the court to revoke the probation or suspension and requires the defendant to serve up to the balance of the sentence in confinement. Gardner v. State, 259 Ga. App. 375, 577 S.E.2d 69 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's original sentence for child molestation contained a virtually verbatim reproduction of the language required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1 to create a special condition of probation (that the defendant not associate with minors), and a modification order entered after the defendant's first probation violation did not suggest that the warnings contained in the original sentence were no longer applicable. Therefore, when the defendant violated the special condition of probation a second time, the sentencing court was justified under <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1 in requiring the defendant to serve the balance of the sentence in prison. Jowers v. Washington, 284 Ga. 478, 668 S.E.2d 703 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in revoking probated sentence because the evidence was sufficient to convict the probationer of making a terroristic threat pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-11-37(a) in violation of the probationer's probation, and it was more than sufficient to justify the revocation of a portion of the probationer's probated sentence; the probationer's statement that he would shoot his wife in the head with his pistol would be sufficient to show that the probationer threatened his wife with a crime of violence with the purpose of terrorizing her, and the wife's testimony was corroborated despite the fact that she was the only one who heard the threats and despite the fact that she minimized their significance in her testimony. Geter v. State, 300 Ga. App. 396, 685 S.E.2d 342 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant admitted that the defendant failed to make the required restitution payments, which were made a special condition of the defendant's probation, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in revoking the entire balance of the defendant's probation pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(e).

<p class="p4"><b>Commission of crime while on probation.</b> - At the revocation hearing, the trial court expressly found that the defendant violated probation because the defendant committed the offense of cruelty to children, which was one of the grounds for revocation alleged in the petition, and the transcript of that hearing was a sufficient written record for the appellate court to determine the ground upon which the trial court revoked the defendant's probation.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in revoking the defendant's probation upon concluding the defendant did not rebut the presumption of ownership as the evidence of possession included not only the defendant's status as the driver, but also suspicious movements, driving away at low speed after being pulled over and before the officer's approach to the truck, the unanimous disclaimer of ownership (contradicted after arrest), and the defendant's statements immediately after arrest. Reeves v. State, 353 Ga. App. 347, 836 S.E.2d 838 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Drug use while on probation.</b> - Evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation because at the probation revocation hearing, the defendant admitted that the defendant smoked marijuana while on probation and that the defendant failed to pay the fines associated with the original conviction for the sale of cocaine. Simpson v. State, 252 Ga. App. 1, 555 S.E.2d 247 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence was sufficient to support revocation of the second defendant's probation as the state only had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the second defendant violated the terms of the second defendant's probation and the state proved that by showing that the second defendant possessed cocaine and by showing that the second defendant associated with disreputable characters, which it proved by establishing that the second defendant admitted the second defendant had associated with the first defendant. Dugger v. State, 260 Ga. App. 843, 581 S.E.2d 655 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the trial court did not err in: (1) admitting evidence of field tests done on the suspected methamphetamine found in a probationer's residence; (2) holding that the methamphetamine residue in a tin found in the probationer's dresser drawer supported a conclusion that the probationer's possession of the methamphetamine amounted to a violation of probation; and (3) admitting evidence showing the basis of the arrest warrant, despite a claim that the probationer was found to have not participated in a conspiracy to traffic methamphetamine, an order revoking the probationer's probation term was upheld. Giang v. State, 285 Ga. App. 491, 646 S.E.2d 710 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in revoking probation on the ground that the probationer committed the felony offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute because it was within the court's discretion to find that a sufficient foundation had been laid to allow an officer to state the officer's opinion that the substance found in the car in which the probationer was riding was cocaine when the officer testified that the officer had been a member of the narcotics investigation unit for five years, that the officer had received training in the visual identification of cocaine, and that the officer had personally worked over 200 cases where the officer had seized suspected cocaine, which subsequently tested positive for cocaine; the trial court did not manifestly abuse the court's discretion when the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the substance was cocaine and that the probationer had constructive possession of the cocaine because in addition to the officer's opinion on the identity of the substance, the record contained other circumstantial evidence indicating that the substance was cocaine, and the driver of the car denied that the cocaine was the driver's and stated that the cocaine was thrown to the floorboard under the driver's feet by the probationer.

<p class="p4">Defendant's application for discretionary appeal was improvidently granted and the defendant's appeal was dismissed because, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(b), the evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation when marijuana and an open container of alcohol were found on the floorboard of a vehicle at the defendant's feet, and the defendant resisted arrest. Killian v. State, 315 Ga. App. 731, 728 S.E.2d 258 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to pay restitution as probation violation.</b> - Evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's decision to revoke the defendant's probation as a preponderance of the evidence showed that the defendant was in violation of the defendant's restitution obligation since the defendant admitted that the defendant was in arrears on that obligation, and that the defendant committed a second violation of the defendant's probation by committing criminal acts on another person after the victim testified that the defendant struck the victim in the head and was among a group of men who beat and robbed the victim. Cannon v. State, 260 Ga. App. 15, 579 S.E.2d 60 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court may revoke a probated sentence when the preponderance of the evidence shows that the defendant has committed the alleged violation of probation pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(a); thus, since the defendant's voluntary handwriting sample was properly admitted, the trial court did not consider an unreliable photo identification, and an expert was properly qualified, the evidence was sufficient to revoke the defendant's probation. Poole v. State, 270 Ga. App. 432, 606 S.E.2d 878 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Variance between dates in revocation petition and actual date.</b> - Inadequacy of a probation revocation petition was not necessarily a basis for setting aside a revocation order if the factual grounds were established at the hearing; thus, a one-month variance between the date alleged in the petition and that proved at the hearing was not fatal. Wolcott v. State, 278 Ga. 664, 604 S.E.2d 478 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of probation for criminal trespass and loitering.</b> - Trial court was authorized to find, under the preponderance of the evidence standard, that the defendant's presence on private property caused a justifiable and reasonable alarm for the safety of the property, and the revocation of the defendant's probation was proper for the offense of criminal trespass and loitering or prowling when the record showed that the defendant climbed through a hole in a fence around private property at a time when the business was closed and the gate shut, where a manager called police, and where, when the defendant was told that police had been summoned, the defendant left the scene; there was no evidence that the defendant's economic status or homelessness factored into the trial court's decision to revoke defendant's probation. Milanovich v. State, 278 Ga. App. 669, 629 S.E.2d 556 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession of firearm by probationer.</b> - Because the evidence showed that the probationer had continuous access to the firearms in the house on the day of a fatal shooting, and that the probationer intended to, and did in fact exercise control over the sons' access to one of the guns in the minutes leading up to the shooting, the trial court properly found that the probationer had constructive possession of the firearm. Wright v. State, 279 Ga. App. 299, 630 S.E.2d 774 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There was sufficient evidence to support the revocation of the defendant's probation as the evidence gave rise to a presumption of the defendant's constructive possession of the shotgun found in the closet of the master bedroom of the defendant's residence and there was no evidence others had equal access to the residence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Obstruction of officer by probationer.</b> - Although the evidence that the probationer made the probationer's arrest warrant unavailable to the officers was circumstantial, it was sufficient to authorize the trial court's finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the probationer obstructed the officers. Carlson v. State, 280 Ga. App. 595, 634 S.E.2d 410 (2006), cert. denied, No. S06C2099, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 215 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cruelty to own child sufficient for probation revocation.</b> - Defendant's probation was properly revoked as the defendant committed the offense of cruelty to children by maliciously causing the defendant's own daughter cruel or excessive physical or mental pain because the evidence showed that, when the defendant's daughter was four and five years old, the defendant frequently disciplined the child by whipping the child's arms and back with a belt or stick and then locking the child in a dark closet for up to 10 minutes; the child was afraid of the dark and would beat on the closet door and scream and cry to be released from the closet; and, when the child was six, the child attempted to commit suicide to avoid being hurt by the defendant anymore, and because the child was scared of the defendant.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contact with minor by probationer.</b> - Because sufficient evidence showed that the probationer approached a minor girl and offered that girl candy and admitted having incidental contact with minors, when these actions were explicitly prohibited as a condition of the probationer's probation, once the probationer reported this contact and the victim of that contact corroborated the report, the court did not abuse the court's discretion in revoking the probationer's probation term.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to complete treatment.</b> - Evidence was sufficient to support the revocation of the defendant's probation because of the defendant's failure to complete treatment, a specific condition of the defendant's probation.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lying at plea hearing established.</b> - Revocation of the appellant's probation was affirmed because evidence was sufficient based on testimony of a witness that the appellant had lied at a plea hearing to exonerate the witness and the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion when the court overruled the appellant's best evidence objection to witness testimony since the rule did not require production of a document simply because the document contained facts testified to by the witness.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Theft by receiving insufficient for probation revocation.</b> - Revocation of defendant's probation based on theft by receiving was clearly erroneous as a stolen vehicle was seen at the defendant's home and later found in a yard next door to the defendant's home, but there was no evidence that defendant was ever in possession or control of the vehicle, which was a necessary element of theft by receiving.

<p class="p4"><b>Revocation based on unpaid fine erroneous.</b> - Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probation based, in part, upon the court's finding that the defendant violated the condition of probation that required the defendant to pay a fine because the record did not reflect that on or before the date of the revocation order that any balance was due.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to pay fines and fees.</b> - Trial court committed reversible error in revoking the defendant's probation for failure to pay court-ordered fines and fees because the trial court made the court's determination without making the findings the United States Supreme Court required in revocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution, but rather, the trial court inquired only as to the defendant's fitness to work before deciding to revoke the defendant's probation; in order to revoke the defendant's probation based solely on the failure to pay those costs, the trial court was required to make a finding as to the defendant's wilfulness, and if the court concluded that the defendant was not at fault, the trial court was required to consider other punishment alternatives, which the court did not do.

<p class="p4"><b>Violation of special condition.</b> - Since the conditions of defendant's probation did not include payment of restitution, costs, or fines, and were imposed by the original sentencing court, the balance of the probation was erroneously revoked under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(c).

<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient drug evidence for probation revocation.</b> - Where defendant's mother was also a previously convicted drug violator; the cocaine and money were in defendant's mother's possession; nothing was found on defendant's person; and during the period of time in which the house was under surveillance, the defendant had not been seen entering or leaving the house, this evidence did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated the defendant's probation by possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. Anderson v. State, 212 Ga. App. 329, 442 S.E.2d 268 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">That a defendant's criminal conviction for trafficking in cocaine was reversed on appeal did not mean that revoking the defendant's probation on the basis of the same trafficking offense was automatically error; the criminal prosecution and the revocation proceeding were separate matters. The validity of the probation revocation was reviewed only in light of the evidence adduced at the revocation hearing. Defendant's probation was improperly revoked because the defendant's alleged trafficking in cocaine had not been established by a preponderance of the evidence as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(b). An informant's hearsay statements were not competent to show the defendant arranged a drug sale and no evidence connected the defendant with cocaine found in a house. Brown v. State, 294 Ga. App. 1, 668 S.E.2d 490 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence did not support the revocation of the defendant's probation pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34.1(b) since, after objections to hearsay evidence were sustained, the evidence did not support a finding that the defendant sold cocaine and marijuana; the only admissible evidence showed that the defendant took something out of a pocket and gave it to two men in exchange for money, and then the two men were taken into custody and found to have cocaine and marijuana in their possession.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probation because the evidence was insufficient to support the court's finding that the defendant committed the new offense of possession of less than one ounce of marijuana since the state presented no evidence other than the defendant's mere spatial proximity to the marijuana to support a finding that the defendant had the intent to exercise dominion and control over the marijuana. Smith v. State, 306 Ga. App. 54, 701 S.E.2d 490 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court manifestly abused the court's discretion by granting the state's petition to revoke probation because the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the probationer possessed marijuana with intent to distribute; the state showed only that the probationer was at the open front door of a trailer and that a sandwich bag of marijuana was found in a closed container inside a closet in a bedroom, but the evidence showed that other individuals had access to the trailer, including a man who sold drugs to a confidential informant.

<p class="p4"><b>Probationer dismissed from drug treatment program insufficient grounds for revocation.</b> - Trial court manifestly abused the court's discretion by granting the state's petition to revoke probation because the evidence was insufficient to find that the probationer's discharge from a day center program was the result of any voluntary or willful conduct on the probationer's part; the probationer's own actions did not cause the probationer to be dismissed from the drug treatment program.

<p class="p4"><b>Violation of work release program not proven for probation revocation.</b> - Trial court abused the court's discretion by revoking a defendant's probation because the state failed to prove that the conduct that formed the basis of the court's revocation order was expressly forbidden by any terms of the work-release program. Specifically, the allegation that the defendant "violated a court ordered work release program" was insufficient to satisfy due process, and the state failed to offer any evidence that the defendant was informed of the rules of the work-release program.

<p class="p4"><b>Violation not established by preponderance of the evidence.</b> - Evidence presented during hearing held to determine if defendant's probation should be revoked did not show that defendant did not intend to fulfill the terms of defendant's agreement to locate a car for a buyer, or that defendant had a fraudulent intent when defendant wrote a post-dated check that was dishonored when the buyer presented it for payment; the appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment finding that defendant committed theft by deception and revoking defendant's probation.

<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient evidence of victim for probation of revocation.</b> - Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probationary sentence because the evidence was insufficient to find that the defendant violated the condition of probation that the defendant have no contact with the victim; no evidence was presented suggesting that the defendant authored untrue statements about the victim, which were posted on several websites, in order to get in touch with or communicate with the victim.

<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient weapon possession evidence for probation revocation.</b> - Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probation on the ground that the defendant violated a condition of the probation by possessing a firearm because the state did not carry the state's burden of showing that the defendant was in possession of the rifle found leaning against the front porch of the defendant's trailer since the probation officer acknowledged that the rifle could have belonged to any one of the defendant's neighbors; there must be something more than mere spatial proximity that links the probationer to the prohibited item.

Electronic monitoring devices offer effective means to track individuals and may reduce criminal recidivism as well as provide the state with monetary savings since the cost of an electronic monitoring device is far less than the cost of incarcerating an individual and an individual may be able to pay for the device. The criminal penalties provided by this Act are designed to encourage the use of electronic monitoring devices while at the same time discourage interference with these devices." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Warrantless searches vs. warrantless arrests.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a probationer's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the probationer's apartment as, even though the entry into the apartment for the purpose of effecting an arrest of the probationer was permissible, most of the evidence was seized without a warrant after the probationer was not found in the apartment and had to be excluded under the Fourth Amendment as the search conducted was only permissible insofar as the search involved the observation of items of obvious evidentiary value in plain view during the time and activities required to attempt the probationer's arrest. The probationer was never placed on notice that the probationer was going to be subjected to warrantless searches, and the state failed to demonstrate any exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search.

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority of court to set terms and conditions.</b> - This section is not exclusive in its provisions, but places upon the court authority to set terms of probation and thereafter lists certain conditions which the court may impose if the court sees fit. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959); Gay v. State, 101 Ga. App. 225, 113 S.E.2d 223 (1960); Falkenhainer v. State, 122 Ga. App. 478, 177 S.E.2d 380 (1970); Marshall v. State, 127 Ga. App. 805, 195 S.E.2d 469 (1972); Geiger v. State, 140 Ga. App. 800, 232 S.E.2d 109 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial judge is not limited to imposition of only those restrictions enumerated in this section. Clackler v. State, 130 Ga. App. 738, 204 S.E.2d 472 (1974); Giddens v. State, 156 Ga. App. 258, 274 S.E.2d 595 (1980); Parkerson v. State, 156 Ga. App. 440, 274 S.E.2d 799 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This section permits the court to determine the terms and conditions of probation, and lists ten conditions of probation. Parkerson v. State, 156 Ga. App. 440, 274 S.E.2d 799 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Absent inclusion of a record and an express authority to the contrary, the trial judge was authorized to impose attendance at the Chatham County DUI court treatment program as a condition of the defendant's probation; further, imposition was not a denial of the defendant's equal protection rights in that nonresidents were not required to attend, especially and in light of the fact that the defendant failed to show any evidence to show the genesis, nature, or content of the program of which<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the defendant complained. Kellam v. State, 271 Ga. App. 125, 608 S.E.2d 729 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant that the cited probation conditions were peculiar to a DUI conviction, because the defendant failed to cite any authority showing that a court abused the court's discretion in imposing the condition's upon a probated sentence for serious injury by vehicle, when DUI was the predicate offense, and the defendant failed to show that any such condition was unreasonable or failed to serve the main goals of probation, the appeals court saw no reason why the cited conditions could not be imposed upon a probated sentence for serious injury by vehicle. Hannah v. State, 280 Ga. App. 230, 633 S.E.2d 800 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In overruling the defendant's objection to the probation imposed, the trial court erroneously deferred to the probation department in stating that any invalid conditions could be removed by the probation department; the appeals court disapproved of such a practice as O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-35(a) provided that only the court was to determine the terms and conditions of probation. Grovenstein v. State, 282 Ga. App. 109, 637 S.E.2d 821 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Special probation conditions, requiring that the defendant complete a driving under the influence risk reduction course under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-391(c), perform 40 hours of community service under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-391(c), and pay a $25 photograph fee under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-391(j)(1), (2), were not an abuse of discretion despite the fact that the conditions of probation were not imposed upon the defendant's driving under the influence conviction, for which probation was not imposed, but were instead imposed on the defendant's sentence of probation on the related convictions; while the defendant claimed that the conditions were peculiar to a driving under the influence conviction, the conditions were reasonably related to the nature of the offenses and the rehabilitative goals of probation pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-35. Johnson v. State, 282 Ga. App. 258, 638 S.E.2d 406 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of polygraph test requirement.</b> - Condition requiring probationer to submit to polygraph tests does not violate the defendants' Fifth Amendment rights, and the condition may be imposed, in the discretion of the trial judge, with no more than a general finding of the court that it is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of probation. Mann v. State, 154 Ga. App. 677, 269 S.E.2d 863 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Confinement not "incarceration."</b> - Sentence of defendant based on first offender treatment, to five years' probation, conditioned upon successive periods of confinement in a detention center, a diversion center, and in defendant's house under intensive supervision, was authorized and did not constitute "incarceration," which refers to continuous and uninterrupted custody in a jail or penitentiary. Penaherrera v. State, 211 Ga. App. 162, 438 S.E.2d 661 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition precluding contact between perpetrator of sexual crime and victim.</b> - Imposition as a condition of probation that the defendant who was convicted of aggravated child molestation have no direct or indirect contact with the defendant's seven-year-old daughter until she reached the age of majority was within the discretion of the court, and was not a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights. Tuttle v. State, 215 Ga. App. 396, 450 S.E.2d 863 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition of probation that defendant live with parents</b> during course of probated sentences implicitly imposes restriction on defendant's parents, i.e., that the parents maintain a domicile for the defendant, and is unenforceable. Ward v. State, 248 Ga. 60, 281 S.E.2d 503 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suspension of defendant's hunting and fishing privileges</b> during the probation period imposed upon conviction of a violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 27-3-9, unlawful enticement of game, was not an abuse of discretion. Quintrell v. State, 231 Ga. App. 268, 499 S.E.2d 117 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition that defendant wear special bracelet.</b> - List in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-35 of conditions which may be imposed is not exclusive and the court had authority to impose the requirement that the defendant wear a fluorescent pink plastic bracelet imprinted with the words "D.U.I. CONVICT." Ballenger v. State, 210 Ga. App. 627, 436 S.E.2d 793 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition requiring child support payments.</b> - Condition requiring that the probationer make child support payments directly to his ex-wife was not unreasonable and served a legitimate purpose. Darby v. State, 230 Ga. App. 32, 495 S.E.2d 146 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition requiring curfew.</b> - Probation condition stating that "Defendant will submit a schedule of weekly activities to the probation officer and will be subject to curfews at the officer's discretion" was not improper. Tyler v. State, 279 Ga. App. 809, 632 S.E.2d 716 (2006), cert. denied, No. S06C1818, 2006 Ga. LEXIS 810 (Ga. 2006), overruled on other grounds, Schofield v. Holsey, 281 Ga. 809, 642 S.E.2d 56 (2007), overruled on other grounds by State v. Lane, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 98 (Ga. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Danger to probationer.</b> - Court would reverse a sentence which required the defendant, as a condition of probation, to wear a placard stating "BEWARE HIGH CRIME AREA" for a certain number of hours while walking through the area where the defendant committed the defendant's offense since the sign itself indicated that the defendant would be patrolling in a high crime area and, therefore, this would result in the defendant being placed in danger. Williams v. State, 234 Ga. App. 37, 505 S.E.2d 816 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Incarceration not imposable as condition for probation.</b> - In the absence of express statutory authority recognizing continuous and uninterrupted incarceration in a jail or penitentiary as a viable condition of probation, the imposition of any term of continuous and uninterrupted incarceration in a jail or penitentiary as a special condition of probation is unauthorized by law. Pitts v. State, 206 Ga. App. 635, 426 S.E.2d 257 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition for sex offenders imposed.</b> - Trial court was authorized to conclude that the defendant's conduct of secretly videotaping the defendant's stepdaughter while she was in the nude was by its nature a sexual offense against a minor or criminal sexual conduct toward a minor. The court, therefore, did not err in exercising the court's broad discretion to impose upon the defendant special conditions of probation for sex offenders. Price v. State, 320 Ga. App. 85, 738 S.E.2d 289 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant's sentence, including a condition that the defendant have no contact with the defendant's stepdaughter whom the defendant had molested and their son, born as a result of the molestation, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-35, was not indeterminate and was not illegal, the defendant's motion to modify the sentence under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-1 was barred by a waiver in the defendant's plea agreement. Jones v. State, 348 Ga. App. 653, 824 S.E.2d 575 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Collection of electronic monitoring fees by private probation service.</b> - Trial court erred by finding that electronic monitoring fees imposed by the sentencing court and collected by a private probation service for monitoring services rendered during a probationer's original term of sentence were prohibited because only when electronic monitoring was unlawfully imposed by the court on a misdemeanor probationer after the expiration of the probationer's original sentence would such fees potentially be recoverable. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC v. Glover, 296 Ga. 315, 766 S.E.2d 456 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>2. Avoid Injurious and Vicious Habits</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prohibition against alcohol consumption.</b> - Prohibition against consumption of alcohol as condition of probation is authorized by paragraph (1) of this section. An alcoholic is not exempt from such a condition. Mock v. State, 156 Ga. App. 763, 275 S.E.2d 393 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition against engaging in profession for certain period.</b> - Condition that defendant not engage in practice of law for a period of one year was within the sound discretion of the court in probating the sentence, and was authorized under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2702 and Ga. L. 1965, p. 413, <span class="s1">§</span> 3 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-8-34 and 42-8-35). Yarbrough v. State, 119 Ga. App. 46, 166 S.E.2d 35 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>3. Confinement to Specified Location</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Diversion center.</b> - Probationer is not subject to prosecution for the felony offense of escape, after the probationer fails to return to a diversion center from which the probationer is given permission to leave. Chandler v. State, 257 Ga. 775, 364 S.E.2d 273 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Banishment.</b> - Banishment of one convicted of crime from county or counties may be a reasonable condition of probation. Parkerson v. State, 156 Ga. App. 440, 274 S.E.2d 799 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">No section or other authority grants jurisdiction to trial court to banish a person other than the convicted criminal as a condition of the criminal's probation. Parkerson v. State, 156 Ga. App. 440, 274 S.E.2d 799 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Habeas court properly denied the defendant's petition for habeas relief based on the contention that a condition of probation banishing the defendant from every county in the State of Georgia but one was unconstitutional as the defendant failed to show that the probation condition to remain in Toombs County only was unreasonable or otherwise failed to bear a logical relationship to the rehabilitative scheme of the sentence pronounced. The Supreme Court of Georgia noted that the banishment was justified to protect the victim, the defendant's ex-spouse, from the defendant's propensity for violence toward the victim. Terry v. Hamrick, 284 Ga. 24, 663 S.E.2d 256 (2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 510, 172 L. Ed. 2d 375 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in modifying the probationary portion of the defendant's sentence by imposing a condition banishing the defendant from the subdivision in which the defendant committed burglaries because the trial court's original sentencing order included as a special condition of probation that the defendant was to avoid all contact with the burglary victims, each of whom lived in the subdivision at issue, and to the extent that the modified sentence simply clarified the scope of that special condition, it was contemplated within the terms of the original sentence pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-34(g); the banishment provision was reasonable, narrow in scope, and included only the subdivision in which the victims resided, and in the absence of a hearing transcript or any record evidence to the contrary, the court of appeals had to presume that the trial court properly considered the evidence before the court. Tyson v. State, 301 Ga. App. 295, 687 S.E.2d 284 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the legislature has expressly provided that banishment is a valid term and condition of probation, the trial court cannot banish a probationer to any area within the state that does not consist of at least one entire judicial circuit. Because Toombs County was part of the five-county Middle Judicial Circuit, which also included Emanuel, Jefferson, Washington, and Candler Counties, the trial court was not statutorily authorized to banish the defendant from the entire state, except for Toombs County. Regent v. State, 333 Ga. App. 350, 774 S.E.2d 213 (2015), vacated on other grounds, 339 Ga. App. 885, 795 S.E.2d 190 (Ga. Ct. App. 2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Threat of refusal to abide by banishment.</b> - When the trial court imposes 20 year sentence with ten years thereof to be probated, conditional upon banishment of the defendant from the judicial circuit, threats by the defendant not to abide by probational banishment authorize the judge to impose a sentence of 20 years. Garland v. State, 160 Ga. App. 97, 286 S.E.2d 330 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of restitution condition.</b> - Sentence on a conviction for a fraudulent disposition of crops subject to a landlord's lien under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 61-9903 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-348), which provided for probation in lieu of a prison sentence on the condition that the landlord was repaid, was a valid and legal sentence and was not violative of Ga. Const. 1945, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XXI (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XXIII). Davis v. State, 53 Ga. App. 325, 185 S.E. 400 (1936) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Probation may be conditioned upon payment of expenses</b> in accordance with the conditions of probation. Giddens v. State, 156 Ga. App. 258, 274 S.E.2d 595 (1980), cert denied, 450 U.S. 1026, 101 S. Ct. 1733, 68 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Serving sentence outside detention center.</b> - Court may probate sentence to permit convicted person to serve sentence outside confines of place of detention "on such conditions as it may see fit," and this vests a broad power in the trial court, and restitution to an injured person or the person's property cannot be said to be a condition in violation of that power. Henry v. State, 77 Ga. App. 735, 49 S.E.2d 681 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice and hearing requirements.</b> - Prior notice and an opportunity to be heard are prerequisite where restitution is ordered by court to be paid out of a probationer's weekly salary and the penalty for failure to pay is imprisonment. Morgan v. Wofford, 472 F.2d 822 (5th Cir. 1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Effect of fixing amount of restitution required to be paid under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, without notice to the probationer and without any opportunity for probationer to question or appeal amount, especially when criminal sanctions may be involved, violates the Fourteenth Amendment, since due process requires notice and an opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case when the state seeks to deprive a person of property or liberty. Morgan v. Wofford, 472 F.2d 822 (5th Cir. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contesting restitution condition.</b> - Recourse for defendant who does not agree to amount of restitution ordered by trial court is to contest the issue at the time the condition is imposed. Johnson v. State, 156 Ga. App. 511, 274 S.E.2d 669 (1980); Johnson v. State, 157 Ga. App. 155, 276 S.E.2d 667 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellant's plea of guilty to accusation and execution of written acknowledgment of conditions of probation did not constitute an agreement to the value of stolen property for purposes of restitution. Johnson v. State, 156 Ga. App. 511, 274 S.E.2d 669 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the appellant failed to dispute or contest amount of restitution ordered by the trial court, restitution was properly imposed without an adjudication. Cobb v. State, 162 Ga. App. 314, 291 S.E.2d 390 (1982); Patrick v. State, 184 Ga. App. 260, 361 S.E.2d 251 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant is only entitled to adjudication of the restitutionary amount when that amount is in dispute. Johnston v. State, 165 Ga. App. 792, 302 S.E.2d 708 (1983); Williams v. State, 180 Ga. App. 854, 350 S.E.2d 837 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since the defendant failed to dispute the amount of restitution ordered as a condition of probation for theft by taking, and the state failed to prove the amount at trial is of no consequence, because the state was only required to prove that the defendant stole in excess of $200.00 (now $500.00) under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-8-12(a)(1). Johnston v. State, 165 Ga. App. 792, 302 S.E.2d 708 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the amount of medical expenses of a juvenile assault victim is undisputed based on the uncontradicted testimony of the victim in the disposition hearing, there is no error in ordering restitution. C.P. v. State, 167 Ga. App. 374, 306 S.E.2d 688 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the defendant voiced no objection in the trial court to the interest charged as part of the amount of restitution, the defendant may not complain of it on appeal. Corbin v. State, 202 Ga. App. 464, 415 S.E.2d 14 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restitution as condition.</b> - While the defendant may not be sentenced to make restitution, the court may make restitution a condition of probation. Biddy v. State, 138 Ga. App. 4, 225 S.E.2d 448 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining nature of restitution order.</b> - Elements of O.C.G.A. T. 17, Ch. 14 may be used to discern nature of order of restitution made under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-35. This can be done since under <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-35 "restitution" was an authorized condition of probation and the enactment of T. 17, Ch. 14 "is merely a more detailed enactment regarding restitution." Newton v. Fred Haley Poultry Farm, 15 Bankr. 708 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition for restoration of driver's license.</b> - Restitution of damages to other persons involved in an automobile accident may not be imposed as a condition for restoration of a driver's license in such cases when the amount is in dispute, unless the issue has been adjudicated because a party may be guilty of violating the traffic laws and be found not liable in a civil suit for damages. Payne v. State, 138 Ga. App. 358, 226 S.E.2d 152 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restitution permissible despite scheduling obligation owed creditor.</b> - Trial court is empowered to stipulate as a condition of probation that restitution shall be made to the aggrieved party despite the defendant having scheduled the obligation owing the creditor in bankruptcy proceedings. Marshall v. State, 127 Ga. App. 805, 195 S.E.2d 469 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restitution based on untried charge improper.</b> - When there was no accusation or evidence relating to a particular theft, the trial court cannot order restitution for that theft as a condition of probation even if the court was aware of an untried charge relating to that theft. Robinson v. State, 169 Ga. App. 763, 315 S.E.2d 277 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Repayment of salary.</b> - Trial court may, as a condition of probation, require repayment of the salary received by a county officer while the officer was suspended. LaPann v. State, 167 Ga. App. 288, 306 S.E.2d 373 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reimbursement of costs of representation.</b> - Georgia Indigent Defense Act, in replacing former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-12-10(c), did not preclude a trial court from ordering restitution of attorney fees as part of the court's general power to impose reasonable conditions of probation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-35; thus, a defendant was properly ordered to reimburse the costs of the defendant's legal representation, and that aspect of the defendant's sentence was not a nullity. State v. Pless, 282 Ga. 58, 646 S.E.2d 202 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of purported probation sentence.</b> - Sentences for criminal offenses should be certain, definite, and free from ambiguity, and, when the contrary is the case, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused. Hence, the trial court erred in revoking a purported probation sentence since construed as a whole, the sentence was an alternative one and the defendant was to be discharged upon payment of fines and costs. Favors v. State, 95 Ga. App. 318, 97 S.E.2d 613 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Service of sentence on probation as privilege.</b> - Service of sentence on probation is conferred as privilege and cannot be demanded as a matter of right, but this does not mean that a defendant's liberty is something that can be the subject matter of whim or fancy of the trial judge. Cross v. Huff, 208 Ga. 392, 67 S.E.2d 124 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2702 and 27-2705 prior to revision by Ga. L. 1956, p. 27, <span class="s1">§§</span> 1, 21).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>2. Procedural Requirements</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority of judge to suspend or probate sentence.</b> - Judge imposing a sentence is granted power to suspend or probate the sentence under such rules and regulations as the judge thinks proper. Cross v. Huff, 208 Ga. 392, 67 S.E.2d 124 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judge has the right and authority to revoke the suspension or probation, after notice and a hearing, when the defendant violates any of the rules and regulations prescribed by the court. Simmons v. State, 96 Ga. App. 718, 101 S.E.2d 111 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2702 and 27-2705, prior to revision by Ga. L. 1956, p. 27, <span class="s1">§§</span> 1, 21).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice or hearing required for sentence revocation.</b> Balkcom v. Gunn, 206 Ga. 167, 56 S.E.2d 482 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, T. 27, including <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2702 and 27-2705, prior to revision by Ga. L. 1956, p. 27, <span class="s1">§§</span> 1, 21).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of notice.</b> - Notice must be sufficient to inform the defendant of the manner in which the defendant has violated the defendant's parole and give the defendant an opportunity to defend. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Some evidence required for revocation of probation.</b> - While the trial court has a wide discretion in revoking a probated sentence, and while only slight evidence will support a judgment of revocation, some evidence that the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probated sentence as charged in the notice given the defendant of the revocation hearing is required. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959); Gay v. State, 101 Ga. App. 225, 113 S.E.2d 223 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence held insufficient.</b> - Evidence was insufficient when notice contained in special order of arrest charged the defendant with manufacturing illicit whiskey, but no evidence was introduced; mere fact that the defendant was operating a truck loaded with sugar, and the defendant refused to give the name of the purchaser or seller of the sugar and had no bill of lading or bill of sale for the sugar, which facts were perfectly consistent with the defendant's contention that the defendant was doing some hauling, was of itself not sufficient to authorize revocation of the probation order. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When notice contained in order of arrest failed to charge the defendant with violation of the provision of the probation order prohibiting the defendant from leaving the state without permission, mere fact that the defendant was stopped in Alabama was not sufficient ground for revocation thereof. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Matters to be considered in revoking probation.</b> - Since the court cannot revoke a probated sentence unless the sentence has conditions sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and unless the conditions have not been complied with, and since the defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the charge which is brought against the defendant, only those alleged violations which are terms of the original sentence, and notice of the violation of which has been given the probationer, may be considered by the court on the hearing to revoke the probated sentence. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>3. Violation of Rules or Regulations</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Need for prescribed rules and regulations.</b> - When no rules or regulations are prescribed in the alleged suspended or probated sentence, and no violation of a prescribed rule or regulation is alleged, the court is without authority to order the defendant incarcerated upon the theory that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of a probation sentence. Morgan v. Foster, 208 Ga. 630, 68 S.E.2d 583 (1952); Simmons v. State, 96 Ga. App. 718, 101 S.E.2d 111 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2702, 27-2705, and 27-2706, prior to revision by Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Probated sentences must show rules and regulations prescribed</b> so that a violation of such rules and regulations will revoke probation. Simmons v. State, 96 Ga. App. 718, 101 S.E.2d 111 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2702 and 27-2705, prior to revision by Ga. L. 1956, p. 27, <span class="s1">§§</span> 1, 21); George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion to impose non-specified restrictions.</b> - Court has authority to impose restrictions not specifically listed in this section, and among them the restriction that the defendant shall not violate the penal laws of the state. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Strict construction.</b> - Statutes providing for suspension of a sentence or probation of defendant must be strictly followed. Cross v. Huff, 208 Ga. 392, 67 S.E.2d 124 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2702 and 27-2705, prior to revision by Ga. L. 1956, p. 27, <span class="s1">§§</span> 1, 21).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language held not so vague as to be unenforceable.</b> - Provision in a probation sentence that the "sentence is suspended on payment of fine and on the further condition that defendant not violate laws of this state, and until further order of this court," is not so vague, indefinite, ambiguous, and uncertain as to be unenforceable; the laws of this state being fixed by statute and presumed to be within the knowledge of every competent person. Bryant v. State, 89 Ga. App. 891, 81 S.E.2d 556 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2705).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probation sentence held unenforceable.</b> - If the words, "maintain a correct life" are intended to impose any condition upon the defendant over and beyond compliance with the rules prescribed for the defendant's conduct by the court, the words are too vague, indefinite, and uncertain to be given any construction or application. Morgan v. Foster, 208 Ga. 630, 68 S.E.2d 583 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2705 and 27-2706, prior to revision by Ga. L. 1956, p. 27, <span class="s1">§</span> 21).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Condition applicable for probated sentence applies to suspended sentence.</b> - Condition which would be authorized in the case of a probated sentence would be authorized in the case of a suspended sentence. Falkenhainer v. State, 122 Ga. App. 478, 177 S.E.2d 380 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Releasing defendant without prescribing conditions or rules.</b> - When no conditions or rules are prescribed by the court for the conduct of the defendant, the defendant's release at the direction of the court upon payment of a fine is not a suspended or probated sentence, but an unconditional discharge. The words, "until further order of the court," appearing in the sentence, are insufficient to constitute a suspended sentence or probation. Morgan v. Foster, 208 Ga. 630, 68 S.E.2d 583 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2705 and 27-2706 prior to revision by Ga.

<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Scope of section.</b> - Since the defendant was sentenced to the county jail when not at work, the defendant could not be considered to be on probation, thus an action by the trial court to modify and extend the defendant's sentence under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38 was a nullity, since <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38 relates solely to revocation of probation. Howell v. State, 160 Ga. App. 562, 287 S.E.2d 573 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When probation may be revoked or modified.</b> - Probated portion of a sentence may be revoked or modified at any time during the term of the probated sentence after hearing and finding of probation violation. Logan v. Lee, 247 Ga. 608, 278 S.E.2d 1 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determination of revocation.</b> - Even when a condition of probation has not been complied with, circumstances of an individual defendant must be taken into consideration in determining whether revocation is warranted. Malcom v. State, 162 Ga. App. 587, 291 S.E.2d 756 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of exoneration and discharge was void.</b> - Trial court's 1998 sentencing order denying the defendant exoneration and discharge was void as a matter of law because the state never filed a motion for revocation; thus, exoneration and discharge was automatic under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(e), (g), and (h), and the defendant's motion to correct the void sentence was improperly denied. Collins v. State, 338 Ga. App. 886, 792 S.E.2d 134 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Increase of sentence.</b> - While the trial court has jurisdiction to change or modify the terms of the original sentence, it cannot increase the sentence originally passed. Howell v. State, 160 Ga. App. 562, 287 S.E.2d 573 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probationary status only to be considered.</b> - Subsection (c) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38 limits the power of the trial court to a decision affecting only the probationary status of the previously convicted probationer. In no way does it provide for the imposition of a sentence of any kind based upon the charge underlying an alleged violation of the terms of a previously ordered probation. Abney v. State, 170 Ga. App. 265, 316 S.E.2d 845 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation of diversion center regulations.</b> - It was error to hold that a probationer's failure to abide by the diversion center's regulations made the probationer liable for the felony offense of escape rather than for the mere revocation of the probationer's probation. Unsatisfactory performance in the program would subject the probationer to revocation of probation as specified by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38; however, an alternative to revocation of probation would be the imposition of the more severe sanctions of O.C.G.A.<span class="s1">§</span> 16-10-52(a)(3) (redesignated as (a)(5) in 1997). When any uncertainty develops as to which penal clause is applicable, the accused is entitled to have the lesser of two penalties administered. Chandler v. State, 257 Ga. 775, 364 S.E.2d 273 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure to revoke probation on subsequent criminal trial.</b> - That the quantum of proof necessary to revoke probation has been changed from "slight evidence" to "a preponderance of the evidence" does not affect the rule that a ruling in favor of the probationer, continuing rather than revoking probation, has no collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent criminal trial. State v. Jones, 196 Ga. App. 896, 397 S.E.2d 209 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unambiguous revocation of probation not subject to subsequent adjustment.</b> - After the defendant received a sentence which unambiguously revoked the defendant's prior probation, the defendant fully served the time imposed therein, and there was no indication in the sentence that any portion of the defendant's probation was to be reinstated upon the defendant's release, that sentence was fully satisfied when the defendant was released from jail, and the court's order subsequently revoking the defendant's probation was invalid as there was nothing left to revoke. Hulen v. State, 207 Ga. App. 465, 428 S.E.2d 405 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicable period.</b> - Trial court misinterpreted O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38(a) as dealing with matters which were done within the period of probation when the court denied the state's petition to revoke a probationer's probation.

<p class="p4">When a convicted defendant's "future good behavior" has already been compromised by the commission of another criminal act even before the formal probationary period begins, a trial court should not be required to allow such defendant to serve a previously imposed probated sentence when the court deems that protection of society demands revocation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The trial court's interpretation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38(a) as precluding the exercise of the court's discretion to consider the state's petition to revoke the defendant's probation was an error as a matter of law.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Warrantless searches vs. warrantless arrests.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a probationer's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the probationer's apartment as, even though the entry into the apartment for the purpose of effecting an arrest of the probationer was permissible, most of the evidence seized without a warrant after the probationer was not found in the apartment had to be excluded under the Fourth Amendment as the search conducted was only permissible insofar as the search involved the observation of items of obvious evidentiary value in plain view during the time and activities required to attempt the probationer's arrest. The probationer was never placed on notice that the probationer was going to be subjected to warrantless searches, and the state failed to demonstrate any exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of probation based upon unprosecuted crime.</b> - Revocation of probation based at least in part upon alleged commission of a crime for which a party has not yet stood trial and been found guilty does not contravene principles of due process and fundamental fairness. King v. State, 154 Ga. App. 549, 269 S.E.2d 55 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation by different court.</b> - Probation may be revoked by a court of equivalent original criminal jurisdiction when the probationer's county of supervision and residence is different from the county of original conviction. Biddy v. State, 132 Ga. App. 264, 208 S.E.2d 22 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judge in the Dublin judicial circuit had jurisdiction to revoke a former prisoner's probation because: (1) while the prisoner pled guilty in the Macon judicial circuit and the prisoner's sentence was probated, the prisoner was involved in a theft which resulted in a partial revocation of probation and assignment to a probation detention center in the Dublin judicial circuit and, during the prisoner's confinement in the Dublin judicial circuit, the prisoner violated the terms of the prisoner's probation; and (2) because the prisoner was under supervision in a judicial circuit other than that of the prisoner's conviction, the prisoner was properly returned to a court of equivalent original criminal jurisdiction within the county wherein the prisoner was residing for the purposes of supervision under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38(a). Williams v. Donald,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(M.D. Ga. Aug. 14, 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation based on felony.</b> - When an act on which revocation of probation is based is a felony, it is not erroneous for the hearing judge to base revocation on that accusation, before the accused shall have first been tried and found guilty of the criminal charge. Evans v. State, 153 Ga. App. 764, 266 S.E.2d 545 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion following technical probation violations.</b> - Following technical violations of the conditions of probation, short of conviction for another crime or a determination of initial ineligibility, the trial court had discretion to continue a first offender on probation without first revoking first offender status, entering an adjudication of guilt, or resentencing for the underlying offense. Mohammed v. State, 226 Ga. App. 387, 486 S.E.2d 652 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nothing in O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 42-8-38 ties the affidavit requirement for the issuance of arrest warrants to the validity of a subsequent revocation of probation.</b> Even if the defendant's arrest on charges of violating the defendant's probation was illegal, that is not a bar to the subsequent revocation of the defendant's probation. Walker v. State, 289 Ga. App. 879, 658 S.E.2d 375 (2008), overruled on other grounds, Gordon v. State, 334 Ga. App. 633, 780 S.E.2d 376 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question as to excessiveness of sentence.</b> - Any question as to the excessiveness of a sentence which is otherwise legal should be addressed to the sentence review panel. Strickland v. State, 158 Ga. App. 340, 280 S.E.2d 168 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Findings when record sufficient.</b> - When the record from which basis for revocation can be ascertained is sufficient, it is not necessary for the trier of fact to commit the judge's findings to a separate piece of paper. Hayes v. State, 168 Ga. App. 94, 308 S.E.2d 227 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Separate hearing after grounds for revocation discovered.</b> - Court need not hold separate dispositional or sentencing hearing after finding grounds for revocation of probation. Hayes v. State, 157 Ga. App. 659, 278 S.E.2d 424 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Persons empowered to make warrantless arrest of probation violators.</b> - Power to make a warrantless arrest of a known probation violator is not limited to the probation supervisor, but also includes a law enforcement officer with general arrest powers who has trustworthy information as to the probation violation. Battle v. State, 254 Ga. 666, 333 S.E.2d 599 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>2. Necessity for Prescribed Rules and Regulations</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose for showing rules and regulations prescribed.</b> - Probated sentences must show the rules and regulations prescribed so that a violation of such rules and regulations will revoke the parole. Simmons v. State, 96 Ga. App. 718, 101 S.E.2d 111 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ambiguous sentence construed in favor of defendant.</b> - Trial court erred in revoking purported probation sentence since construed as a whole, the sentence was an alternative one and the defendant was to be discharged upon payment of the fines and costs. Favors v. State, 95 Ga. App. 318, 97 S.E.2d 613 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violations considered by court at probated sentence revocation hearing.</b> - Since the court cannot revoke a probated sentence unless that sentence has conditions sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and unless those conditions have not been complied with, and since the defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the charge which is brought against the defendant, only those alleged violations which are terms of the original sentence, and notice of the violation of which has been given the probationer, may be considered by the court on the hearing to revoke the probated sentence. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation must be based on ground stated in petition.</b> - When the trial court erroneously ruled that "theft by disposing" is a lesser included offense of theft by taking, revocation of the defendant's probation could not stand because the revocation was not made on the ground stated in the petition. Sosbee v. State, 155 Ga. App. 196, 270 S.E.2d 367 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>3. Constitutional Requirements</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>A. In General</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probation as privilege.</b> - Probation is granted as a privilege, and not as a matter of right; and revocation of probation is punishment for the crime for which the defendant was convicted in the first instance. Scott v. State, 131 Ga. App. 504, 206 S.E.2d 137 (1974); Heard v. State, 154 Ga. App. 420, 268 S.E.2d 757 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of double jeopardy clause.</b> - Because parole and probation revocation proceedings are not designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law and, because the purpose of parole and probation revocation proceedings is to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of the probationer's parole or probation, such proceedings are fundamentally distinguishable from juvenile proceedings, the latter being indistinguishable from a criminal prosecution, and, thus, the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const., amend. 5 does not apply to parole and probation revocation proceedings. United States v. Whitney, 649 F.2d 296 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation based on failure to pay restitution.</b> - Revocation of probation, premised upon failure to timely pay court ordered restitution, does not violate due process and equal protection. Wilson v. State, 155 Ga. App. 825, 273 S.E.2d 210 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Minimum requirements of due process for parole revocation</b> are: a written statement by the fact finders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole. Reed v. State, 151 Ga. App. 224, 259 S.E.2d 209 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although this section does not require it, "a written statement by the fact finders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking probation" has been established as a minimum due process requirement in assuring the constitutional rights of an individual who will be condemned to suffer grievous loss by restraint of liberty. Moore v. State, 151 Ga. App. 791, 261 S.E.2d 730 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contents of revocation order.</b> - Order revoking probation must state evidence relied upon and reasons for revocation. Rey v. State, 156 Ga. App. 474, 274 S.E.2d 822 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of uncorroborated accomplice testimony in hearing.</b> - When uncorroborated accomplice testimony is shown inherently to lack credit, or is sufficiently controverted, abuse of discretion in admitting it in hearing may become manifest. Christy v. State, 134 Ga. App. 504, 215 S.E.2d 267 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>B. Notice</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice and hearing required for revocation.</b> - When probation is sought to be revoked, the defendant is entitled to notice, which notice must be sufficient to inform the defendant of the manner in which the defendant has violated the defendant's parole and give the defendant an opportunity to defend. George v. State, 99 Ga. App. 892, 109 S.E.2d 883 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Failure to afford probationer notice and a hearing would render a revocation order void for lack of due process of law. Sellers v. State, 107 Ga. App. 516, 130 S.E.2d 790 (1963); Scott v. State, 131 Ga. App. 504, 206 S.E.2d 137 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In order to revoke the probationary features of a sentence the defendant must have notice and opportunity to be heard, the notice being sufficient to inform the defendant not only of the time and place of the hearing and the fact that revocation is sought, but the grounds upon which it is based. Horton v. State, 122 Ga. App. 106, 176 S.E.2d 287 (1970). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a person is placed under a probation sentence, probation cannot be revoked without notice to the probationer and an opportunity to be heard on the question as to whether the probationer violated its terms. Rainwater v. State, 127 Ga. App. 406, 193 S.E.2d 889 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of slight evidence rule.</b> - When the defendant received written notice of the claimed violation of probation, the disclosure of the evidence against the defendant, an opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and document evidence, the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, heard by a neutral and detached judicial officer, with a written statement by the fact finder as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking probation, application of the "slight evidence" rule did not deny the defendant due process and equal protection. Mingo v. State, 155 Ga. App. 284, 270 S.E.2d 700 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>C. Hearing</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time period between petition and hearing.</b> - Absent special circumstances, 30 days is a reasonable time period between petition and hearing, for the sake of both the state and the offender. Anderson v. State, 166 Ga. App. 521, 304 S.E.2d 747 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of a probation revocation hearing is to</b> determine whether the conduct of the defendant during the probation period has conformed to the terms and conditions outlined in the order of probation. Evans v. State, 153 Ga. App. 764, 266 S.E.2d 545 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Form of meeting.</b> - Hearing required need not meet the requisites of a jury trial; the proceedings may be informal or summary. Rainwater v. State, 127 Ga. App. 406, 193 S.E.2d 889 (1972); Wellons v. State, 144 Ga. App. 218, 240 S.E.2d 768 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of rules of evidence.</b> - Rules of evidence of normal criminal proceedings are not applicable to a hearing under this section and evidentiary matters are within the discretion of the trial judge. Christy v. State, 134 Ga. App. 504, 215 S.E.2d 267 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of preliminary hearing to establish probable cause for revocation hearing.</b> - Failure of trial court to afford a preliminary hearing to establish probable cause to conduct a revocation of probation hearing followed by an evidentiary show cause hearing, rather than consolidating the procedure into one hearing does not violate due process. Wilson v. State, 152 Ga. App. 695, 263 S.E.2d 691 (1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 847, 101 S. Ct. 133, 66 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Criminal nature of act violating probation.</b> - Hearing of this character is not a trial on a criminal charge, but is a hearing to judicially determine whether the conduct of the defendant during the probation period has conformed to the course outlined in the order of probation. If the act which violated the probation should happen to be a criminal one, it does not thereby change the character of the hearing. Sparks v. State, 77 Ga. App. 22, 47 S.E.2d 678 (1948); Johnson v. State, 214 Ga. 818, 108 S.E.2d 313 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fact that act alleged to be in violation of probation is of a criminal nature does not change character of revocation hearing. Robinson v. State, 154 Ga. App. 591, 269 S.E.2d 86 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stages for offering defenses.</b> - Fact that certain defenses could also be advanced in a trial upon the merits of the offense does not in any way drain the legal effect of a failure to offer defenses at the dispositional hearing. Wilson v. State, 152 Ga. App. 695, 263 S.E.2d 691 (1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 847, 101 S. Ct. 133, 66 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Accusation by indictment as opposed to violation of probationary conditions.</b> - Defendant is not in the position of one accused by indictment, even though the probationary condition alleged to have been violated is the commission of a crime. Jackson v. State, 140 Ga. App. 659, 231 S.E.2d 554 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court's discretion to grant motion for psychiatric examination.</b> - When no special plea of insanity is filed, the granting of a motion for a psychiatric examination is within the sound discretion of the trial court. This rule attaches in probation revocation hearings as well as in criminal proceedings. Mann v. State, 154 Ga. App. 677, 269 S.E.2d 863 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Review when no hearing transcript exists.</b> - When there is no transcript of hearing, an appellate court is bound to assume that the trial judge's findings are supported by sufficient competent evidence. Nalley v. State, 147 Ga. App. 634, 249 S.E.2d 685 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>D. Right to Counsel</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probation revocation hearing.</b> - There is no right to counsel at a probation revocation hearing. Mercer v. Hopper, 233 Ga. 620, 212 S.E.2d 799 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant is not ordinarily entitled to appointed counsel for a probation revocation hearing. Kemp v. Spradlin, 250 Ga. 829, 301 S.E.2d 874 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Indigent defendant.</b> - Indigent is not entitled to appointed counsel at the indigent's probation revocation hearing. Nalley v. State, 147 Ga. App. 634, 249 S.E.2d 685 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute providing for benefit of counsel.</b> - Proceeding to revoke a probated sentence of one convicted of a criminal offense is not a criminal proceeding, and the failure of the court to supply the convict with counsel is not a denial of the right to counsel unless a statute provides for benefit of counsel at such a hearing. Dutton v. Willis, 223 Ga. 209, 154 S.E.2d 221 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Circumstances requiring appointment of legal counsel.</b> - See Kemp v. Spradlin, 250 Ga. 829, 301 S.E.2d 874 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>E. Trial by Jury</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Ga. L. 1956, p. 27, <span class="s1">§</span> 12 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38) is not unconstitutional as a violation of Ga. Const. Art. I, Sec. I, Para. V (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI) because no provision is made for trial by jury upon the hearing to determine whether a parole shall be revoked. Probation is granted as a privilege, and not as a matter of right; and the revocation of the probation is punishment for the crime for which the defendant was convicted in the first instance. Johnson v. State, 214 Ga. 818, 108 S.E.2d 313 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probationer not guaranteed trial by jury.</b> - Hearing on a revocation is not a trial on a criminal charge and the probationer has no right to a trial by jury. Sellers v. State, 107 Ga. App. 516, 130 S.E.2d 790 (1963); Scott v. State, 131 Ga. App. 504, 206 S.E.2d 137 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>F. Search and Seizures</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Basis for reasonable search by probation officer.</b> - Search by a probation officer is reasonable if it is actuated by the legitimate operation of the probation supervision process and the probation officer acts reasonably in performing those duties. Austin v. State, 148 Ga. App. 784, 252 S.E.2d 696 (1979), overruled on other grounds, State v. Thackston, 289 Ga. 412, 716 S.E.2d 517 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">After the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation, the court could not impose the maximum sentence without giving the defendant credit for time served on probation since to do so would impose a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed by law.

<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Deduction of probation served from subsequent imprisonment.</b> - One serving sentence on probation is fulfilling sentence as effectually as if confined in jail or on chain gang, and accordingly, if after a hearing the order granting such probation is revoked, the time served by the defendant before the revocation must be counted in the defendant's favor and deducted from the period of service imposed. Roper v. Mallard, 193 Ga. 684, 19 S.E.2d 525 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of judge to suspend or probate sentence.</b> - Judge imposing sentence is granted power to suspend or probate the sentence under such rules and regulations as the judge thinks proper. Cross v. Huff, 208 Ga. 392, 67 S.E.2d 124 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judge has the right and authority to revoke the suspension or probation, after notice and a hearing, when the defendant violates any of the rules and regulations prescribed by the court. Simmons v. State, 96 Ga. App. 718, 101 S.E.2d 111 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice and hearing required for revocation.</b> - When a probation sentence is given, the trial judge is without authority to reserve the right to revoke the sentence without notice or hearing. Balkcom v. Gunn, 206 Ga. 167, 56 S.E.2d 482 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judge has the right and authority to revoke suspension or probation, after notice and a hearing, when the defendant violates any of the rules and regulations prescribed by the court. Cross v. Huff, 208 Ga. 392, 67 S.E.2d 124 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation of prescribed rules required for incarceration.</b> - When no rules or regulations are prescribed, and no violation of a prescribed rule or regulation is alleged, the court is without authority to order the defendant incarcerated upon the theory that one has violated the terms and conditions of a probation sentence. Cross v. Huff, 208 Ga. 392, 67 S.E.2d 124 (1951); Simmons v. State, 96 Ga. App. 718, 101 S.E.2d 111 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b>2. Decisions Under Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 27-2705</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to hearing.</b> - Probationer has right to notice and hearing upon question of revocation, and an order of revocation without a hearing is void. Roberts v. Lowry, 160 Ga. 494, 128 S.E. 746 (1925).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirement of and meaning of "due examination."</b> - It was general practice in Georgia for a warrant to be issued by a court on a written petition calling to the court's attention the alleged delinquency of a probationer, but the only requirement was that the defendant receive "due examination," which means that the defendant be given notice and an opportunity to be heard, and there being no requirement that the proceeding be initiated by written petition of the solicitor general (now district attorney), technical defects in such a petition when filed would not vitiate the warrant issued by the court or subsequent proceedings thereon, provided the requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard are complied with. Jackson v. State, 91 Ga. App. 291, 85 S.E.2d 444 (1954), overruled on other grounds, Jackson v. Jones, 254 Ga. 127, 327 S.E.2d 206 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of deprivation of liberty without giving notice and hearing.</b> - To deprive a defendant of the defendant's liberty upon the theory that the defendant has violated any of the rules and regulations prescribed in a suspended or probated sentence without giving the defendant notice and opportunity to be heard upon the question of whether or not the defendant has violated such rules and regulations, would violate one of the fundamental tenets that a person shall not be deprived of the defendant's liberty without due process of law, which includes notice and an opportunity to be heard. Lester v. Foster, 207 Ga. 596, 63 S.E.2d 402 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Review of revocation by appeals court.</b> - When, after due examination, the court revokes the court's order to the probationer to serve the remainder of the probationer's sentence outside the confines of the chain gang, jail, or other place of detention, Court of Appeals will not interfere unless a manifest abuse of discretion on the part of the lower court appears. Brown v. State, 71 Ga. App. 303, 30 S.E.2d 783 (1944). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court of Appeals will not interfere unless a manifest abuse of discretion appears. Waters v. State, 80 Ga. App. 104, 55 S.E.2d 677 (1949); Bryant v. State, 89 Ga. App. 891, 81 S.E.2d 556 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of judge.</b> - Discretion of the judge in revoking probation will not be interfered with unless grossly abused. Olsen v. State, 21 Ga. App. 795, 95 S.E. 269 (1918); Towns v. State, 25 Ga. App. 419, 103 S.E. 724 (1920). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judge is the trier of the facts in a case for the revocation of probation and has very wide discretion and unless a manifest abuse of such discretion on the part of the lower court appears, the appellate court will not interfere. Alewine v. State, 79 Ga. App. 779, 54 S.E.2d 507 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Leaving jurisdiction of court is ground for revocation.</b> See Shamblin v. Penn, 148 Ga. 592, 97 S.E. 520 (1918).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Quantum of evidence needed to revoke probation.</b> - Degree of evidence necessary to convict in a criminal case being that which convinces the jury of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and the degree necessary to support the revocation of a probation sentence being only some evidence that the defendant has violated the conditions of the probation, which satisfies the trial court hearing the case in the exercise of a very wide discretion - it is not necessary to show that the defendant has been convicted of the act constituting the condition of the probation; the sole issue before the trial court is that of whether or not the defendant has committed the act. Bryant v. State, 89 Ga. App. 891, 81 S.E.2d 556 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standard of certainty for establishing violation of conditions.</b> - Violation of the conditions of probation must be established with reasonable certainty so as to satisfy the conscience of the court of the truth of the violation. It does not have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In such a hearing if the evidence inclines a reasonable and impartial mind to the belief that the defendant violated the terms of the defendant's probation, it is sufficient. Sparks v. State, 77 Ga. App. 22, 47 S.E.2d 678 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation of probation condition determinative for revocation.</b> - It is not the record of conviction, but the fact of guilt of violation of a condition of probation, which determines whether probation should be revoked, and in determining this question the trial judge is not bound by the same rules of evidence as a jury in passing upon the guilt or innocence of the accused in the first instance. It is not necessary that the evidence support the finding beyond a reasonable doubt or even by a preponderance of the evidence; the judge is the trier of the facts, and the judge has a very wide discretion. Bryant v. State, 89 Ga. App. 891, 81 S.E.2d 556 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge conducting proceeding personally.</b> - It is not improper for the trial judge to issue an order or warrant for the arrest of the probationer and to conduct the proceeding personally. Waters v. State, 80 Ga. App. 104, 55 S.E.2d 677 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When presumption of proper notice and opportunity to be heard invoked.</b> - When a probationer is arrested on an order of the trial court directing that the probationer be placed in custody until a given date and then brought before the court for examination to determine the issue of whether or not the probationer's probation shall be revoked, and such probationer is brought before the court under arrest at the time and place specified, and counsel for the probationer also appears and represents the probationer at the hearing, it will be presumed that the probationer had proper notice and ample opportunity to be heard, it not appearing that counsel made any motion for a continuance to allow additional time to prepare the defense. Waters v. State, 80 Ga. App. 104, 55 S.E.2d 677 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Quantum of evidence necessary for revocation.</b> - Under the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2705, the examination of the defendant to determine whether the defendant has violated the conditions of the defendant's probation is conducted by the court without a jury, and the quantum of evidence necessary to convince the court that a criminal act authorizing revocation has been committed is different from that on a trial of the defendant for such offense under an indictment charging the defendant therewith. Price v. State, 91 Ga. App. 381, 85 S.E.2d 627 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probationer entitled to fair treatment.</b> - While probation is matter of grace, probationer is entitled to fair treatment and not to be made the victim of baseless impression or caprice. Sparks v. State, 77 Ga. App. 22, 47 S.E.2d 678 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect on defendant's sentence of not prescribing rules and regulations.</b> - To deprive a defendant of the defendant's liberty upon the theory that the defendant has violated rules and regulations prescribed in the defendant's sentence, when no rules, regulations, conditions, limitations, or restrictions were imposed by such sentence, would deprive the defendant of "due process of law." Cross v. Huff, 208 Ga. 392, 67 S.E.2d 124 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sentence held to be too vague.</b> - When sentence on charge of abandonment did not specify whether payments required were in the nature of fine or as payments for the support of the defendant's child or children, and failed to specify where or to whom the payments were to be made, this provision of the sentence was too vague and indefinite to be enforceable, and a revocation of the probation sentence solely on the ground that the defendant did not make the payments specified was without authority of law. Guest v. State, 87 Ga. App. 184, 73 S.E.2d 218 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ambiguous sentence construed in favor of defendant.</b> - Sentence which is, in its entirety, ambiguous and doubtful should be given that construction which favors the liberty of the individual; sentences in criminal cases to be strictly construed, and, on a hearing of an issue made by motion to revoke a probation sentence on the theory that certain rules and regulations prescribed therein have been violated, it must appear that the rules were in fact prescribed with definiteness and certainty in the sentence, and that there has been an infraction thereof, since to deprive the prisoner of the defendant's liberty otherwise would be a violation of due process. Guest v. State, 87 Ga. App. 184, 73 S.E.2d 218 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refusal to discharge upon habeas corpus not error.</b> - Since the original probation was void, it was not error to refuse to discharge defendant upon writ of habeas corpus. Shamblin v. Penn, 148 Ga. 592, 97 S.E. 520 (1918); Roberts v. Lowry, 160 Ga. 494, 128 S.E. 746 (1925).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation order not final judgment.</b> - Order revoking probationer's parole was not such a final judgment as was subject to review under Art. 2, Ch. 6, T. 5. Antonopoulas v. State, 151 Ga. 466, 107 S.E. 156 (1921); Troup v. State, 27 Ga. App. 636, 109 S.E. 681 (1921); Jackson v. State, 27 Ga. App. 648, 110 S.E. 423 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where hearing held.</b> - Probation violator may be returned to sentencing court for hearing or the violator may have hearing in court of equivalent original criminal jurisdiction within county wherein probationer resides for purposes of supervision upon the giving of ten days' written notice to the sentencing court prior to the hearing on the merits. 1965-66 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-257.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Fingerprinting of offenders.</b> - This offense is one for which those charged with a violation are to be fingerprinted. 1996 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 96-17. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Offense under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-38 requires fingerprinting only in those instances in which an adverse action is taken against the probationer such that the adverse action actually alters the terms of his or her probation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1998 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 80-79.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation committed subsequent to imposition of sentence.</b> - Probated sentence may be revoked if the sentence being revoked is in effect and being served at the time the order of revocation is made, even if the act constituting the violation was committed prior to the commencement of service of the probated sentence; provided that the violation was committed subsequent to the imposition of sentence. 1974 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance into state penal system.</b> - Once a court revokes probation and orders serving of sentence, the clerk sends notice to Board of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) and the state has an obligation to accept such persons into the state penal system. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-33.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Issuance of warrant against probationer.</b> - Issuance of warrant against person serving probated sentence does not stop running of time of the probated sentence; if probated sentence is revoked pursuant to the provisions for a hearing and judicial determination as set forth by this section, then the length of time to be served on the original sentence shall be time of sentence remaining after deduction is made for time which the probationer served under probation. 1967 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Crediting time served outside prison upon revocation.</b> - This section does not mean that in every case when probation is revoked, without more, the prisoner is not to receive credit for the time served outside the confines of the jail or prison, but it was the intention of the General Assembly that the judge revoking probation have the power to either give or deny such credit; it, therefore, is necessary to refer to the language of the order revoking probation. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 201.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Crediting confinement period after revocation.</b> - After revocation of probated sentence, in determining remaining balance of the sentence, the defendant is credited with the time on probation; however, to prevent the defendant from receiving double credit for this time, jail time credit should not be awarded toward the period of confinement ordered after revocation of a probated sentence. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ambiguous orders granting credit to be construed in prisoner's favor.</b> - When order revoking probation is ambiguous with respect to whether prisoner should or should not receive credit for time served outside prison, it would be necessary to give credit for such time, under the rulings that an order of probation, and the order revoking the probation, is a part of the sentence and in cases of ambiguity, a sentence is to be construed so as to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused. 1957 Op.

<p class="p11"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Comparison to other sections.</b> - Ga. L. 1965, p. 413, <span class="s1">§</span> 4 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-39) dealt with the effect of suspended sentences while former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 27-2502 and 27-2506.1 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 17-10-1 and 17-10-4) dealt with authority to impose the sentences. Cross v. State, 128 Ga. App. 774, 197 S.E.2d 853 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authorized conditions.</b> - Condition which would be authorized in the case of a probated sentence would be authorized in the case of a suspended sentence. Falkenhainer v. State, 122 Ga. App. 478, 177 S.E.2d 380 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of amendment.</b> - This section was amended to specify that suspended sentences not come under this article, but it did not provide any change allowing the court to suspend sentences. Cross v. State, 128 Ga. App. 774, 197 S.E.2d 853 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suspension upon condition did not amount to probation.</b> - Suspension of a convicted drunk driver's sentence upon condition that the driver not drive for 120 days did not have the effect of placing the driver on probation since the driver's driver's license was automatically suspended for 120 days. Williams v. State, 191 Ga. App. 217, 381 S.E.2d 399 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinguishing length of service for suspended and probated sentences.</b> - Court may, at the time of sentencing, specify the amount to be paid by the parent for the support of the minor child and may suspend the service of the sentence pending the minority of the child. When the child reaches majority, the sentence of course is at an end. However, service of any sentence so suspended in abandonment cases may be ordered at any time before the child reaches the age of 21. However, when a sentence is merely probated, the probationary feature of the sentence ends when the elapsed time equals the maximum sentence of confinement which could have been imposed. Entrekin v. State, 147 Ga. App. 724, 250 S.E.2d 177 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Abuse of discretion by court.</b> - Trial court abuses the court's discretion when the court places a case on the dead docket over the defendant's objection. Newman v. State, 121 Ga. App. 692, 175 S.E.2d 144 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Running of suspended sentence conditioned on payment of fine.</b> - Suspended sentence conditioned on payment of fine does not begin to run if fine is not paid until state or defendant initiates action to have suspension revoked. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-42.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of suspension of part of sentence.</b> - In the imposition of a sentence, if the trial court suspends service of part of sentence, the provision for suspension shall not have the effect of placing the defendant on probation; thus, once a probated sentence is revoked and the probationer has been sentenced to a definite period of years of imprisonment and the remainder of the defendant's sentence has been suspended, this sentence does not have the effect of placing the defendant on probation and, therefore, such sentence cannot be revoked. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-165.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Modification of original sentence upon probation.</b> - When a prisoner is placed on probation, the original sentence is subject to modification by the rendering court at any time during the period of probation; the judge imposing sentence is granted the power and authority to revoke suspension or probation when the defendant has violated any of the rules or regulations prescribed by the court. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-165.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to verbatim copy of presentence report.</b> - Defendant has no constitutional right to a verbatim copy of the presentence investigation report for use in sentence review process. Hence, this section is not unconstitutional on the ground the statute prohibits a defendant from obtaining access to the report. Mills v. State, 244 Ga. 186, 259 S.E.2d 445 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to compulsory process.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-40 unconstitutionally limited a criminal defendant's constitutional right to compulsory process when the statute was applied to prevent the defendant obtaining a copy of the results of a drug test in order to put forth a defense in a criminal trial.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revealing presentence report to counsel.</b> - If a presentence probation report contains any matter adverse to the defendant and likely to influence the decision to suspend or probate the sentence, it should be revealed to defense counsel by the trial judge in advance of the presentence hearing to give the accused an opportunity for explanation or rebuttal. Benefield v. State, 140 Ga. App. 727, 232 S.E.2d 89 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refreshing recollection with confidential presentence investigation report.</b> - In a proceeding to terminate the parental rights of a father who had been convicted of molesting his children, the trial court did not err in allowing a probation official to use a confidential presentence investigation report to refresh his recollection about interviews he had with the father. In re S.M.L., 228 Ga. App. 81, 491 S.E.2d 186 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>General Assembly intended first offender probation sentence to be preliminary only,</b> and, if completed without violation, permits the offender complete rehabilitation without the stigma of a felony conviction. Stephens v. State, 152 Ga. App. 591, 263 S.E.2d 477 (1979), rev'd on other grounds, 245 Ga. 835, 268 S.E.2d 330 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of 1982 amendment.</b> - The 1982 amendment of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 is applicable only as to those defendants who committed their crime on or after November 1, 1982. Hahn v. State, 166 Ga. App. 71, 303 S.E.2d 299 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Sentencing of a defendant first offender to a term of confinement under the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60, as amended effective November 1, 1982, for a crime committed on September 22, 1982, violated the ex post facto prohibition of the United States Constitution, when the law at the time of the commission of the crime contained no provision for a term of confinement. Taylor v. State, 181 Ga. App. 199, 351 S.E.2d 723 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First-offender treatment by consent, prior to 1982 amendment.</b> - Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 did not specifically provide for confinement as a condition of first-offender treatment before the 1982 amendment, when a condition of confinement was consented to by the defendant at the time the defendant's first-offender treatment was imposed and when no adjudication of guilt was entered at that time, the defendant's treatment was first-offender treatment even though ordered before the amendment, and the trial court did not err in revoking the first-offender treatment, entering an adjudication of guilt, and imposing a sentence which was harsher than the terms originally imposed. O'Ree v. State, 172 Ga. App. 51, 322 S.E.2d 89 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prior conviction under First Offender Act counts in calculation of criminal history.</b> - Because the defendant, who was discharged without adjudication of guilt under the Georgia First Offender Act (GFOA), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., after successfully completing probation, was not entitled to expungement of records, defendant's prior drug conviction under the GFOA was not expunged and the district court properly included that conviction in the calculation of the defendant's criminal history category pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual <span class="s1">§</span> 4A1.2 and properly sentenced the defendant to 21 months in prison for violating 21 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C).

<p class="p4"><b>Construction with O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>17-10-1. - Trial court did not err by sentencing the defendant to both confinement and probation in violation of the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(a), as the statute did not mandate a sentence of either confinement or probation, and the defendant's probation was not conditioned upon the defendant spending some specified time incarcerated; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-1(a)(1) granted to the sentencing judge the power and authority to suspend or probate all or any part of the entire sentence under such rules and regulations as the judge deems proper.

Burchette v. State, 274 Ga. App. 873, 619 S.E.2d 323 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with other statutes.</b> - State's claim that the defendant's sentence was not subject to review because the sentence followed a probation revocation was rejected as the defendant initially was sentenced as a First Offender; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., the sentence was revoked and a sentence of 12 or more years was imposed. State v. Swartz, 277 Ga. App. 241, 626 S.E.2d 210 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court abused the court's discretion in not even considering the defendant's request for first-offender sentencing, based on the court's inflexible rule that the court did not consider first-offender sentencing when a defendant went to trial and the court's belief that the defendant should have testified; even though the trial court was not required to grant first-offender status, the court was required to at least consider defendant's request. Wnek v. State, 262 Ga. App. 733, 586 S.E.2d 428 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence found based on DNA match did not violate Fourth Amendment.</b> - Evidence produced after a comparison of DNA from a robbery scene to a Georgia Bureau of Investigation database did not violate the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights because the sample was taken pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 35-3-160(b) and 35-3-165(b), while the defendant was serving a sentence under Georgia's First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60, and the match was made when the defendant was on probation with a reduced expectation of privacy.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Registration as special condition of probation.</b> - Trial court did not err in imposing a special requirement on defendant's probation of registration as a sex offender, even though the defendant was sentenced under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., as the imposition of that special condition was authorized under the language in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a) and to rule otherwise would render meaningless the language in <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a) concerning registration requirements.

<p class="p4"><b>Confinement not "incarceration."</b> Sentence of defendant based on first offender treatment, to five years' probation, conditioned upon successive periods of confinement in a detention center, a diversion center, and in defendant's house under intensive supervision, was authorized and as such does not constitute incarceration, which refers to continuous and uninterrupted custody in a jail or penitentiary.

<p class="p4"><b>First offender treatment is "conviction" under Immigration and Nationality Act.</b> - Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) did not abuse the Board's discretion when the Board denied the alien's motion to reopen because: (1) the alien pled guilty to two counts of child molestation and received five years probation on each count, thereby satisfying the requirements of 8 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1101(a)(48)(A), and the mere fact that the alien was sentenced pursuant to Georgia's First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(a) did not mean that the alien lacked a "conviction" for purposes of 8 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1227; (2) nothing in the alien's extraordinary motion for a new trial, the state's nolle prosse motion, or the superior court's orders indicated that the alien's guilty plea was taken in violation of Georgia law or the federal constitution; (3) although it was uncontroverted that a full and unconditional pardon would have defeated the charge that the alien was removable under 8 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the BIA did not abuse the Board's discretion when the Board refused to consider the alien's uncertified copy of the alien's pardon; and (4) even if the BIA had considered the alien's pardon, the pardon would not have eliminated the additional grounds for removal that the alien conceded to at the removal hearing.

<p class="p4"><b>Guilty plea not a "conviction."</b> - Entry of a guilty plea under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 is not a "conviction" within the usual definition of that term. Priest v. State, 261 Ga. 651, 409 S.E.2d 657 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p9"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provisions not applicable to DUI cases.</b> - Phrase "relating to probation of first offenders" in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-391(f) refers to the general title of O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 8, T. 42, and does not purport to limit the prohibition of first offender treatment only to convictions for driving under the influence when probation is imposed. Sims v. State, 214 Ga. App. 443, 448 S.E.2d 77 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-391(f) did not violate equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment or Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. II by excluding DUI offenses from First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., coverage. The defendant did not show the absence of a rational relationship between the state's compelling interest in protecting the public's safety and the classification; the defendant's equal protection argument boiled down to no more than the claim that the legislature made a bad policy judgment about which offenders should be eligible for First Offender Act treatment. Rhodes v. State, 283 Ga. 361, 659 S.E.2d 370 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of motion to withdraw guilty plea.</b> - Since judgments of conviction are not entered in cases proceeding under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., unless the defendant violates the terms of probation, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction both for resentencing and to consider a motion to withdraw a guilty plea after the end of the term of court in which the plea was entered. Tripp v. State, 223 Ga. App. 73, 476 S.E.2d 844 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First-offender petition.</b> - Defendant's first-offender petition filed after the verdict was returned but before the court entered the sentence was timely. Fleming v. State, 233 Ga. App. 483, 504 S.E.2d 542 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First-offender status is discretionary.</b> - Trial court in rendering sentence is not required to give first-offender status merely because it is requested, even if no previous offense is shown; but according to the circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the individual defendant in the crime, the trial court may give in the court's discretion any sentence prescribed by law for the offense. Welborn v. State, 166 Ga. App. 214, 303 S.E.2d 755 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court is not required to render a first offender status merely because it is requested even when no previous offense is shown; the trial court may give in the court's discretion any sentence prescribed by law for an offense, or probation. Todd v. State, 172 Ga. App. 231, 323 S.E.2d 6 (1984); Head v. State, 203 Ga. App. 730, 417 S.E.2d 398 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by refusing to grant defendant first offender treatment because the defendant committed a misdemeanor after the offense for which he sought first offender treatment. Stinnett v. State, 215 Ga. App. 224, 447 S.E.2d 165 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Following technical violations of the conditions of probation, short of conviction for another crime or a determination of initial ineligibility, the trial court had discretion to continue a first offender on probation without first revoking first offender status, entering an adjudication of guilt, and resentencing for the underlying offense. Mohammed v. State, 226 Ga. App. 387, 486 S.E.2d 652 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Nothing in Georgia's First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., required the trial court sua sponte to consider defendant's status as a first offender, and the trial court did not err by adopting a sentence that was consistent with the sentence the prosecutor agreed to recommend if the defendant pled guilty to robbery by intimidation. Gibson v. State, 257 Ga. App. 134, 570 S.E.2d 437 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not fail to exercise the court's discretion in considering and then denying the defendant's request for first offender treatment with regard to the defendant's conviction upon a non-negotiated guilty plea for aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime because the record showed that the trial judge considered the request and determined that, given the nature of the offense, it would be inappropriate to grant such status. Steele v. State, 270 Ga. App. 488, 606 S.E.2d 664 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by failing to sentence the defendant as a first offender because although the defendant did not request first offender treatment, it was apparent from the record that the trial court knew of the defendant's lack of criminal convictions but nevertheless sentenced the defendant to 30 years, to serve 10, and 20 years consecutive on probation. Freeman v. State, 328 Ga. App. 756, 760 S.E.2d 708 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court has discretion.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's request for first offender treatment, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60, because the trial court's remarks during sentencing did not indicate a lack of awareness that the court had the discretion, was not applying a mechanical policy that prevented proper consideration of the request, or that there was an outright refusal to consider the request. McCullough v. State, 317 Ga. App. 853, 733 S.E.2d 36 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly declined to grant appellant first offender treatment under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 on all the crimes in the four separate charging instruments to which the offender pled guilty because when the first judgment was entered, the offender had benefitted from first offender treatment on a verdict or plea and could not do so again. Higdon v. State, 291 Ga. 821, 733 S.E.2d 750 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First offender status does not mandate probationary period.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(a), a trial court may place a first offender defendant on probation or sentence the defendant to a term of confinement as provided by law and nothing in the statute mandates a probationary period for first offenders; on the contrary, a trial court exercises the court's discretion in determining whether to grant probation to a first offender. Therefore, the defendant, who was sentenced as recommended by the plea agreement, properly had the defendant's motion to correct sentence denied. Wilson v. State, 259 Ga. App. 627, 578 S.E.2d 260 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consideration of first offender status mandatory.</b> - Trial court's use of a mechanical sentencing formula or policy whereby first offender status consideration was automatically refused violated O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60. Jones v. State, 208 Ga. App. 472, 431 S.E.2d 136 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court violated O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(a) by failing to exercise the court's discretion and refusing to consider sentencing defendant as a first offender because the defendant opted for a jury trial; the use of a mechanical sentencing formula was an abdication of judicial responsibility. Cook v. State, 256 Ga. App. 353, 568 S.E.2d 482 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's sentence for numerous threat, obstruction, and fleeing convictions could not stand since the trial court abdicated the court's judicial responsibility by adopting an inflexible rule in not hearing the defendant's oral motion for first offender treatment. Ramage v. State, 259 Ga. App. 616, 578 S.E.2d 245 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellate court discerned no basis for reconsideration of the defendant's sentence because there was no clear and unambiguous statement showing that the trial court failed to exercise the court's discretion in denying the request for first offender status. Garr v. State, 347 Ga. App. 555, 820 S.E.2d 193 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere reminder insufficient to request sentencing under first offender act.</b> - Merely reminding the sentencing judge that the conviction is the defendant's first offense is not equivalent to a request for sentencing under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq. Powell v. State, 271 Ga. App. 550, 610 S.E.2d 178 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney must request first offender treatment.</b> - Defendant's 10-year sentence for forgery was affirmed as the defendant attorney twice reminded the sentencing court of defendant's first offender status, but did not request that the defendant be sentenced under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60; absent clear, i.e., unambiguous, statements in the record showing: (1) an explicit request for First Offender Act treatment at the time of sentencing; and (2) a failure to exercise discretion as evidenced by a misunderstanding of the law or a general policy against First Offender Act treatment, a defendant's sentence must be upheld. Powell v. State, 271 Ga. App. 550, 610 S.E.2d 178 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court was authorized to consider the defendant's indifference to both the terms of the bond requirements imposed and the underlying charges filed in the court's decision regarding whether or not to treat the defendant as a first offender; hence, the court did not err in declining to impose sentence under the first offender statute. Collins v. State, 281 Ga. App. 240, 636 S.E.2d 32 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First offender treatment may not be granted after defendant has been sentenced.</b> Lewis v. State, 217 Ga. App. 758, 458 S.E.2d 861 (1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After the defendant was found guilty of arson and sentenced for that offense, the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(a) barred a trial court from considering the defendant's motion to be granted first offender treatment. Burchette v. State, 274 Ga. App. 873, 619 S.E.2d 323 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After a defendant was convicted for statutory rape, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to resentence the defendant as a first offender or to rescind the conviction or confinement portion of the sentence. First offender treatment was only permitted before a defendant had been adjudicated guilty and sentenced. State v. Stulb, 296 Ga. App. 510, 675 S.E.2d 253 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court lacked jurisdiction to resentence the defendant under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., as the trial court resentenced the defendant as a first offender long after entering the court's final judgment on the felony conviction and sentencing the defendant, and the trial court was not at liberty to unwind the clock and modify the final judgment of conviction and sentence in order to grant first offender treatment and the court's attempt to do so was a mere nullity. State v. Spain, 332 Ga. App. 412, 773 S.E.2d 281 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Out of state conviction.</b> - Trial court did not err by denying defendant first-offender treatment as defendant presented no evidence, in the form of a certified copy of the conviction in another state in which defendant was sentenced to a one-year term of probation, that the prior conviction in the other state was a misdemeanor. Middleton v. State, 264 Ga. App. 615, 591 S.E.2d 493 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First offender status application to misdemeanors.</b> - In a felony case where defendant's first offender status was removed from the sentence defendant received for pleading guilty to theft by receiving a stolen motor vehicle because defendant had previously pled guilty to a misdemeanor, the appellate court held that the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., applied to misdemeanors. Stafford v. State, 251 Ga. App. 203, 554 S.E.2d 219 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prior prosecution in which defendant given first offender treatment.</b> - As a result of the changes made in 1985 to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60, the use of a prior prosecution in which the defendant was given first offender treatment and successfully completed the terms of the defendant's probated sentence "is not allowable by law" as provided in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-65. Accordingly, the portion of the case in which the defendant was sentenced under subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-7 as a repeat offender had to be reversed and remanded for resentencing. Queen v. State, 182 Ga. App. 794, 357 S.E.2d 150 (1987) (holding Op. Att'y Gen. U81-32 incorrectly states present law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Expungement upon completion of probation</b> of the records of first offender treatment of criminal defendants runs contrary to the intent and the practical operation of the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq. State v. C.S.B., 250 Ga. 261, 297 S.E.2d 260 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impeachment of witness in civil trial with first offender status.</b> - Notwithstanding the fact that a conviction does not result unless the person sentenced fails to complete satisfactorily the probationary period, the record of a first offender sentence may be used to impeach a witness in a civil action. Hightower v. GMC, 175 Ga. App. 112, 332 S.E.2d 336 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Pender v. Witcher, 196 Ga. App. 856, 397 S.E.2d 193 (1990), aff'd, 255 Ga. 349, 338 S.E.2d 426 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consideration for plea agreement.</b> - Granting first offender treatment to the defendant for crimes for which the defendant could have been barred from seeking office for ten years constituted consideration for a plea agreement. State v. Barrett, 215 Ga. App. 401, 451 S.E.2d 82 (1994), rev'd on other grounds, 265 Ga. 489, 458 S.E.2d 620 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Opportunity for rehabilitation.</b> - If an offender does not take advantage of an opportunity for rehabilitation, the offender's trial which has been suspended is continued and an adjudication of guilt is made and a sentence entered. State v. Wiley, 233 Ga. 316, 210 S.E.2d 790 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If, by violating the terms of the defendant's probation, the defendant shows that the defendant is not worthy of the offered opportunity for rehabilitation then, and only then is the defendant sentenced to the penitentiary. No former adjudication of guilt having been made and no prior sentence having been entered thereon, the defendant is subject to receive any sentence permitted by law for the offense the defendant has been found guilty of committing. State v. Wiley, 233 Ga. 316, 210 S.E.2d 790 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Type of evidence necessary to support revocation.</b> - Certified copy of a criminal conviction constitutes sufficient evidence of a violation of the stated term of probation. Crawford v. State, 166 Ga. App. 272, 304 S.E.2d 443 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Better practice would be to introduce evidence of the criminal offense underlying the conviction as well as a certified copy of the conviction itself. If that is done, the fact that the conviction is reversed on appeal because of error, or because the evidence does not support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, will not vitiate a revocation of probation properly based on slight evidence of the criminal offense.

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant informed of consequences if probation violated.</b> - Trial court did not err in increasing the sentence originally imposed upon the defendant because the defendant was informed when the first offender probation sentence was pronounced that, upon an adjudication of guilt, the defendant could be sentenced to the maximum allowable under the law; although the sentencing form was ambiguous since both the first offender treatment box and the felony sentence box were checked, the ambiguity in the form was not fatal to the trial court's imposition of a sentence greater than the original one.

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probation sentence merely preliminary.</b> - Any probationary sentence entered under this section is preliminary only, and, if completed without violation, permits an offender complete rehabilitation without the stigma of a felony conviction. If, however, such offender does not take advantage of such opportunity for rehabilitation, the offender's trial which, in effect, has been suspended is continued and an adjudication of guilt is made and a sentence entered. State v. Wiley, 233 Ga. 316, 210 S.E.2d 790 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restrictions may be imposed during service of first offender term.</b> - Subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62 allows a defendant's slate to be wiped clean for the purposes of recordation of a criminal conviction and its effect on civil rights or liberties after a defendant successfully fulfills the first offender terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It does not prohibit restrictions on a defendant's civil rights or liberties imposed during service of the first offender term. Salomon v. Earp, 190 Ga. App. 405, 379 S.E.2d 217 (1989), overruled on other grounds, Pender v. Witcher, 196 Ga. App. 856, 397 S.E.2d 193 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Necessity of adjudication of guilt.</b> - Despite the defendant's two violations of the conditions of probation, because no adjudication of guilt was entered during the term of the defendant's first offender probationary sentence, upon fulfillment of the probationary period, the defendant was entitled to discharge without an adjudication of guilt under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a). Ailara v. State, 311 Ga. App. 862, 717 S.E.2d 498 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First-offender prohibited from obtaining pistol permit.</b> - Provision of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-11-129(b), prohibiting the granting of a pistol permit to a person convicted as a first-offender for possession of a controlled substance, applied prospectively to an applicant who had been discharged as a first-offender five years before enactment of the provision. Foss v. Probate Court of Chatham County, 232 Ga. App. 612, 502 S.E.2d 278 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Discharge" automatic upon completion of term.</b> - "Discharge" of a non-first-offender probationer is automatic upon the successful completion of the terms of the sentence and is not dependent upon the subsequent formalization of that successful completion. State v. Mills, 268 Ga. 873, 495 S.E.2d 1 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After the defendant was sentenced under O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 8, T. 42 to five years of probation on one count, followed by five consecutive 12 month sentences on other counts, the defendant was entitled to have the defendant's record cleared of the first count under O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 8, T. 42 after completing the defendant's first five years of probation. Arrington v. State, 234 Ga. App. 187, 505 S.E.2d 851 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a), was not automatically discharged under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60, when the defendant was released from confinement because the automatic discharge of the defendant occurred upon the successful completion of the terms of the defendant's sentence. Kaylor v. State, 312 Ga. App. 633, 719 S.E.2d 530 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Regardless of whether mandamus was an appropriate remedy, the inmate was entitled to have the record properly reflect the inmate's discharge under the First Offender Act because the inmate's discharge was automatic upon the inmate's release from confinement and not upon any formalized certification by the trial court. Because the trial court had neither revoked the inmate's first-offender status nor entered an adjudication of guilt, the inmate was discharged upon the inmate's release from confinement in May 2001, and the clerk's records incorrectly represented that the inmate was discharged in December 2014 reflecting when the trial court's order was dated and filed. Seibert v. Alexander, 351 Ga. App. 446, 829 S.E.2d 473 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant's driver's license was properly suspended</b> after the defendant pled guilty to, and received sentences as a first offender for, two counts of homicide by vehicle in the first degree and one count of driving with ability impaired by alcohol. Salomon v. Earp, 190 Ga. App. 405, 379 S.E.2d 217 (1989), overruled on other grounds, Pender v. Witcher, 196 Ga. App. 856, 397 S.E.2d 193 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of prior prosecution in which defendant given first-offender treatment.</b> - As a result of the changes made in 1985 to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62, the use of a prior prosecution in which the defendant was given first offender treatment and successfully completed the terms of the defendant's probated sentence "is not allowable by law" as provided in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-65. Accordingly, the portion of the case in which the defendant was sentenced under subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-7 as a repeat offender had to be reversed and remanded for resentencing. Queen v. State, 182 Ga. App. 794, 357 S.E.2d 150 (1987) (holding Op. Att'y Gen. U81-32 incorrectly states present law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant had completed a three-year first-offender probationary sentence and had been discharged without court adjudication of guilt pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62 at the time the defendant allegedly violated O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-11-131, the trial court properly dismissed the charge. State v. Mills, 268 Ga. 873, 495 S.E.2d 1 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant, who was discharged without adjudication of guilt under the Georgia First Offender Act (GFOA) after successfully completing probation, was not entitled to expungement of records, defendant's prior drug conviction under the GFOA was not expunged and the district court properly included that conviction in the calculation of defendant's criminal history category pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual <span class="s1">§</span> 4A1.2 and properly sentenced the defendant to 21 months in prison for violating 21 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). United States v. Knight,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Nov. 15, 2005)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impeachment of witness through first-offender record.</b> - In both civil and criminal cases, unless there is an adjudication of guilt, a witness may not be impeached on general credibility grounds by evidence of a first offender record. Matthews v. State, 268 Ga. 798, 493 S.E.2d 136 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., the trial court properly prohibited a defendant from impeaching a witness with a forgery offense. The defendant cited no authority in support of the argument that this violated the defendant's rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, and the court held that impeachment to show a general lack of trustworthiness based on a prior criminal conviction was not guaranteed by the confrontation clause. Butler v. State, 285 Ga. 518, 678 S.E.2d 92 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility in civil actions.</b> - Evidence of a first offender's guilty plea is not admissible for the purpose of impeaching a witness by showing the witness to have been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, even though it is admissible in a civil trial to impeach an adverse witness by disproving or contradicting the witness's testimony. Witcher v. Pender, 260 Ga. 248, 392 S.E.2d 6 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Rehabilitation" within meaning of federal rule.</b> - Section did not provide for "rehabilitation" within the meaning of Rule 609(c), Fed. R. Evid., which prohibits evidence of a prior conviction for purposes of impeachment if the conviction has been the subject of a "rehabilitation." Wilson v. Attaway, 757 F.2d 1227 (11th Cir.), rehearing denied, 764 F.2d 1411 (11th Cir. 1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guilty plea under first-offender inadmissible.</b> - Trial court erred in admitting testimony and documents concerning defendant's entry of the first-offender guilty plea to commercial gambling since the defendant was still on probation at the time of the condemnation trial, and because it was not used for impeachment purposes, its use was prohibited. Jones v. State, 212 Ga. App. 682, 442 S.E.2d 880 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's guilty plea to an offense for which the defendant received first-offender treatment should not have been admitted as evidence that the defendant committed a similar independent offense. Davis v. State, 269 Ga. 276, 496 S.E.2d 699 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>First offender record properly admitted.</b> - Defendant's first offender record was properly considered at the defendant's sentencing hearing, and evidence regarding the defendant's underlying behavior in connection with the first offender plea was not required. Williams v. State, 228 Ga. App. 622, 492 S.E.2d 290 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in allowing the state to impeach the defendant's girlfriend using the girlfriend's first-offender plea because the state did not use the girlfriend's guilty plea to impeach the girlfriend's general credibility, but instead used it to show bias through evidence that the defendant had previously attempted to accept responsibility for the girlfriend's criminal conduct in a different matter, and the trial court acted well within the court's discretion in allowing the state to explore whether the defendant's previous attempt to accept responsibility for the girlfriend's criminal conduct might have influenced the girlfriend's trial testimony. Hall v. State, 335 Ga. App. 895, 783 S.E.2d 400 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Eligibility for jury duty.</b> - Prospective juror who had fulfilled probation requirements was eligible under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a) for jury duty in a criminal case. Griffith v. State, 286 Ga. App. 859, 650 S.E.2d 413 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sex offender registration as special condition to probation.</b> - Trial court did not err in imposing a special requirement on defendant's probation of registration as a sex offender, even though the defendant was sentenced under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60 et seq., as the imposition of that special condition was authorized under the language in <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a) and to rule otherwise would render meaningless the language in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a) concerning registration requirements. Evors v. State, 275 Ga. App. 345, 620 S.E.2d 596 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sex offender registration not required after successful completion of first offender sentence.</b> - Defendant was not required to register as a sexual offender because the defendant successfully completed a first-offender sentence for statutory rape and burglary charges, and a "conviction" under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-1-12(a)(8) did not include a discharge without an adjudication of guilt following the successful completion of a first offender sentence; the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-62(a) provided that, with certain exceptions, once a first offender was discharged without an adjudication of guilt, he or she stood completely exonerated and was not considered as having been convicted of a crime. Jackson v. State, 299 Ga. App. 356, 683 S.E.2d 60 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to challenge evidence of non-adjudicated crime was ineffective assistance of counsel.</b> - Defendant's convictions for armed robbery, aggravated assault, and kidnapping of a couple in a residence were reversed on appeal. Evidence that one victim was ordered from a standing to a lying position and that another was dragged around the home was insufficient to establish asportation to support the kidnapping counts. The defendant's convictions for armed robbery and aggravated assault were reversed as the defendant established ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel's failure to object to the inadmissible hearsay statements of two witnesses and the admission of improper impeachment evidence against the defendant regarding a crime for which the defendant was never adjudicated guilty for as a result of being a first offender. Rayshad v. State, 295 Ga. App. 29, 670 S.E.2d 849 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of exoneration and discharge was void.</b> - Trial court's 1998 sentencing order denying the defendant exoneration and discharge was void as a matter of law because the state never filed a motion for revocation; thus, exoneration and discharge was automatic under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(e), (g), and (h), and the defendant's motion to correct the void sentence was improperly denied.

<p class="p4"><b>Request for sealing of records denied.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's petition to seal records pursuant to the statute limiting public access to first offender records as the defendant's guilty plea to repeated violations of public trust in connection with the defendant's dental profession authorized the trial court to be inclined toward allowing the record to be available to the public.

<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for an order of exoneration and to restrict access to the defendant's criminal record because the sentencing form was not ambiguous as the form merely established that the defendant was either being adjudged guilty or sentenced as a first offender, not both, and the form indicated, in bold print, that the disposition of the charged offense was guilty; thus, the sentencing form clearly indicated that the defendant was convicted of the charged offense.

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - In a suit brought by misdemeanor defendants challenging the privatization of probation services under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-100(g)(1), the Georgia Supreme Court agreed with the trial court that <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-100(g)(1) was not unconstitutional on the statute's face and did not offend due process or equal protection nor condone imprisonment for debt.

<p class="p4">Requirement for payment of probation supervision fees by probationers to private probation services company did not violate the separation of powers since the imposition of the fees pursuant to contract constituted a civil fee for services, not a criminal punishment. Furthermore, the mere act of privatizing probation services did not violate the Georgia Constitution since a probation services company was not authorized to deprive probationers of property or liberty without due process, the private probation services were not fundamentally unfair, and the sentencing court continued to oversee the probation process.

<p class="p4"><b>Collection of electronic monitoring fees by private probation service.</b> - Trial court erred by finding that electronic monitoring fees imposed by the sentencing court and collected by a private probation service for monitoring services rendered during a probationer's original term of sentence were prohibited because only when electronic monitoring was unlawfully imposed by the court on a misdemeanor probationer after the expiration of the probationers' original sentence would such fees potentially be recoverable.

<p class="p9">In recognition of the doctrine contained in the Constitution of this state requiring the three branches of government to be separate, it is declared to be the policy of the General Assembly that the duties, powers, and functions of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles are executive in character and that, in the performance of its duties under this chapter, no other body is authorized to usurp or substitute its functions for the functions imposed by this chapter upon the board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Qualifications of members.</b> - Ga. Const. 1945, Art. V, Sec. I, Para XI enumerating powers and duties of the board does not make provision for, or reference to, qualifications of members of the board at the time of their appointment. The qualifications of members of the board would, therefore, be controlled by the general provisions of the Constitution and statutory laws limiting the rights of citizens to hold public office. McLendon v. Everett, 205 Ga. 713, 55 S.E.2d 119 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of compliance with law.</b> - While board may change the board's rules, there is presumption of law that members, being public officers, will discharge the members' duties and follow the statutory provisions which created the board. Thompson v. State, 203 Ga. 416, 47 S.E.2d 54 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Forfeiture of office.</b> - There is nothing in the statutory provisions, defining powers and duties of members of State Board of Pardons and Paroles, which provides that doing certain acts by a member would operate as a forfeiture of the member's office. Turner v. Wilburn, 206 Ga. 149, 56 S.E.2d 285 (1949). (But see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-9-12 and 42-9-13 for provisions regarding incapacity, etc.) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There being no statutory provision that a member of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles should forfeit the member's office if the member engaged in any other business or profession, or held any public office, during the member's service upon the board, quo warranto is not the proper remedy to determine whether or not there has been an act of forfeiture.

<p class="p11"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Control in board, not individuals.</b> - Management and control is vested in State Board of Pardons and Paroles and not in individual members, or in any one individual officer. In the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, when official authority is conferred upon the board or commission composed of three or more persons, such authority may be exercised by a majority of the members of the board, but it may not be exercised by a single member of such a board, or by a minority. 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 450.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Function of chair of board.</b> - Chair of the board is the proper parliamentary officer to preside at meetings of the board for the purpose of directing or regulating proceedings and seeing that meetings or hearings are conducted in an orderly manner. The chair of the board, however, by virtue of such office or of the chair's title, does not acquire authority to perform the powers and duties vested by the General Assembly in the State Board of Pardons and Paroles. 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 450.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Board's quasi-judicial functions retained.</b> - Except for supervision of parolees and assignment to the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) for administrative purposes only, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles retains the board's quasi-judicial functions and powers as a result of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1972 (Ga. L. 1972, p. 1015). 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-72.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assignment of staff by Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) to board.</b> - Since the State Board of Pardons and Paroles has statutory authority to hire the board's own personnel to assist in carrying out the board's quasi-judicial functions, the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) is not authorized to assign staff to the board as preparole investigators. 1975 Op.

The General Assembly might have provided that a member of the Democratic executive committee could not be appointed as a member of the board, and might have declared a member of the committee to be ineligible for appointment on the board. The legislature did not do this. The legislature provided that a member of the board should not serve as an executive officer or employee of any political committee. McLendon v.

<p class="p11"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Presence of "unfettered discretion" in the clemency process does not render the imposition of the death penalty on the defendant arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The discretion involved at the clemency stage can never cause the imposition of the death sentence; it serves only as an act of grace to relieve that sentence even when the sentence has been legally imposed. Smith v. Snow, 722 F.2d 630 (11th Cir. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One application intended as matter of right.</b> - It is the intent of the Constitution and this article that consideration and action upon one application for commutation by the board is all that the prisoner may demand as a matter of right. Whether or not a second application would be considered and acted upon by the board would be a matter for the board's discretion. McLendon v. Everett, 205 Ga. 713, 55 S.E.2d 119 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Instructing jury of possibility of parole of prisoner not erroneous.</b> - Defendant in a criminal case, upon conviction and after serving the defendant's minimum sentence, may be paroled to serve the remainder of the defendant's sentence outside the confines of the penitentiary and the court did not err in so instructing the jury at their request. Jones v. State, 88 Ga. App. 330, 76 S.E.2d 810 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of parole, as distinguished from revocation of parole,</b> does not amount to loss of liberty in the due process context. Jackson v. Reese, 608 F.2d 159 (5th Cir. 1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State supreme court vacated the trial court's judgment denying an inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus</b> challenging procedures used by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles when the Board revoked the inmate's parole because the recommendation submitted by the Board member who heard the allegations was not a part of the record and there was no evidence in the record which allowed the court to determine the basis of absent Board members' decisions to accept that recommendation and what procedures were followed in revoking the inmate's parole. Roberts v. Scroggy, 278 Ga. 25, 597 S.E.2d 385 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parole conditions.</b> - Trial court erred by requiring the defendant to waive the defendant's Fourth Amendment right as a condition of parole since "any attempt by a court to impose its will over the Executive Department by attempting to impose as a part of a criminal sentence conditions operating as a prerequisite of or becoming automatically effective in the event of a subsequent parole of defendant by the State Board of Pardons and Parole would be a nullity and constitute an exercise of power granted exclusively to the Executive." Stephens v. State, 207 Ga. App. 645, 428 S.E.2d 661 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying parolee's petition for writ of mandamus to lift parole conditions requiring electronic monitoring and that the parolee get sex offender counseling as the electronic monitoring condition had been lifted by the time the trial court held a hearing on that condition and the parole board did not act in an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable manner in imposing the counseling condition as the parolee's offenses, while they were not sexually violent offenses, had sexual overtones; thus, the parole board acted consistent with the board's primary goal of protecting society.

<p class="p4"><b>Confinement in prison system as prerequisite for parole.</b> - In order to be eligible for parole consideration, a person must be confined in a state penal institution; a person out on bond would not be eligible for parole consideration unless and until one is returned to confinement in the state prison system. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-97. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Board does not have jurisdiction to act upon this state's sentence so long as the individual concerned is incarcerated in a federal prison serving this state's sentence concurrently with a federal sentence; to be eligible for parole consideration, an individual must be confined in a state penal institution. 1972 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sentence tolled upon grant of reprieve for receipt of medical treatment.</b> - When a prisoner receives a reprieve of the prisoner's sentence for the purpose of receiving medical treatment, the prisoner's sentence does not run during the time the prisoner is outside the penitentiary. 1957 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Commuting sentence to present service.</b> - Board does have power to commute a sentence of imprisonment to present service upon condition that the prisoner pay a fine in the sum fixed within the law by the board, or upon such other conditions which are not illegal, immoral, or impossible of performance. 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 446.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reprieve defined.</b> - Reprieve is the withdrawing of any sentence for an interval of time; it does no more than stay the execution of the sentence for a period of time. It is the withdrawing of a sentence for an interval of time whereby the execution of the sentence is suspended; it is merely the postponement of the sentence for a time; it does not and cannot defeat the ultimate execution of the judgment of the court but merely delays it; it is a respite, a temporary suspension of the execution of a sentence; it is a delay. 1957 Op.

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with Georgia Street Gang and Terrorism Prevention Act.</b> - There is no legal authority to support the proposition that the Georgia Street Gang and Terrorism Prevention Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-15-1 et seq., and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-39, two very differently worded statutory provisions, are equivalent; thus, the defendant's argument that, as a matter of law, if the armed robbery of September 17, 1999, and the murder of December 28, 1999, are considered as part of the "pattern of criminal street gang activity" for purposes of violating the Street Gang Act, they must necessarily also be considered "offenses occurring in the same series of acts" within the meaning of <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-39(c) failed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of parole not necessarily cruel and unusual punishment.</b> - Since in pleading guilty to four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, the defendant admitted a number of acts that a jury could reasonably consider "aggravating circumstances" under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-30(b), and in both Georgia and other jurisdictions, the defendant might well have been sentenced to death, a sentence denying the defendant consideration of parole for 30 years, under subsection (c) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-39 does not constitute "cruel and unusual punishment."

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Juvenile offenders.</b> - Defendant's sentence for crimes the juvenile committed as a juvenile, which amounted to eight consecutive life sentences plus 60 years, was upheld on appeal because the United States Supreme Court had not expanded its mandate that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment as the Amendment applied to juvenile offenders required a sentencer to consider a juvenile's youth and youth's attendant characteristics before imposing a sentence other than life without parole.

<p class="p4"><b>Release is not mandated.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-42(c) must be read as a qualification of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-40, the provision requiring adoption of the parole guideline system. Although the legislature has required the Board of Pardon and Paroles to adopt a guideline system to be used as a framework for making more consistent parole decisions, it also preserved the Board's authority to use the Board's discretion in making final parole decisions. The statute and regulations, therefore, do not mandate that release be granted if the guidelines criteria is met. Sultenfuss v. Snow, 35 F.3d 1494 (11th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1191, 115 S. Ct. 1254, 131 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Role of board in denying parole.</b> - Plaintiff's contention that the Georgia Parole Board was not vested with the discretion to deny parole was specious in light of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-40.

<p class="p4"><b>Mandamus not available to compel change in parole date.</b> - Setting of a tentative parole month was a discretionary act of the state parole board and mandamus did not lie to compel the board to reinstate a former tentative date. Vargas v. Morris, 266 Ga. 141, 465 S.E.2d 275 (1996), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1108, 116 S. Ct. 1329, 134 L. Ed. 2d 480 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though the State Pardons and Paroles Board was required to adopt a parole guideline system on all inmates who would become eligible for parole, except for inmates serving life sentences, the board was not obligated to grant parole to a prisoner at the earliest date parole had to be considered as the issue of whether to grant parole was a discretionary matter entrusted to the board; thus, the prisoner's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel parole at an earlier time should have been denied.

<p class="p4"><b>Impact of parole officers and board's actions.</b> - Parole board was responsible for maintaining a complete record on any person who came under the power of the board and that record included the nature and term of the individual's sentence; furthermore, it was the parole board that has the power to set the terms and conditions of parole. Thus, the acts of the parole officer, or those within the parole board who make such determinations, in setting the expiration dates of plaintiff's parole, served to break the chain of causation with respect to any error that might have flowed from the misstatement in the parole officer's motion; the parole officer had no power to increase plaintiff's sentence and no power to set the terms of plaintiff's parole.

<p class="p11"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section constitutional.</b> - Presence of "unfettered discretion" in the clemency process does not render the imposition of the death penalty on the defendant arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The discretion involved at the clemency stage can never cause the imposition of the death sentence; it serves only as an act of grace to relieve that sentence even when the sentence has been legally imposed. Smith v. Snow, 722 F.2d 630 (11th Cir. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Instruction to jury.</b> - Defendant in a criminal case, upon conviction and after serving the defendant's minimum sentence, may be paroled to serve the remainder of the defendant's sentence outside the confines of the penitentiary and the court did not err in so instructing the jury at their request. Jones v. State, 88 Ga. App. 330, 76 S.E.2d 810 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Habeas court violated separation of powers by revoking sentence while petitioner in custody of parole board.</b> - Habeas court erred by revoking the petitioner's remaining portion of the original sentence while the petitioner was in the legal custody of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles as such action was in violation of the separation of powers provision of Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Para. III. Hayward v. Danforth, 299 Ga. 261, 787 S.E.2d 709 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Board control until expiration of maximum term.</b> - This section gives the board control over the prisoner until expiration of the prisoner's maximum term and power to revoke a parole and remand a parolee into custody to serve the maximum of the parolee's sentence. Balkcom v. Sellers, 219 Ga. 662, 135 S.E.2d 414 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No liberty interest in parole.</b> - Current Georgia parole system, as reflected in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-42, does not require the board to grant parole based upon the presence or absence of specified findings and, as a result, does not give rise to a liberty interest. Accordingly, because the plaintiff had no liberty interest in parole, the plaintiff's right to procedural due process could not have been violated and summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim was appropriate. Greene v. Georgia Pardons &amp; Parole Bd., 807 F. Supp. 748 (N.D. Ga. 1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Paragraph (c) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-42 must be read as a qualification of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-40, the provision requiring adoption of the parole guideline system. Although the legislature has required the Board of Pardon and Paroles to adopt a guideline system to be used as a framework for making more consistent parole decisions, it also preserved the Board's authority to use the Board's discretion in making final parole decisions. The statute and regulations, therefore, do not mandate that release be granted if the guidelines criteria is met. Sultenfuss v. Snow, 35 F.3d 1494 (11th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1191, 115 S. Ct. 1254, 131 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of state probation system.</b> - Defendant may come under jurisdiction of the state probation system in only one of two ways: (1) when the court elects to place the defendant in the custody of the state probation system; or (2) when the board elects to release a prisoner on "probation." 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-21.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Adult and youthful offenders treated alike.</b> - Rules and regulations of the board do not distinguish between youthful and adult offenders in setting forth those circumstances and criteria which determine when offenders will be considered for parole.

<p class="p4"><b>Authority to collect payments of fines and restitution.</b> - Collection and disbursement of payments of fines and restitution as may be established as conditions upon the grant of parole may be undertaken by probation supervisors employed by the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) so long as such payments are specifically required by court order as the result of a criminal proceeding. 1984 Op.

L. 1988, p. 1799, <span class="s1">§</span> 1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its causative agent, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), pose a grave threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. In the absence of any effective vaccination or treatment for this disease, it threatens almost certain death to all who contract it. The disease is largely transmitted through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use, not through casual contact, and, while deadly, is therefore preventable. The key component of the fight against AIDS is education. Through public education and counseling our citizens can learn how the disease is transmitted and, thus, how to protect themselves and prevent its spread. The Department of Human Resources is encouraged to continue its efforts to educate all Georgians about the disease, its causative agent, and its means of transmission. In addition, voluntary testing should be encouraged for anyone who feels at risk of infection. While education, counseling, and voluntary testing are vital to the elimination of this epidemic, other measures are needed to protect the health of our citizens, and it is the intention of the General Assembly to enact such measures in the exercise of its police powers in order to deal with AIDS and HIV infection."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No interview required.</b> - Because a prior district court order only required that the inmate be considered for parole annually under the rules in effect at the time of the inmate's offense, and neither the order nor the rule in effect at the time of the inmate's offense required interviews, the members of Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles complied with the order; and, while the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit included interviews in the list of actions encompassed by "parole reconsideration hearing," the Eleventh Circuit did not hold that an in-person interview was mandated, and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-9-43(b), the statute cited by the Eleventh Circuit, did not require such an interview.

<p class="p4"><b>No power to increase sentence.</b> - Parole board was responsible for maintaining a complete record on any person who came under the power of the board and that record included the nature and term of the individual's sentence; furthermore, it was the parole board that has the power to set the terms and conditions of parole. Thus, the acts of the parole officer, or those within the parole board who make such determinations, in setting the expiration dates of plaintiff's parole, served to break the chain of causation with respect to any error that might have flowed from the misstatement in the parole officer's motion; the parole officer had no power to increase the plaintiff's sentence and no power to set the terms of the plaintiff's parole.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of double jeopardy clause.</b> - Because parole and probation revocation proceedings are not designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law, and because the purpose of parole and probation revocation proceedings is to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of the parolee's parole or probation, such proceedings are fundamentally distinguishable from juvenile proceedings, the latter being indistinguishable from a criminal prosecution, and, thus, the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const., amend. 5 does not apply to parole and probation revocation proceedings.

<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>When hearing required.</b> - Parole, if properly granted in accordance with law and rules and regulations of the board, may be revoked only after a hearing before the board on a specific charge of violating the terms and conditions of parole except in the event the parolee becomes convicted of a crime or enters a plea of guilty to a crime in which case this section provides for revocation by the board without a hearing. However, there need not always be a parole violation before a parole may be revoked. For instance, the authority of a parole board to revoke a parole on the ground that the prisoner had not earned it and was mistakenly granted has been upheld. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-51.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notices of preliminary and final hearings</b> to consider parole revocation should include a statement that an indigent parolee may request appointed counsel. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 74-119.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rearrest of prisoner to serve remainder of original paroled sentence.</b> - Prisoner paroled after serving eight months of a one to three year sentence, and a month later convicted on a new charge, sentenced to six months, and the prisoner's parole revoked, who was released at the end of the new sentence, may not be rearrested seven years later to serve the balance of the prisoner's original sentence. 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 452.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of record.</b> - General Assembly does not have to declare that a particular court is of record for that court to be of record; rather, the legislative declaration may be helpful in ascertaining whether a particular court is of record. If a particular court keeps records as appear reasonably calculated to preserve as perpetual memorial acts and judicial proceedings of such court, the court is "court of record." 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-17.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The board may relieve a parolee or conditional releasee from making further reports and may permit such person to leave the state or county if satisfied that this is for the parolee's or conditional releasee's best interest and for the best interest of society. When a parolee or conditional releasee has, in the opinion of the board, so conducted himself or herself as to deserve a pardon or a commutation of sentence or the remission in whole or in part of any fine, forfeiture, or penalty, the board may grant such relief in cases within its power.

<p class="p5">PURPOSE. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p9">The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the By-laws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112(1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no 'right' of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and By-laws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The decision of the sending state to retake an offender shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; however, if at the time when a state seeks to retake an offender there should be pending against the offender within the receiving state any criminal charge, or if the offender should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the offender shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states that are parties to this compact without interference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p9">Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact ('Withdrawing State') by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p9">Section B. Default<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted ('Defaulting State') in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the By-laws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(1) Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(2) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the By-laws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission By-laws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the state council of such termination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">Section C. Judicial Enforcement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and By-laws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">Section D. Dissolution of Compact<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the By-laws.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p9">The General Assembly makes the following findings and determinations:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9">(1) The costs of litigation are rising dramatically. It is the responsibility of this body to seek out and adopt measures to rectify this situation. One source of the rise in litigation costs is frivolous prisoner lawsuits. Meritless lawsuits are being filed at an ever-increasing rate by prisoners who view litigation as a recreational exercise. To address the problems caused by the filing of nonmeritorious lawsuits and to relieve some of the burden placed on Georgia cities, counties, state agencies, the courts, and the Department of Corrections, this chapter is enacted. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(2) Before filing any sort of civil action, all citizens must evaluate the strengths of their claim in light of their own personal financial situation. Private individuals are forced to balance the strength of their case against the reality of court costs, filing fees, and the potential consequences of filing a frivolous or meritless lawsuit. Georgia's prisoners currently face no such dilemma. In light of the fact that all prisoners' needs are provided at city, county, or state expense, a prisoner cannot claim that his or her financial status or security would be compromised by a requirement to pay court costs and fees. To address this inequity, the General Assembly enacts this chapter. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">(3) In forma pauperis status will continue to allow the filing of an action by a prisoner, thus providing the prisoner with the constitutional right to access to courts. Freezing of the prisoner's inmate account will hold the prisoner responsible for court costs and fees by seizing any future deposits into the account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Discretionary application requirement of Georgia Prison Litigation Reform Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-12-8, was inapplicable to an injured party's renewed personal injury suit because the injured party was not a prisoner when the de novo action was filed.

<p class="p4">After the Sentence Review Panel reduced the sentences imposed on an inmate convicted of aggravated assault and false imprisonment, it was found that the Panel did not have the statutory authority to reduce the false imprisonment sentence, and a writ of mandamus was issued requiring the Department of Corrections to enforce the original sentence; the inmate's appeal from the denial of the inmate's motion to set aside the judgment granting the writ was subject to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-12-8 so the inmate had to pursue a discretionary, rather than direct, appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to comply with procedures.</b> - Court of Appeals was deprived of jurisdiction over an appeal from a prisoner's civil action concerning medical treatment the prisoner received because the prisoner failed to comply with the discretionary procedures as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-12-8.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred by failing to conduct a hearing on a prisoner's claim of indigence as the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-2(b) required a hearing before the court could order costs to be paid and there was nothing in the statute that allowed the court, on the court's own, to inquire into the truth of a pauper's affidavit to order the payment of court costs without a hearing.

<p class="p4">Prisoner's appeal in a suit seeking records from the prisoner's criminal case, which was not filed under the criminal docket numbers but as a separate civil mandamus petition, was not within the Supreme Court of Georgia's murder jurisdiction under Ga.

III(8); however, it was within the court's jurisdiction over extraordinary remedies in death penalty proceedings under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-3-3.1(4).
