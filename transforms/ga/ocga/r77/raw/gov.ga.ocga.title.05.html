<p class="p4"><b>Editor's note.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code Section 5-3-1, which was subsequently repealed but was succeeded by provisions in this article, are included in the annotations for this article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to appeal to superior court is fixed by statute,</b> and lies only from bodies or tribunals when appeal therefrom is provided by statute. Georgia Power Co. v. Friar, 47 Ga. App. 675, 171 S.E. 210 (1933), aff'd, 179 Ga. 470, 175 S.E. 807 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When amount claimed is over $50.00,</b> the law confers right to appeal to superior court. Humphrey v. Johnson, 13 Ga. App. 557, 79 S.E. 530 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When amount in controversy is $50.00 or less,</b> appeal will not lie as matter of right. Gay v. Brown, 45 Ga. App. 862, 166 S.E. 374 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party may appeal to jury in superior court.</b> Hendrix &amp; McBurney v. Mason, 70 Ga. 523 (1883); Southern Express Co. v. Hilton, 94 Ga. 450, 20 S.E. 126 (1894); Wood v. McCrary, 107 Ga. 345, 33 S.E. 395 (1899).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parties may appeal by consent from justice court to superior court</b> when amount involved is sufficient to authorize appeal. Smith v. Rawson, 61 Ga. 208 (1878).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General statutory meaning of appeal from inferior court to superior court</b> is that, after having been tried in inferior court, jurisdiction of entire case is transferred to superior court for another complete trial. Hartley v. Holwell, 202 Ga. 724, 44 S.E.2d 896 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sections dealing with appeals to superior court from inferior courts are in pari materia.</b> - In case of appeal from ordinary's court (now probate court) to superior court, the various sections relating to appeals to superior court from justice's courts, county courts, and courts of ordinary are in pari materia, and should be construed as providing for a single system of appellate procedure. Wofford v. Vandiver, 72 Ga. App. 623, 34 S.E.2d 579 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assumption of failure in whole or part to obtain relief sought.</b> - Right given to party to appeal from judgment in justice's court is predicated on assumption that by judgment complained of appellant has failed entirely in suit or has failed to recover full amount sued for, as to hold otherwise would be to run counter to the well-settled principle that no one will be heard to complain of a judgment unless one has been injured or is aggrieved thereby. Walker v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 196 Ga. 361, 26 S.E.2d 695 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party not aggrieved by judgment of trial court</b> is without legal right to except thereto, since the party has of it no just cause of complaint. Walker v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 196 Ga. 361, 26 S.E.2d 695 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When party is aggrieved by judgment or decree.</b> - Substance of judgment, and not opinion of party, determines whether or not one is aggrieved. Walker v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 196 Ga. 361, 26 S.E.2d 695 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Party is aggrieved by a judgment or decree when it operates on one's rights of property, or bears directly upon one's interest. Walker v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 196 Ga. 361, 26 S.E.2d 695 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal from confession of judgment.</b> - Appeal can be made from confession of judgment without formal entering of judgment by justice. Huff v. Whitner, Manry &amp; Co., 8 Ga. App. 25, 68 S.E. 463 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parallel between appeal granted by section and other sections.</b> - By comparing sections, which are in pari materia, substantially the same procedure is provided in cases of appeal from award of assessors in condemnation proceeding to superior court as is provided in cases of appeal from justice's court to superior court. State Hwy. Bd. v. Long, 61 Ga. App. 173, 6 S.E.2d 130 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">In cases of law, certiorari is proper remedy, in cases of fact, appeal is proper. Rogers v. Bennett, 78 Ga. 707, 3 S.E. 660 (1887). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If in case in county court, amount in controversy is more than $50.00 and case involves question of fact, appeal is proper remedy; if no question of fact is involved, but case rests solely on questions of law, certiorari is proper remedy.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between statutory appeal and appeal by writ of error.</b> - Statutory appeal providing for another trial in appellate court on merits of case is altogether different from writ of error on appeal for correction of errors in trial eventuating in judgment from which appeal is taken. In latter proceeding inquiry is into correctness of judgment upon pleading and evidence before trial court. The appellate court affirms or reverses in whole or in part the judgment on review and certifies result to trial court, when the final judgment is entered. That procedure has nothing in common with that of a statutory appeal. The statutory appeal allows litigants in certain cases the right to another trial in superior court upon compliance with certain requisites. The trial in superior court is had without reference to evidence introduced in former trial, and is a de novo investigation. City of Macon v. Ries, 179 Ga. 320, 176 S.E. 21 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal imparts same jurisdiction as was possessed by county court.</b> - In trying appeal from county court, superior court can reach no result which could not have been reached in county court had case been finally disposed of there; hence on trial of such appeal the superior court cannot entertain an equitable petition offered by the defendant as an amendment to a plea of general issue, which petition contemplates and prays for relief which only a court of equity, or a court of law exercising full equity powers, could administer, such as rescission of contracts, cancellation of promissory notes or injunction. Goodman v. Little, 213 Ga. 178, 97 S.E.2d 567 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In trying appeal from county court, superior court can deal with no question of merits except as could have been raised in county court, and can render no final judgment except such as county court had jurisdiction to render. Greer v. Burnam, 69 Ga. 734 (1882); Hufbauer v. Jackson, 91 Ga. 298, 18 S.E. 159 (1893).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Amendability of summons on appeal.</b> - When case is on appeal in superior court from justice's court, any amendment of summons whether in matter of form or of substance, may be made, which could have been made while case was pending in primary court; the only restriction on either court is that there must be enough to amend by. Wofford v. Vandiver, 72 Ga. App. 623, 34 S.E.2d 579 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Defenses allowed by oral plea must be reduced to writing on appeal.</b> - In justice's court, which is not a court of record, many defenses are allowed to be made by oral plea, and on appeal to superior court these defenses are required to be reduced to writing before case proceeds to trial.

<p class="p4"><b>New trial is upon prior pleadings and defenses subject to amendment.</b> - In appeal from county court to superior court, trial of the case is a de novo proceeding, but it by no means follows that pleadings and defenses in the case are to begin over again in the new trial; on the contrary, the new trial is had on papers connected with the case when judgment was rendered, subject to proper amendment.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal granted under statute extends to any interested party.</b> - Any interested party, dissatisfied with judgment of court of ordinary (now probate court) may appeal, except in cases involving removal of a guardian.

Mitchell v. Pyron, 17 Ga. 416 (1855).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General statutory meaning of appeal from inferior court to superior court</b> is that, after having been tried in inferior court, jurisdiction of entire case is transferred to superior court for another complete trial.

Wofford v. Vandiver, 72 Ga. App. 623, 34 S.E.2d 579 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Appeal to superior court with waiver of judgment of probate court.</b> - When appraisers filed their return for year's support, objections thereto were filed and matter was appealed by consent to superior court, and judgment of court of ordinary (now judge of probate court) was thereby expressly waived; such express waiver had same legal effect as formal decision or judgment of court of ordinary (now probate court) as to matter at issue, and status of widow as to vesting of her title was same as if decision or judgment had been formally rendered. Tilley v. King, 193 Ga. 602, 19 S.E.2d 281 (1942), later appeal, 69 Ga. App. 561, 26 S.E.2d 293 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inability to extend time for appeal.</b> - Pretermitting when the final order occurred, the superior court correctly held that the probate court had no authority to extend the time to appeal beyond the statutorily-prescribed period of 30 days. Accordingly, the probate court's order extending the period beyond that provided for in the statute was of no legal consequence, and the superior court did not err in granting summary judgment. Duncan v. Moreland, 325 Ga. App. 364, 751 S.E.2d 139 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal only where probate court's exclusive jurisdiction in whole case involved.</b> - Appeal must be from decision of court of ordinary (now probate court) in exercise of exclusive jurisdiction in whole case made by application to probate. A ruling striking some but not all grounds of caveat to application to probate a will is not such a decision. Hartley v. Holwell, 202 Ga. 724, 44 S.E.2d 896 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion to amend judgment does not extend time to file.</b> - An appeal from a motion to amend judgment of a probate court is not a final judgment and thus, is not an appealable decision within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section. Nor will such a motion extend the date for filing a notice of appeal under the plain and literal language of <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-20(a). Jabaley v. Jabaley, 208 Ga. App. 179, 430 S.E.2d 119 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An executrix's appeal from a probate court's decision was untimely and a motion to reconsider, which actually was a motion to amend, did not extend the time for appeal, and, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-3-2 and 5-3-20, the executrix should have appealed within 30 days of a final order discharging her and ordering that she return a certain amount to the estate.

<p class="p4"><b>Order denying petition by incompetent World War I veteran for removal of guardian.</b> - Appeal lies from order denying petition by incompetent World War I veteran for removal of guardian and appointment of new guardian, for accounting and recovery of moneys due, and for other relief, on account of alleged returns by guardian without proper vouchers and a devastavit as to certain amounts. Dillon v. Sills, 54 Ga. App. 299, 187 S.E. 725 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Vickery, 133 Ga. 721, 66 S.E. 918 (1910); Wash v. Wash, 145 Ga. 405, 89 S.E. 364 (1916). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisite to appeal from judgment setting apart homestead.</b> - Judgment of ordinary (now judge of probate court) setting apart a homestead can only be reviewed by certiorari unless objected to as provided for under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2838 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-13-13).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No direct appeal from interlocutory order.</b> - Appeal from probate court to superior court is for the purpose of conducting a de novo investigation in the superior court, and not for the purpose of correcting errors of law committed in the probate court. Thus, there can be no direct appeal to the superior court from an interlocutory ruling in the probate court. Driver v. State, 198 Ga. App. 643, 402 S.E.2d 524, cert. denied, 198 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal by mental health facility from adverse commitment decision.</b> - Mental health facility did not have the right to appeal from an adverse involuntary commitment decision and the facility did not have statutory authority, nor would it have been constitutional to detain the patient pending appeal of a probate court order of discharge. Georgia Mental Health Inst. v. Brady, 263 Ga. 591, 436 S.E.2d 219 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Decedent's non-party mother lacked standing to appeal.</b> - Notwithstanding a settlement agreement in which the decedent's wife released any interest in the decedent's estate, given that the decedent's mother was not a party in the probate court, despite publication of notice and service by the wife, the mother lacked standing to appeal the probate court's decision to award the wife a year's support. Booker v. Booker, 286 Ga. App. 6, 648 S.E.2d 445 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No appeal lies from preliminary ruling in main case.</b> - Appeal to superior court from preliminary ruling and before court of ordinary (now probate court) rendered judgment in the main case, would improperly usurp jurisdiction of court of ordinary, in violation of Ga. Const. 1976, Art. VI, Sec. VI, Para. I (see Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI. Sec. I, Para. I) and former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-613 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-1) depriving that court of jurisdiction to decide main question. Hartley v.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>2. Distinction Between Appeal and Certiorari</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certiorari is proper but not exclusive remedy</b> to correct certain errors in decisions of courts of ordinary (now probate courts). Stephens v. Bell, 41 Ga. App. 353, 153 S.E. 99 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election of remedy.</b> - When either appeal under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4999 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-2), or certiorari under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5181 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-2) was appropriate, movant may elect which one the movant will pursue. Pierce v. Felts, 146 Ga. 809, 92 S.E. 541 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between statutory appeal on merits and appeal by writ of error.</b> - Statutory appeal providing for another trial in appellate court on merits of the case is altogether different from writ of error on appeal for correction of errors in trial eventuating in judgment from which appeal is taken. In latter proceeding the inquiry is into correctness of judgment upon pleading and evidence before the trial court. Appellate court affirms or reverses in whole or in part the judgment on review and certifies result to trial court, where final judgment is entered. That procedure has nothing in common with that of a statutory appeal. The statutory appeal allows litigants in certain cases the right to another trial in superior court upon compliance with certain requisites. Trial in superior court is had without reference to evidence introduced in former trial, and is a de novo investigation. City of Macon v. Ries, 179 Ga. 320, 176 S.E. 21 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Province of probate court versus proper trial court.</b> - In a child's appeal of a trial court's declaratory judgment that the will of a parent was republished by a codicil and that a portion of a prior order of a probate court that the ex-spouse of the testator was to be treated as if having predeceased the testator was null and void was upheld on appeal as the issue regarding the construction of the will regarding the ex-spouse was a question of law for the trial court and was not within the jurisdiction of the probate court.

<p class="p4">When such appeal is made, it is a de novo investigation for subject matter appealed. Anderson v. Smith, 76 Ga. App. 171, 45 S.E.2d 282 (1947), overruled on other grounds, Sorrells v. Sorrells, 247 Ga. 9, 274 S.E.2d 314 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial in superior court of statutory appeals is had without reference to evidence introduced in former trial, and is a de novo investigation; when a case is on appeal, any amendment, whether in matter of form or substance, may be made which could have been made while case was in primary court.

<p class="p4"><b>Case appealed must be tried anew.</b> - It is not the province of superior court on such appeal to review and affirm or reverse rulings of ordinary (now judge of probate court), but to try issue anew and pass original judgments on questions involved as if there had been no previous trial.

<p class="p4">Effect of dismissal of appeal to superior court from judgment of court of ordinary (now probate court) admitting will to probate was to make effective judgment of court of ordinary. Hooks v. Hooks, 197 Ga. 482, 29 S.E.2d 599 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant cannot, without adverse party's consent, certify case back to inferior court.</b> - In appeal from inferior court, or assessors in condemnation proceeding, to superior court, the law contemplates that if judgment is obtained in superior court the prevailing party is entitled to superior court execution and aid of all processes of superior court to enforce the court's judgment. A dismissal of the entire case or proceedings with consent of court might be permissible under some circumstances, for this would be a final termination of the entire case or proceedings, but appellant cannot, at will and without consent of the adverse party, certify the case back to the inferior court, or to assessors, and relegate adverse party to processes of inferior court.

<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal by appealing party.</b> - The appealing party cannot dismiss the appeal to the prejudice of his coparties, as their rights on appeal are equal to those of the party making the appeal.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between dismissing case on appeal and dismissing appeal.</b> - Difference must be noted between dismissing case on appeal and dismissing an appeal. The first dismissal lets out whole case while second is an affirmance of judgment below and rights of all parties are same as if no appeal had been entered. Fagan v. McTier, 81 Ga. 73, 6 S.E. 177 (1888); State Hwy. Bd. v. Long, 61 Ga. App. 173, 6 S.E.2d 130 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While appeal only suspends and does not vacate judgment allowing probate in solemn form, so that judgment may again become effective in event of dismissal of appeal, a dismissal of the case vitiates entire proceeding, leaving parties in same status as if no action was ever commenced to probate in solemn form. Hodges v. Libbey, 120 Ga. App. 246, 170 S.E.2d 37 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Where plaintiff, appellee, obtains judgment on appeal, such judgment, as to priority, is to be treated as being of date when judgment appealed from was entered, and accordingly it takes precedence over another judgment rendered by superior court, older than judgment on appeal, but younger than original judgment entered in justice's court.

<p class="p4"><b>Sole provision for dismissing appeal.</b> - This section, except for defects in proceedings, is only provision for dismissing appeal. Rousch v. Green, 2 Ga. App. 112, 58 S.E. 313 (1907). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Only provision for dismissal of appeal to superior court, except for defects in appeal proceedings, is found in this section, which provides that no person shall be allowed to withdraw an appeal after it shall be entered but by consent of adverse party. Rabun v. Planters Cotton Oil Co., 68 Ga. App. 37, 21 S.E.2d 922 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of appeal without adverse party's consent.</b> - Under general law, an appeal is a de novo investigation, and it is error for the court to dismiss the appeal when there is no defect in appeal proceedings, and when the adverse party does not consent for appeal to be withdrawn or dismissed. Rose City Foods, Inc. v. Usry, 86 Ga. App. 307, 71 S.E.2d 649 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certification of case back to inferior court.</b> - In appeal from inferior court, or assessors in condemnation proceeding, to superior court, the law contemplates that if judgment is obtained in superior court the prevailing party is entitled to a superior court execution and aid of all processes of superior court to enforce the court's judgment. A dismissal of the entire case or proceedings with consent of court might be permissible under some circumstances, for this would be a final termination of the entire case or proceedings, but appellant cannot, at will and without consent of adverse party, certify case back to inferior court, or to assessors, and relegate adverse party to processes of inferior court. Such would be the effect of allowing appellant to withdraw the appellant's appeal without consent of adverse party contrary to statutory provisions. State Hwy. Bd. v. Long, 61 Ga. App. 173, 6 S.E.2d 130 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attempted withdrawal of appeal by appellant, in vacation.</b> - Attempt by appellant to withdraw, in vacation, appeal from judgment of court of ordinary (now probate court) establishing a will, by entry on docket by clerk of court, is a nullity. Rasberry v. Harville, 90 Ga. 530, 16 S.E. 299 (1892).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to other provisions.</b> - Provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>6-503 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-8) were applicable to appeals in condemnation proceedings instituted under statute governing condemnation by state and national government and all others exercising right of eminent domain. State Hwy. Dep't v. Blalock, 98 Ga. App. 630, 106 S.E.2d 552 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section is not a statute of limitation but is jurisdictional.</b> - Requirement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>5-3-20 that appeals to superior court must be filed "within 30 days of the date the judgment, order, or decision complained of was entered" is not a statute of limitation but is jurisdictional in nature. Rowell v. Parker, 192 Ga. App. 215, 384 S.E.2d 396 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section applied liberally in sustaining appeals.</b> - Very liberal rule has uniformly been recognized in sustaining appeals when party appealing has shown bona fide intention to do so within the four days (now 30 days) allowed by statute. Bank of Empire State v. Booton, 52 Ga. 653 (1874).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal cannot, except by consent or parties, be entered until after judgment</b> in court of ordinary (now probate court). Wright v. Clark, 139 Ga. 34, 76 S.E. 565 (1912); Bates v. Weaver, 145 Ga. 241, 88 S.E. 986 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion to amend judgment does not extend time to file.</b> - Appeal from a motion to amend judgment of a probate court is not a final judgment and, thus, is not an appealable decision within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-2(a). Nor will such a motion extend the date for filing a notice of appeal under the plain and literal language of subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-20. Jabaley v. Jabaley, 208 Ga. App. 179, 430 S.E.2d 119 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Executrix's appeal from a probate court's decision was untimely and a motion to reconsider, which actually was a motion to amend, did not extend the time for appeal, and, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-3-2 and 5-3-20, the executrix should have appealed within 30 days of a final order discharging the executrix and ordering that the executrix return a certain amount to the estate. In re Estate of Thomas, 285 Ga. App. 615, 647 S.E.2d 326 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claim was time-barred.</b> - Owner's failure to appeal the rezoning of a neighbor's property precluded the owner from attacking the rezoning decision under Spaulding County, Ga., Unified Development Ordinance <span class="s1">§</span> 418 and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-20; a claim that Spaulding County, Ga., Unified Development Ordinance <span class="s1">§</span> 414 did not comply with the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-66-1 et seq., was also time-barred, as any challenge to the rezoning had to be raised within 30 days. Hollberg v. Spalding County, 281 Ga. App. 768, 637 S.E.2d 163 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Property owners' claims against a county, the county's board of commissioners, and the county's officials were time-barred because, although the owners appeared and objected throughout a zoning process, the owners failed to file an appeal within 30 days of the zoning resolution that formed the basis of the owners' complaint as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-20(a). Instead, the owners waited nearly three years to file a new action, asserting that the owners were entitled to do so because the actions of the zoning board were void. The owners could not be permitted to do indirectly that which the law did not allow to be done directly. Fortson v. Tucker, 307 Ga. App. 694, 705 S.E.2d 895 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Summary judgment in favor of the county was affirmed because the action was filed more than 30 days after the letter was signed; thus, the trial court correctly determined that the action was untimely under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-20. The letter constituted a zoning decision by the county. Mortgage Alliance Corp. v. Pickens County, 316 Ga. App. 755, 730 S.E.2d 471 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of court in county without more than 100,000 persons.</b> - Probate court of county that did not have a population of more than 100,000 persons according to either the 1980 or 1990 decennial census lacked authority to entertain a motion for new trial, and any such motion therefore being without legal force and effect before the county probate court, would not serve to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal under either O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-20 or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(a). Jabaley v. Jabaley, 208 Ga. App. 179, 430 S.E.2d 119 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rooker-Feldman Doctrine.</b> - Rooker-Feldman barred a property owner's 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1983 claim that the owner had a grandfathered constitutional right to rent a vacation home on a short-term basis that predated enactment of a county regulation; in order for the claim to succeed, it would have been necessary for the court of appeals to conclude that a state court in an earlier case wrongly decided that any constitutional challenge to application of the regulation was barred as untimely. May v. Morgan Cnty. Ga., 878 F.3d 1001 (11th Cir. 2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal from magistrate court.</b> - Magistrate courts are not courts of record with the power to grant new trials; thus, a motion for a new trial in the magistrate court did not toll the time for filing an appeal to state or superior court. Bowen v. Ball, 215 Ga. App. 640, 451 S.E.2d 502 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Newly discovered evidence when party negligently failed to enter timely appeal.</b> - When party did not enter appeal within time prescribed and has otherwise been guilty of negligence, a new trial will not be granted on account of newly discovered evidence. Miller v. Mitchell, Reid &amp; Co., 38 Ga. 312 (1868).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 6-102 (see O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 5-3-20) did not extend time for filing notice of appeal</b> specified in Ga. L. 1957, p. 387, <span class="s1">§</span> 14 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-112). City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, 135 Ga. App. 63, 217 S.E.2d 304 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of request for rezoning.</b> - The signing of the initial document reducing to writing county commission's decision denying a request to rezone a piece of property commenced the running of the clock under this section. Where the chairman of the board of commissioners executed the written minutes of the meeting in which the request was denied on March 25, 1986, the 30-day period for the filing of an appeal began to run on that day, although official notice of the denial was not received in the mail until May 22, 1986. Chadwick v. Gwinnett County, 257 Ga. 59, 354 S.E.2d 420 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of filing in wrong court.</b> - Where a notice of appeal from a probate court decision is filed in a timely fashion, the superior court is vested with discretion in determining whether to dismiss the appeal. If the superior court finds that the filing of the notice of appeal in superior court has caused an unreasonable as well as inexcusable delay in the transmission of the record from the probate court, the appeal should be dismissed. Otherwise, the superior court is authorized to retain the appeal. In that event, the superior court has ample authority under <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-27 to enter an order directing that the probate court transmit the record to the superior court so that the appeal can be decided. Mack v. Demming, 248 Ga. 117, 281 S.E.2d 591 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Municipal court judgment.</b> - When the defendant was convicted in a municipal court that was not a city court or court of record and, thus, did not have authority to grant new trials, the defendant's motion for a new trial did not toll the 30-day time limit for filing appeals. City of Lawrenceville v. Davis, 233 Ga. App. 1, 502 S.E.2d 794 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County letter was not a "decision".</b> - Letter from a county to a developer advising that proposals would be considered under an amended ordinance limiting the development of private sewer systems was not a "decision" of the county for purposes of triggering the 30-day period to appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-20; therefore, the developer's claim of inverse condemnation never ripened. Mortgage Alliance Corp. v. Pickens County, 294 Ga. 212, 751 S.E.2d 51 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal from action of county commissioners.</b> - Action for a declaratory judgment that a vote of a board of county commissioners resulted in the denial of a rezoning application was improperly dismissed as untimely because the trial court erroneously treated the judgment as an appeal of a zoning decision. Head v. DeKalb County, 246 Ga. App. 756, 542 S.E.2d 176 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Notice is absolute jurisdictional requirement.</b> - Proper and timely filing of a notice of appeal is an absolute requirement to confer jurisdiction upon the appellate court.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of filing in wrong court.</b> - When a notice of appeal from a probate court decision is filed in a timely fashion, the superior court is vested with discretion in determining whether to dismiss the appeal. If the superior court finds that the filing of the notice of appeal in superior court has caused an unreasonable as well as inexcusable delay in the transmission of the record from the probate court, the appeal should be dismissed. Otherwise, the superior court is authorized to retain the appeal. In that event, the superior court has ample authority under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-27 to enter an order directing that the probate court transmit the record to the superior court so that the appeal can be decided.

<p class="p4"><b>Technicalities should not be determinative.</b> - People's right to litigate with governmental bodies should not be decided on technicalities any more than one citizen's right to litigate with another citizen.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of filing in wrong court.</b> - When a notice of appeal from a probate court decision is filed in a timely fashion, the superior court is vested with discretion in determining whether to dismiss the appeal. If the superior court finds that the filing of the notice of appeal in superior court has caused an unreasonable as well as inexcusable delay in the transmission of the record from the probate court, the appeal should be dismissed. Otherwise, the superior court is authorized to retain the appeal. In that event, the superior court has ample authority to enter an order directing that the probate court transmit the record to the superior court so that the appeal can be decided. Mack v. Demming, 248 Ga. 117, 281 S.E.2d 591 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Filing an independent suit, rather than a notice of appeal in the lower tribunal, was sufficient to vest the superior court with jurisdiction to decide an appeal from an adverse decision of the mayor and city council, and the superior court was bound to make the determination whether the procedural irregularity caused unreasonable or inexcusable delay.

<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between statutory appeal on merits and appeal by writ of error.</b> - Statutory appeal providing for another trial in appellate court on merits of case is altogether different from writ of error on appeal for correction of errors in trial eventuating in judgment from which appeal is taken. In latter proceeding inquiry is into correctness of judgment upon pleading and evidence before trial court. Appellate court affirms or reverses in whole or in part the judgment on review and certifies the result to the trial court, where final judgment is entered. That procedure has nothing in common with that of a statutory appeal. The statutory appeal allows litigants in certain cases the right to another trial in superior court upon compliance with certain requisites. Trial in superior court is had without reference to evidence introduced in former trial, and is a de novo investigation. City of Macon v.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Effect of Appeal on Inferior Court's Judgment</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment appealed from and opposite judgment in superior court might both be free of error.</b> - It is quite obvious that, with such latitude as to evidence as is given by this section, the judgment appealed from and a directly opposite judgment in appellate court, might both be free from error - each of them might be absolutely correct on the facts submitted, and the law applicable thereto. Abrams v. Lang, Sons, 60 Ga. 218 (1878).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal from court of ordinary (now probate court) suspends,</b> but does not vacate judgment. Snell v. Lopez, 91 Ga. App. 552, 86 S.E.2d 363 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No waiver of right to trial by jury.</b> - Because: (1) by repealing former provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-30, the Georgia legislature intended that appeals from the probate court to the superior court would continue without special limitations on the right to a jury trial; and (2) de novo appeals to the superior court from the probate court were to be tried by jury unless the right to a jury trial was waived, given that a widow specifically requested a jury trial, and hence did not waive the right, the trial court erred in denying the widow's request. Montgomery v. Montgomery, 287 Ga. App. 77, 650 S.E.2d 754 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Justice's court judgment remains operative, but incapable of enforcement</b> pending appeal. Tilley v. King, 193 Ga. 602, 19 S.E.2d 281 (1942), later appeal, 69 Ga. App. 561, 26 S.E.2d 293 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment against joint defendant is suspended pending appeal of nonsuit.</b> - As to other joint defendant when the maker and endorser of a promissory note are jointly sued and judgment rendered against the endorser and nonsuit as to maker, judgment against an endorser is suspended until rendition of the case on appeal. Turnell v. Carter, 5 Ga. App. 847, 64 S.E. 114 (1909).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When appellee is successful on appeal, lien of judgment is binding from date originally rendered.</b> - When on appeal from judgment in justice's court appellee is successful, lien of judgment will be taken as binding from date of the judgment's original rendition, and entitled to superiority over subsequently rendered judgment, notwithstanding provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 110-508 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-12-88).

<p class="p4"><b>Appeal from a decision of a magistrate court</b> is "a de novo investigation," in which the magistrate court's decision on the merits of the claim has no bearing. Howe v. Roberts, 259 Ga. 617, 385 S.E.2d 276 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of superior court upon overruling objections to petition.</b> - If judge of superior court overrules demurrer (now motion to dismiss) and objections to petition to set aside judgment of court of ordinary (now probate court) it is the judge's duty to try issues made by such petition and defensive pleadings. Hall v. First Nat'l Bank, 85 Ga. App. 498, 69 S.E.2d 679 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal imparts same jurisdiction as was possessed by inferior court.</b> - When a guardian seeks compensation for unsuccessful effort by the guardian, as attorney at law and in apparent good faith, to have order of court of ordinary (now probate court) granting encroachment upon estates of the guardian's wards modified, set aside, or vacated, the superior court on de novo appeal is vested with same discretion in matter that court of ordinary had. Whitehurst v. Singletary, 77 Ga. App. 811, 50 S.E.2d 80 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Superior court, on appeal from court of ordinary, (now probate court) has no broader jurisdiction than that of court of ordinary. Snell v. Lopez, 91 Ga. App. 552, 86 S.E.2d 363 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Superior court on trial of appeal from court of ordinary (now probate court) has no broader powers than court of ordinary itself had. Goodman v. Little, 213 Ga. 178, 97 S.E.2d 567 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appeal from court of ordinary (now probate court) brings whole case up for new hearing but with same jurisdiction as was possessed by court of ordinary. Knowles v. Knowles, 125 Ga. App. 642, 188 S.E.2d 800 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence which may be introduced.</b> - Appeal to superior court from probate court is a de novo investigation, and competent evidence may be heard which was not introduced in probate court. Dukes v. Joyner, 234 Ga. 526, 216 S.E.2d 822 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purpose of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-29 is to provide the parties to an appeal a de novo hearing, and "all competent evidence" may be introduced in the superior court regardless of whether it was submitted below. Lee v. Wainwright, 256 Ga. 478, 350 S.E.2d 238 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An appeal from the magistrate court was a de novo proceeding in which either party could adduce evidence additional to that originally presented in the magistrate court. Stamps v. Nelson, 290 Ga. App. 277, 659 S.E.2d 697 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restriction on presentation of new matters on appeal.</b> - While an appeal to the superior court from the probate court is a de novo investigation, the trial in the superior court is not a trial without limitation but is a new trial in which only the matter presented to the court below can be relitigated. Williams v. Calloway, 171 Ga. App. 286, 319 S.E.2d 500 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suit on appeal is subject to attacks upon jurisdiction which could have been made below.</b> - In case pending in superior court on appeal from judgment of justice of peace, defendant may plead any defense, including plea to jurisdiction of justice's court, which the defendant could have pled in that court, irrespective of whether, upon trial of case therein, this defense was pled. Smith v. Atlanta Mut. Ins. Co., 42 Ga. App. 254, 155 S.E. 535 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since appeal from court of ordinary (now probate court) to superior court is a de novo proceeding, any defense or attack upon jurisdiction which could have been made in the court of ordinary can be made in superior court on appeal.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Striking defendant on appeal discharges defendant from any liability in cause of action.</b> - As hearing is de novo, striking defendant on appeal against whom judgment was rendered in justice's court operates to discharge such defendant from any liability in cause of action. Hanie v. Taylor, 4 Ga. App. 545, 61 S.E. 1054 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>City charter provision permitting appeals from tax assessments to superior court.</b> - When city charter provides that a tax assessment may be appealed from taxing authorities of city to superior court, there to be disposed of as other appeal cases, such appeal is a de novo investigation and brings up the whole record, to be tried anew in superior court. City of Griffin v. Southeastern Textile Co., 79 Ga. App. 420, 53 S.E.2d 921 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Procedural Issues</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Generally, same procedural rules apply in de novo review</b> as in trials of other civil cases. Brown v. Frachiseur, 247 Ga. 463, 277 S.E.2d 16 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant, though not joining in appeal, may make any timely and appropriate amendments</b> to plea or answer already entered. Murray v. Marshall, 106 Ga. 522, 32 S.E. 634 (1899).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No greater duty is placed upon appellant to bring case to trial than upon appellee.</b> While it is true that appellant is the moving party as far as appeal is concerned, once appeal and supporting record is docketed in superior court, it is entitled to de novo treatment. Etheridge v. Etheridge, 242 Ga. 101, 249 S.E.2d 569 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal must include certified judgment or record.</b> - When there is no certified judgment or record before the superior court as to judgment rendered by appeals board, appeal to superior court is incomplete. Fletcher v. Daniels, 211 Ga. 403, 86 S.E.2d 232 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure of magistrate to send up judgment rendered by the magistrate</b> is no ground for dismissal. Pearce &amp; Renfroe v. Renfroe Bros., 68 Ga. 194 (1881).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absence of party.</b> - Appeal, unlike an action, should not be dismissed because of absence of either party. Rousch v. Green, 2 Ga. App. 112, 58 S.E. 313 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment on merits of affidavit of illegality does not preclude motion to dismiss affidavit on appeal.</b> - That plaintiff in fi. fa. went to trial in justice's court on merits of affidavit of illegality, where judgment was rendered against illegality, did not preclude plaintiff in fi. fa. from making motion to dismiss affidavit of illegality on call of case in superior court, to which defendant had appealed. Norris v. Carter &amp; Nelson, 32 Ga. App. 607, 124 S.E. 144 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party may invoke summary judgment procedure in appeal to superior court.</b> - An appeal to superior court from court of ordinary (now probate court) is subject to established procedures for civil actions, thus entitling a party to invoke summary judgment procedure. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 118 Ga. App. 440, 164 S.E.2d 361 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of additional damages in trial de novo.</b> - When plaintiff appealed to the state court from a magistrate court's decision dismissing the plaintiff's claim and awarding damages to the defendant on the defendant's counterclaim, and the plaintiff had notice of additional damages since the original counterclaim, the defendant could present evidence of additional damages of less than $5,000 relating to the defendant's counterclaim, without formal amendment of the defendant's pleadings.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment improperly granted to siblings on statute of limitations bar issue.</b> - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the siblings on the basis that the challenging sister's claim against the estate seeking an accounting was time-barred because a question of fact remained as to whether the sister was on notice that they had claimed any estate property adversely to the sister; thus, a jury had to decide whether the 10-year bar of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-27(2) began to run before that time. In re Estate of Wade, 331 Ga. App. 535, 771 S.E.2d 214 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reliance by jury upon record below in reaching the jury's decision.</b> - Jury in superior court proceeding does not review and affirm or reverse rulings of probate judge, but hears all issues anew as if there had been no previous trial, and if the jury relies upon record below or allows the judgment below to influence the jury's decision, reversible error is committed. Allmond v. Johnson, 153 Ga. App. 59, 264 S.E.2d 544 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment available in appeal from probate court's award for support.</b> - Appeal of an application for a year's support award by a probate court is a de novo proceeding in the superior court, and as such, the appeal is subject to the established procedures for civil actions, thus entitling a party to invoke summary judgment. Bright v. Knecht, 182 Ga. App. 820, 357 S.E.2d 159 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Issues never raised on appeal.</b> - Upon a wife's request for year's support, because a son never presented argument or evidence to contest the amount sought by the wife, never sought a hearing on the amount, and failed to rebut the wife's claim of entitlement to that support, the son's claims of error on appeal from an order granting the wife summary judgment in the superior court lacked merit.

<p class="p4"><b>Section provides for review of decisions in exercise of judicial powers.</b> - Certiorari is a remedy whereby a litigant may have review of judgment or decision of inferior judicatory or a person exercising judicial powers.

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutional limitation on legislature's power to provide for superior court review.</b> - Only power and authority given by the Georgia Constitution to superior courts to correct errors in inferior courts, is by writ of certiorari.

<p class="p4"><b>Writ of certiorari as full and adequate remedy at law.</b> - Writ of certiorari ordinarily furnishes a full and adequate remedy at law for correction of errors in decisions by municipal corporations, courts, or councils, rendered in exercise of judicial powers; so that even though a property right may be primarily involved in such manner as would authorize an injured party to resort to equity, the injured party is not entitled to claim such relief, when the injured party has already appeared before municipal judicatory, and that body has rendered an adverse decision.

<p class="p4">Superior court erred in dismissing the appellant's petition for certiorari in which the appellant sought review of a hearing officer's decision upholding the public housing authority's decision to terminate the appellant's Section 8 voucher benefits as the hearing officer's decision was subject to review on certiorari because the hearing officer's decision was the result of quasi-judicial action as the appellant had the right to proper notice and a fair hearing, the appellant was afforded the opportunity to present evidence under judicial forms of procedure, and the hearing officer made a decision after determining the facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard and applying the appropriate law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Termination of city employee.</b> - City manager's decision approving the termination of a city employee was subject to review by a petition for a writ of certiorari. Salter v.

<p class="p4">Although a trial court's decision to dismiss an action by dismissed city employees was erroneously based on the court's determination that the employees had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies from their claim that the reduction-in-force ordinance, Atlanta, Ga., Code <span class="s1">§</span> 114-55, was not properly followed, as they had properly appealed to the Service Board and the Board had denied their claims on appeal, the dismissal was proper for other reasons; after the Board's final decision denying the employees' appeals, they failed to properly and timely file a writ of certiorari in the trial court pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-4-1(a) and 5-4-6 in order to obtain review of that decision. Jordan v. City of Atlanta, 283 Ga. App. 285, 641 S.E.2d 275 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to review, pursuant to a writ of certiorari, the termination of a city employee because a city manager was not acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in permitting an employee to present evidence prior to finalizing the city manager's decision to terminate the employee; the city charter and personnel ordinance did not grant city employees a right to pretermination hearings. Goddard v. City of Albany, 285 Ga. 882, 684 S.E.2d 635 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Other employment actions.</b> - Writ of certiorari was a remedy to correct errors committed by any inferior judicatory or any person exercising judicial powers, and since the county police sergeant's hearing on the county police sergeant's demotion was a quasi-judicial hearing, and the availability of petitioning for a writ of certiorari was not otherwise limited by law, the county police sergeant was authorized to seek relief in the trial court without first pursuing a discretionary appeal to the county board of commissioners.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exercises of legislative, executive or ministerial functions.</b> - Writ of certiorari lies to correct errors or restrain excesses of jurisdiction of inferior courts and officers acting judicially only; the writ will, therefore, not be issued to officers whose functions and duties are ministerial, executive, or legislative and not judicial. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 181 Ga. 75, 181 S.E. 834, answer conformed to, 52 Ga. App. 35, 182 S.E. 204 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Certiorari is not an appropriate remedy to review or obtain relief from judgment, decision, or action of inferior judicatory or body rendered in exercise of legislative, executive, or ministerial functions.

<p class="p4">In determining whether a writ of certiorari will lie to a decision or judgment of an inferior court, a paramount question for consideration is whether there was exercised a judicial function as distinguished from a ministerial act, for certiorari is available for correction of erroneous judgments in exercise of judicial powers, but ordinarily is not a proper remedy to correct errors relating to ministerial acts.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of conditional use permit was quasi-judicial.</b> - Because a decision denying a conditional use permit required the zoning board to determine the facts and apply the ordinance's legal standards to them, which was a decision-making process akin to a judicial act, the decision was reviewable by certiorari under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span>n 5-4-1(a); the owner's failure to file a certiorari petition barred the owner's claims. O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-66-3(4)(E)'s reference to "legislative" action was not determinative. Riverdale Land Group, LLC v. Clayton County, 354 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Review by writ defined by statute.</b> - In an action wherein a property owner was challenging the denial of a site development permit, the grant of the county's motion to dismiss was reversed, in part, as to the owner seeking review by writ of certiorari because the scope of review by writ of certiorari was defined by statute and the statute's scope could not be enlarged by local ordinance regardless of whether the zoning ordinance provided specifically for such review.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>What Is Judicial Action</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What is judicial action.</b> - Judicial action is an adjudication upon rights of parties who in general appear or are brought before tribunal by notice or process, and upon whose claims some decision or judgment is rendered; it implies impartiality, disinterestedness, a weighing of adverse claims, and is inconsistent with discretion on one hand - for tribunal must decide according to law and rights of parties - or with dictation on the other; for in first instance the court must exercise the court's own judgment under the law, and not act under a mandate from another power. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 181 Ga. 75, 181 S.E. 834, answer conformed to, 52 Ga. App. 35, 182 S.E. 204 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Character of action determinative.</b> - Character of action in a given case must decide whether that action is judicial, ministerial, or legislative, or whether it be simply that of a public agent of the county or state, as in its varied jurisdiction it may by turns be each. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 181 Ga. 75, 181 S.E. 834, answer conformed to, 52 Ga. App. 35, 182 S.E. 204 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Test in determining whether proceeding is judicial.</b> - In determining whether proceeding is judicial in character, question hinges not on whether parties at interest were in fact given an opportunity to be heard, but the test is whether parties at interest had a right under law to demand a trial in accordance with judicial procedures. South View Cem. Ass'n v. Hailey, 199 Ga. 478, 34 S.E.2d 863 (1945); What It Is, Inc. v. Jackson, 146 Ga. App. 574, 246 S.E.2d 693, cert. denied, 242 Ga. 204, 249 S.E.2d 614 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of fact that tribunal could have acted nonjudicially.</b> - If a person or tribunal has right under proper delegated authority to act in judicial capacity, character of such judicial procedure, when had as prescribed, is not impaired because under the law such tribunal might have had alternative right to act ex parte without trial, but refused to exercise such right. South View Cem. Ass'n v. Hailey, 199 Ga. 478, 34 S.E.2d 863 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact of trial when none is authorized by statute.</b> - Statute giving county commissioners in certain counties power to grant or refuse permission to establish cemeteries outside limits of incorporated towns does not confer upon such commission the duties and functions of a court, so that writ of certiorari might issue from its action taken upon any such application; rather the commission's action is merely entertainment and refusal of a request pertaining to executive duties of commissioners, and fact that there is a trial, when none is authorized under statute, does not operate to change nature and character of procedure. South View Cem. Ass'n v. Hailey, 199 Ga. 478, 34 S.E.2d 863 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Writ of certiorari as full and adequate remedy at law.</b> - Writ of certiorari ordinarily furnishes a full and adequate remedy at law for correction of errors in decisions by municipal corporations, courts, or councils, rendered in exercise of judicial powers; so that even though a property right may be primarily involved in such manner as would authorize injured party to resort to equity, one is not entitled to claim such relief, when one has already appeared before a municipal judicatory, and that body has rendered an adverse decision.

<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff may obtain order directing clerk to issue writ.</b> - If clerk fails to issue writ of certiorari before term to which the writ is returnable, plaintiff may, if there has been no laches on the plaintiff's part, move the court for an order directing the clerk to issue a writ. Without such order, the clerk has no authority to issue a writ of certiorari subsequently to the term to which the writ was originally returnable, and a motion to dismiss will be sustained if one attempts to do so.

<p class="p4">Failure of justice of peace to send up copies of proceedings in the justice's court when the proceedings are necessary to determination of cause is good ground for dismissal of certiorari; certiorari will not be dismissed because the magistrate fails to send up copies of proceedings when errors complained of in petition as verified by answer can be fully considered and determined without reference to such proceedings.

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of writ improper.</b> - Since the municipal court did not inquire into the defendant's understanding of the nature of the violation to which the defendant confessed guilt, and the record likewise did not show any factual basis for the plea independent of such an inquiry, the superior court erred in denying a writ of certiorari.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Decisions of municipal corporations, courts, or councils rendered in judicial capacity.</b> - Writ of certiorari lies for correction of errors in decisions by municipal corporations, courts, or councils, like other inferior judicatories, when rendered in exercise of their judicial powers. City of Cedartown v. Pickett, 193 Ga. 840, 20 S.E.2d 263 (1942); 106 Forsyth Corp. v. Bishop, 362 F. Supp. 1389 (M.D. Ga. 1972), aff'd, 482 F.2d 280 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1044, 95 S. Ct. 2660, 45 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Petition subject to renewal.</b> - Trial court properly denied the city's motion to dismiss the landowner's renewed petition for writ of certiorari because the case was capable of renewal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-2-61(a) as the trial court had properly determined that the lack of personal service as to the zoning board of appeals did not render the petition void and, thus, a bar to renewal. City of Dunwoody v. Discovery Practice Management, Inc., 338 Ga. App. 135, 789 S.E.2d 386 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exercises of legislative, executive, or ministerial functions.</b> - Certiorari is not an appropriate remedy to review or obtain relief from judgment, decision, or action of inferior judicatory or body rendered in exercise of legislative, executive, or ministerial functions. City of Cedartown v. Pickett, 193 Ga. 840, 20 S.E.2d 263 (1942); Presnell v. McCollum, 112 Ga. App. 579, 145 S.E.2d 770 (1965); 106 Forsyth Corp. v. Bishop, 362 F.

<p class="p4">In determining whether a writ of certiorari will lie to a decision or judgment of an inferior court, a paramount question for consideration is whether there was exercised a judicial function as distinguished from a ministerial act, for certiorari is available for correction of erroneous judgments in exercise of judicial powers, but ordinarily is not a proper remedy to correct errors relating to ministerial acts. Hayes v. Brown, 205 Ga. 234, 52 S.E.2d 862 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certiorari lies only as to issues raised in trial court.</b> - Error which may be corrected by writ of certiorari is one made by tribunal whose judgment is being reviewed because of such error. When it does not appear from the record that issue was made in trial court, it cannot be raised for first time by certiorari in superior court and reviewed in the Supreme Court. Smith v. Mayor of Macon, 202 Ga. 68, 42 S.E.2d 128, answer conformed to, 75 Ga. App. 136, 42 S.E.2d 569 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The writ of certiorari does not lie to correct a judgment of an inferior judicatory until after a final determination of the case. Jenga v. Deveaux, 193 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When there are disputed issues of fact.</b> - When in trial of case pending in justice's court, there are disputed issues of fact, judgment rendered by magistrate cannot be directly reviewed by writ of certiorari, but there must be appeal, either to jury in that court or to superior court. Story v. Printup, 52 Ga. App. 818, 184 S.E. 752 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Available for decisions of any inferior judicatory.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-3 has reference to the correction of errors in cases in which the writ of certiorari lies, and the writ shall apply to persons dissatisfied with the decision or judgment of any inferior judicatory.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to issue writ.</b> - Although the city board of appeals was served with a copy of the petition for certiorari, a sanction of the writ by the superior court, and summonses, the superior court erred in denying the board's motion to dismiss because there was a failure to comply with the statutory requirements as no writ had been issued and served; and, while it was the clerk's duty to issue the writ, it was also separately the duty of the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel to ensure that a writ was served, and the petitioner could not completely divorce itself from the failure that occurred in the current case.

<p class="p6"><b>2. Sufficiency of Assignment of Error</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Must specify wherein verdict or judgment is erroneous.</b> - Petition merely objecting to judgment, without stating reason, is insufficient. Papworth v. City of Fitzgerald, 111 Ga. 54, 36 S.E. 311 (1900); Harrell v. City of Quitman, 17 Ga. App. 299, 86 S.E. 662 (1915). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Failure to point out error in rulings renders assignment of error insufficient. Illinois C.R.R. v. Banks, 31 Ga. App. 756, 122 S.E. 85 (1924). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Mere general averment of error, in connection with which there is no statement or assignment whatever as to how or wherein rulings complained of were erroneous, presents no case or question for decision by judge of the superior court. Chan v. Judge, 36 Ga. App. 13, 134 S.E. 925 (1926); Davis v. Lee, 38 Ga. App. 667, 145 S.E. 110 (1928). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Assignment of error upon jury charge must specify error or state alternate charge.</b> - In petition for certiorari, assignment of error upon excerpt from charge of court presents no question for reviewing court when it is not pointed out wherein excerpt is erroneous, or why it should not have been given, or why different instructions should have been given.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Must set forth ordinance allegedly violated or deny ordinance's existence.</b> - Petition for certiorari from recorder's court, seeking review by superior court of judgment, is fatally defective when the petition does not set out copy of ordinance upon which charge or summons is predicated, or else a denial of its existence. Wright v. City of Atlanta, 61 Ga. App. 650, 7 S.E.2d 215 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's petition for writ of certiorari was fatally and fundamentally flawed, as the writ did not recite the provisions of the statute under which defendant was convicted, so the appellate court had no context within which to review the evidence. Collier v. Merck, 261 Ga. App. 831, 584 S.E.2d 1 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Petition for certiorari from conviction for violation of municipal ordinance should contain provisions of ordinance.</b> - When it is sought to review by certiorari a conviction on charge of having violated a municipal ordinance, existence of which is admitted in petition for certiorari, provisions of ordinance should be stated in petition, but it is not necessary that ordinance be literally copied therein. Childrey v. City of Atlanta, 62 Ga. App. 107, 7 S.E.2d 919 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a city's petition for certiorari plainly and distinctly asserted the errors complained of, the superior court did not err in denying the city's motion to dismiss; moreover, the record reflected that the bar managers cited for violation of Atlanta, Ga., Code of Ordinances <span class="s1">§</span> 10-46 (1995) preserved the issue as to the constitutionality of the ordinance and the ordinance's enforcement. City of Atlanta v. Jones, 283 Ga. App. 125, 640 S.E.2d 698 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certification of payment of costs and giving of security need not be attached to petition.</b> - It is not necessary to attach to petition for certiorari a certificate of magistrate that costs have been paid and security given before sanction of petition of judge of superior court can be obtained. Jones v. Johnson &amp; Ledbetter Constr. Co., 185 Ga. 323, 194 S.E. 902 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial notice.</b> - Trial court erred by relying upon a county ordinance not properly in the record to support the court's conclusion that a writ of certiorari was an appropriate method of judicial review of actions undertaken by a county planning commission in approving a developer's plan to build a subdivision of town homes; as a result, the appellate court was precluded from reviewing the owners' constitutional challenge to the ordinance.

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provisions of subsection (a) are mandatory.</b> - Provisions of section are absolute and mandatory in respect of time within which writs of certiorari shall be applied for, and cannot be varied or departed from in exercise of any judicial discretion. Hitt v. City of Atlanta, 103 Ga. App. 717, 120 S.E.2d 339 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Petition must be presented within thirty days</b> from rendition of verdict, if the petition does not complain of error in dismissing motion for new trial. Autrey &amp; Peebles v. Carson Naval Stores Co., 29 Ga. App. 422, 115 S.E. 924 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application for writ of certiorari must be made within 30 days</b> of final determination of case in inferior court. Eisenberg v. Fuller, 148 Ga. App. 603, 252 S.E.2d 17 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Failure to obtain the requisite sanction from the appropriate judge is not an amendable defect if the 30-day time requirement for applying for certiorari under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-6(a) has expired. Cobb County v. Herren, 230 Ga. App. 482, 496 S.E.2d 558 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although a trial court's decision to dismiss an action by dismissed city employees was erroneously based on the court's determination that the employees had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies from their claim that the reduction-in-force ordinance, Atlanta, Ga., Code <span class="s1">§</span> 114-55, was not properly followed, as they had properly appealed to the Service Board and the Board had denied their claims on appeal, the dismissal was proper for other reasons; after the Board's final decision denying the employees' appeals, the employees failed to properly and timely file a writ of certiorari in the trial court pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-4-1(a) and 5-4-6 in order to obtain review of that decision. Jordan v. City of Atlanta, 283 Ga. App. 285, 641 S.E.2d 275 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When judgment is not final, subsequent judgments pertaining to it are not final.</b> - When verdict and judgment rendered in Municipal Court of Atlanta is not a final judgment, neither judgment of trial judge overruling motion for new trial excepting to such verdict and judgment, nor judgment of appellate division of that court affirming such judgment of trial judge, is a final judgment. Reed v. V.H. Kriegshaber &amp; Son, 44 Ga. App. 64, 160 S.E. 560 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of mandamus action does not excuse compliance with section.</b> - Because certiorari and mandamus are completely different remedies as to subject matter, procedure, and nature of relief, filing a mandamus action does not excuse compliance with requirements of this section. Richardson v. Rector, 134 Ga. App. 116, 213 S.E.2d 488 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mandamus not appropriate remedy for homeowners denied building permit.</b> - Mandamus was not the appropriate remedy for homeowners whose building permit had been denied by a city; rather, the homeowners were required to pursue the homeowners' appeal through the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari, pursuant to Statesboro, Ga., Zoning Ordinance <span class="s1">§</span> 1809 and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-1(a); moreover, the homeowners' appeal was untimely under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-6(a). City of Statesboro v. Dickens, 293 Ga. 540, 748 S.E.2d 397 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section does not deal with means of preserving exceptions to trial court rulings.</b> - This section merely limits time after final judgment in which writ of certiorari may be applied for, but does not attempt to go into manner in which exceptions to orders and rulings prior to final judgment may be preserved. Taylor v. Golian Steel &amp; Iron Co., 86 Ga. App. 639, 72 S.E.2d 196 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certiorari from appeals in justice's court are from jury verdict.</b> - It is from verdict of jury in appeal cases in justice's court that certiorari may be taken, not from judgment which justice may enter thereon. Western &amp; A.R.R. v. Carson, 70 Ga. 388 (1883).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact of timely application must appear from record,</b> unless answer of justice verifies that fact. Duke v. Story, 113 Ga. 112, 38 S.E. 337 (1901); Landrum v. Moss, 1 Ga. App. 216, 57 S.E. 965 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section governs time for second application when first application dismissed for noncompliance.</b> - When application for certiorari is a nullity, because of failure to comply with the requirement as to bond, time within which second application may be made was governed by former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 4365, 5188 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-6), and was not extended by law as to renewal of cases within six months after dismissal under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4381 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-2-61). Tuten v. Showalter, 14 Ga. App. 690, 82 S.E. 154 (1914); Autrey &amp; Peebles v. Carson Naval Stores Co., 29 Ga. App. 422, 115 S.E. 924 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Renewal of previously dismissed, but timely certiorari in same cause.</b> - When certiorari is applied for after expiration of statutory period from date of judgment complained of, petition should show on the petition's face that the petition is a renewal of a previously dismissed certiorari sued out within proper time in same cause, and that renewal is within six months from date of dismissal of previous certiorari. Unless all of these facts appear in petition for certiorari, the judge of superior court has no jurisdiction of case, and should refuse to sanction petition; and, if such petition is sanctioned, it should be dismissed when proper motion therefor is made upon hearing of certiorari. Smith v. City of Atlanta, 48 Ga. App. 853, 174 S.E. 171 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Valid writ of error suspends running of time limit for application for writ of certiorari.</b> Gavant v. Berger, 51 Ga. App. 628, 181 S.E. 210 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time ran from denial of motion to set aside default judgment, not default judgment itself.</b> - In a dispute between a seller of storage units and the buyer's spouse, resulting in a default judgment for the seller in magistrate court, the superior court erred in dismissing the spouse's petition for certiorari as untimely because the petition was filed within 30 days of the denial of the spouse's motion to set aside as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-6(a); it was not required that the motion be filed within 30 days of the default judgment. Jorree v. PMB Rentals, LLC, 349 Ga. App. 332, 825 S.E.2d 817 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Timely petition was improperly dismissed.</b> - Superior court improperly dismissed as untimely appellant city's petition for a writ of certiorari challenging a civil service board's decision as the petition was timely filed for purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-6(a) since: (1) the last day to file the petition fell on Thanksgiving Day; (2) the Friday after Thanksgiving day, like Thanksgiving day, was a legal holiday as set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-4-1; and (3) the petition was filed on the very next business day, as allowed by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(d)(3). City of Atlanta v. Hector, 256 Ga. App. 665, 569 S.E.2d 600 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Eleventh of November, although a legal holiday, is included in computing 30-day period.</b> - In computing 30 days within which petition for certiorari must be presented eleventh of November, although a legal holiday and last day, must be included. Freeman v. Beneficial Loan Soc'y, 42 Ga. App. 294, 155 S.E. 786 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. What Are Final Judgments</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Writ of certiorari lies only after rendition of judgment making final disposition of case,</b> and then only to correct errors which affect such final judgment. It does not lie to correct errors affecting only judgment which is not final. Reed v. V.H. Kriegshaber &amp; Son, 44 Ga. App. 64, 160 S.E. 560 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Writ of certiorari lies only after rendition of final judgment.</b> Hayes v. Brown, 205 Ga. 234, 52 S.E.2d 862 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Final disposition of case in inferior court is prerequisite</b> to writ of certiorari. Singer Mfg. Co. v. McNeal Paint &amp; Glass Co., 117 Ga. 1005, 44 S.E. 801 (1903).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absent final judgment, court is correct in refusing to act.</b> - When there has been no final judgment rendered by the state court, the superior court is correct in refusing to exercise the superior court's supervisory powers through a writ of certiorari. Attwell v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., 159 Ga. App. 811, 285 S.E.2d 199 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment of justice of peace, refusing to allow amendment to petition</b> is not final determination. Felker v. Freeman, 46 Ga. App. 767, 169 S.E. 247 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Verdict and judgment against special plea of no partnership</b> is not a final judgment. Reed v. V.H. Kriegshaber &amp; Son, 44 Ga. App. 64, 160 S.E. 560 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment sustaining motion to dismiss and granting leave to amend</b> is not final judgment, judgment sustaining demurrer (now motion to dismiss) to petition, which grants leave to plaintiff to amend on pain of dismissing suit, is not a final judgment, and certiorari does not lie thereto.

<p class="p4"><b>Provisions for notice to opposite party are mandatory.</b> Glover v. Berry Sch., 90 Ga. App. 232, 83 S.E.2d 22 (1954);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 19-212).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice to opposite party is required unless prevented by unavoidable cause or waived in writing.</b> - Notice to be given to opposite party in interest, that party's agent, or attorney, unless prevented by unavoidable cause or unless waived in writing, and when such notice is not given and it is not shown to be due to unavoidable cause, certiorari shall be dismissed unless waived in writing. Attebery v. City of Manchester, 76 Ga. App. 265, 45 S.E.2d 781 (1947);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 19-212).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to serve judge, not basis for dismissal.</b> - Failure to properly serve respondent, a municipal court judge whose decision was being reviewed, was not a basis for dismissal when the judge made a general appearance and addressed the merits of the case.

<p class="p4">Superior court erred in denying the city board of appeals' motion to dismiss a petition for writ of certiorari because the service of the original petition upon the city attorney was not sufficient service upon the city as an opposite party when the city was not named as the opposite party, and only the board and the board's members were named in the original petition as the board (as respondent) and the city (as the proper opposite party) were two separate entities with possibly conflicting interests.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to serve board.</b> - Superior court did not err in dismissing petition for certiorari from a decision of the Atlanta Civil Service Board, since the board was not named as a party as required by subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-6, and service of the petition on the City of Atlanta was not service on the City of Atlanta Civil Service Board as a matter of law. Fisher v. City of Atlanta, 212 Ga. App. 635, 442 S.E.2d 762 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the city board of appeals was served with a copy of the petition for certiorari, a sanction of the writ by the superior court, and summonses, the superior court erred in denying the board's motion to dismiss because there was a failure to comply with the statutory requirements as no writ had been issued and served; and, while it was the clerk's duty to issue the writ, it was also separately the duty of the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel to ensure that a writ was served, and the petitioner could not completely divorce itself from the failure that occurred in the current case.

<p class="p4">Superior court erred in denying the city board of appeals' motion to dismiss a petition for writ of certiorari because there was a complete failure to even issue a writ of certiorari, let alone serve the same upon the board as the respondent; and the petitioner failed to name the city as an opposite party, and failed to serve the city with a copy of the petition and with a copy of the writ in the time required.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between function of exceptions and function of traverse.</b> - Function of exceptions to answer of magistrate to petition for certiorari is to specify defects in such answer, and such exceptions do not take place of traverse to answer whose function is to controvert truth of facts set forth in answer. West v. State, 103 Ga. App. 71, 118 S.E.2d 491 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Traverse of answer of trial judge must be verified affidavit.</b> West v. State, 103 Ga. App. 71, 118 S.E.2d 491 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absent traverse, answer is conclusive as to recital of facts.</b> - Upon trial of certiorari when judge's answer to petition is untraversed, judge of superior court must take as true the statement of facts and evidence adduced upon the trial of case as contained in an answer and in those portions of the petition for certiorari verified thereby as true. West v. State, 103 Ga. App. 71, 118 S.E.2d 491 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the statute does not require that the answer be traversed, if no traverse is filed, the answer becomes conclusive as to recitals of fact contained therein, and the answer becomes the record on which the superior court is authorized to rule on the merits of the petition. Bembry v. Johnson, 152 Ga. App. 422, 263 S.E.2d 229 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although a traverse to an answer is now optional, the recitals of fact contained in the answer are rendered conclusive when neither a traverse nor an exception is filed. This being so, the court is entitled to rely upon the factual recitals of the answer as a part of the record, and to use the recitals as a basis for the court's findings. Cox v. City of Lawrenceville, 168 Ga. App. 119, 308 S.E.2d 224 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Traverse and exception unnecessary when petition sufficiently establishes error and answer merely denies allegations.</b> - When facts sufficient to establish error are alleged in petition and inferior court files answer merely denying these allegations, issues are sufficiently developed for superior court review and exception and subsequent traverse to answer are no longer necessary.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to attach copy of proceedings, where answer indicates intention to do so.</b> - When, in certiorari proceeding, record does not show that any copy of proceedings was sent up with answer of trial judge, although statement of judge indicates intention to attach such papers, answer is incomplete in that respect.

<p class="p4"><b>When certiorari is sustained on ground that venue was not established.</b> - When, upon conviction in criminal court of county, defendant applied for writ of certiorari to superior court of county on ground that state had failed to establish venue of case, and upon hearing, state admitted the state's failure to establish venue, it is proper for the superior court to sustain certiorari and remand the case to the trial court for another trial, and it is not proper for the superior court in such case to enter final judgment therein, as error complained of is not an error of law which must finally govern the case, and it cannot be known with certainty that evidence on another trial would be the same.

<p class="p4"><b>On new trial by superior court order, formal evidence of latter's judgment is unnecessary.</b> - After case has been tried in justice's court and on certiorari new trial has been ordered, a new trial may be lawfully had in the magistrate's court without producing therein any formal evidence of a judgment rendered in superior court.

<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any person who has been convicted of any criminal or quasi-criminal offense or violation of any ordinance, in any inferior judicatory by whatever name called, except constitutional city courts or state courts, exercising criminal or quasi-criminal jurisdiction, who desires a writ of certiorari to review and correct the judgment of conviction in the case shall be entitled to a supersedeas of the judgment if he files with the clerk of the court, or, if there is no clerk, with the judge thereof, or with the commissioners if it is a court presided over by commissioners with no clerk, a bond payable to the state, or, if the conviction is in a municipal court, payable to the municipality, in amount and with security acceptable to and to be approved by the clerk, judge, or majority of the commissioners, as the case may be, conditioned that the defendant will personally appear and abide the final judgment, order, or sentence upon him in the case. The bond, if payable to the state, may be forfeited in the same manner as any other criminal bond in any court having jurisdiction. If the bond is payable to the municipal corporation, it may be forfeited according to the procedure prescribed in the municipal ordinance or charter. Alternatively, an action may be brought on the bond in any court having jurisdiction. Upon the giving of bond the defendant shall be released from custody in like manner as defendants are released upon supersedeas bonds in criminal cases where a notice of appeal has been filed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the defendant is unable because of his indigence to give bond and makes this fact appear by affidavit to be filed with the judge, clerk, or commissioners, as the case may be, the same shall operate as a supersedeas of the judgment; provided, however, that the defendant shall not be set at liberty unless he gives bond as prescribed in subsection (a) of this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The supersedeas provided for in this Code section shall operate to suspend the judgment of conviction until the case is finally heard and determined by the superior court to which it is taken by certiorari or by the Court of Appeals upon appeal, provided that within the time prescribed by law the defendant shall apply for and procure the writs and remedies provided by law for reviewing the judgment complained of. The supersedeas shall be equally applicable whether the judge of the superior court to whom the petition for certiorari is presented sanctions it or refuses it, provided that within the time provided by law the defendant diligently files a notice of appeal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The object of this Code section is to provide a method by which a defendant may obtain a supersedeas so long as he is prosecuting or is entitled under the law to prosecute the proceeding brought or to be brought to review the conviction of which he is complaining, or any intermediate appellate judgment rendered thereon, in order that the defendant shall not be deprived of his right to apply to the courts by being compelled to serve his sentence or pay a fine before he has had the full opportunity allowed him by law of taking the necessary proceedings to correct and review his conviction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No authority exists to fine or imprison defendant.</b> - A case is not a criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding when issues before police committee of general council of city were in nature of a civil proceeding, and committee had no authority to fine or to deprive officer of the officer's liberty, but the only authority vested in the committee was to exonerate, to suspend, or to discharge.

<p class="p4"><b>Certiorari from proceeding in municipal court to determine whether nuisance exists.</b> - Proceeding in municipal court to determine question of whether nuisance exists was not criminal or quasi-criminal in nature since the court cannot fine or imprison the defendant in error, and the bond required for certiorari was that provided for in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 19-206, 19-207, 19-208 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-5) for civil proceedings, and bond under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 19-214, 19-215, 19-216 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-4-20) would not suffice.

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bond shall be conditioned to abide final judgment of superior court as well as inferior court.</b> - Bond approved by clerk of lower court, if there be one, conditioned to abide final judgment of superior court, as well as inferior court, must be filed as a condition precedent to obtaining writ of certiorari. Moon v. City of Jefferson, 10 Ga. App. 572, 73 S.E. 854 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Should be conditioned that defendant appear and abide by judgment.</b> - Bond conditioned for appearance of defendant to abide final judgment of superior court is insufficient. It should be conditioned to appear "and" abide by final judgment, as the two conditions are not synonymous. Scott v. City of Camilla, 7 Ga. App. 689, 67 S.E. 846 (1910); Ruffin v. City of Millen, 18 Ga. App. 784, 90 S.E. 654 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Abrogation of bond.</b> - When one convicted of misdemeanor in county criminal court has appealed by certiorari and successive writs of error all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States, and verdict and sentence have been affirmed, and remittitur from the Court of Appeals of Georgia affirming such verdict and sentence has been made the judgment of superior court, such verdict and sentence become final; and when the defendant is thereafter arrested, the supersedeas certiorari bond executed in that case is abrogated and becomes functus officio, and the defendant is not thereafter entitled to remain at liberty by virtue of such bond. Hodges v. Balkcom, 209 Ga. 856, 76 S.E.2d 798 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Execution and Signatures</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When agent for surety signs certiorari bond, agent's authority must expressly appear.</b> - When on certiorari from trial court, certiorari bond is signed by one as agent for surety named thereon, authority of such agent must expressly appear. Taylor v. City of Atlanta, 84 Ga. App. 739, 67 S.E.2d 143 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When attorney signs bond for surety without power of attorney attached.</b> - When defendant in certiorari made a motion to dismiss certiorari for reason that surety on certiorari bond had executed the bond by the defendant's attorney and that the bond was not a valid bond, because no power of attorney was attached thereto showing authority of the attorney to sign the bond for the surety, the court properly sustained the motion and dismissed certiorari. Mantovani v. City of Atlanta, 43 Ga. App. 787, 160 S.E. 129 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>3. Validity of Bond</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bond payable to city recorder charged with responsibilities involving forfeiture of appearance bonds.</b> - When city recorder is person charged with responsibility of forfeiting appearance bonds when the bond's conditions have not been complied with, and the recorder necessarily does so for and on behalf of the city as such officer, petition showing that bond hereunder was made payable to city recorder or the recorder's successors in office affirmatively shows a valid contract between obligors and city for this purpose, and it was not subject to dismissal upon this ground. Soles v. City of Vidalia, 92 Ga. App. 839, 90 S.E.2d 249 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bonds filed in municipal court, payable to Governor.</b> - Bonds filed by defendants in municipal trial court, naming therein as obligee the Governor of Georgia and the Governor's successor in office are not legal bonds as are contemplated under provisions of this section, and failure of petitioners to give proper bond rendered the petition for certiorari void. Coleman v. Mayor of Savannah, 102 Ga. App. 664, 117 S.E.2d 186 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of bond is not affirmatively established by allegations to that effect in petition.</b> Hubert v. City of Thomasville, 18 Ga. App. 756, 90 S.E. 720 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certificate of clerk or trial judge approving bond is not conclusive of bond's validity.</b> - While certificate from clerk or presiding officer of trial court that bond has been accepted and approved should be accepted as prima facie true, it is not conclusive that proper bond has been given; and if bond itself is sent up with the record and shows on the bond's face that legal bond has not been given, certiorari should be dismissed. Mantovani v. City of Atlanta, 43 Ga. App. 787, 160 S.E. 129 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In petition for certiorari from recorder's court, approval of bond by city clerk is insufficient.</b> - When, in petition for certiorari to superior court to correct judgment of recorder's court convicting the petitioner of violation of a city ordinance, instead of being approved by clerk of recorder's court or by recorder in absence of clerk, the supersedeas-appearance bond attached to petition was approved by the city clerk, the superior court did not err in overruling the petition for certiorari, as conditions precedent to application for certiorari, established by this section in such cases as this, are mandatory. Griffin v. City of Albany, 88 Ga. App. 229, 76 S.E.2d 436 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signing one's own bond and depositing security in cash.</b> - Bond requirements do not specify posting of property bond, but only that bond should be "in amount and with security acceptable to and to be approved by the clerk"; apparently there would be no prohibition against a person signing the person's own bond and depositing required security in cash. 1963-65 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section grants superior courts power to correct errors and grant new trials.</b> Frank v. State, 142 Ga. 741, 83 S.E. 645, 1915D L.R.A. 817, writ of error denied, 235 U.S. 694, 35 S. Ct. 208, 59 L. Ed. 429 (1914) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 70-102, at time when section referred only to superior courts; see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-1). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Superior court of the county in which defendant was convicted of murder had authority, on defendant's motion for new trial, to order an expert evaluation of the defendant, who was incarcerated beyond the boundaries of the county in which the court sat. Zant v. Brantley, 261 Ga. 817, 411 S.E.2d 869 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What constitutes a city court.</b> - Welborne v. State, 114 Ga. 793, 40 S.E. 857 (1902) (decided under former Penal Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 1056).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Municipal courts may hear motions for new trial.</b> - In a dispossessory action, a municipal court erred in holding that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear a motion for new trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-1. The municipal's court enacting legislation, 1983 Ga. Laws 4453-4454, <span class="s1">§</span> 33, as well as Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Para. IV, gave the court such jurisdiction. Nelson v. Powell, 293 Ga. App. 227, 666 S.E.2d 598 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New trials are granted by superior court as a court,</b> not by a presiding judge in the judge's capacity as judge. Allen v. State, 102 Ga. 619, 29 S.E. 470 (1897) (decided under former Penal Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 1056).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New trial may be granted after trial before jury and before appeal.</b> Eufaula Home Ins. Co. v. Plant &amp; Cubbedge, 37 Ga. 672 (1868).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of trial court.</b> - Trial court is vested with discretion in granting new trials. Martin &amp; Sons v. Bank of Leesburg, 137 Ga. 285, 73 S.E. 387 (1911). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When trial judge refuses to order new trial on ground of inadequate damages in tort action, this court will interfere with that discretion only in case of manifest abuse. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant did not rebut the presumption that counsel's conduct was within the broad range of professional conduct, because the trial court considered and rejected counsel's motion for a mistrial, and because an eyewitness could testify about the certainty of the eyewitness's identification, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Greenwood v. State, 309 Ga. App. 893, 714 S.E.2d 602 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certiorari lies though court may grant new trial.</b> - Although city court may have power to grant new trials, it is an inferior court whose final judgments may be reviewed by superior court upon certiorari. Archie v. State, 99 Ga. 23, 25 S.E. 612 (1896). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">First grant of new trial by judge of superior court is never disturbed by appellate court, unless it is made to appear that in doing so the judge manifestly abused the discretion resting in the judge. Law v. Hodges, 53 Ga. App. 319, 185 S.E. 584 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere difference of opinion as to amount of recovery.</b> - New trial should not be granted based on mere difference of opinion between appellate court and jury as to amount of recovery in action of tort for unliquidated damages. Something more must be disclosed to warrant interference, when substantial damages have been returned. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bias, passion, prejudice, or mistake must appear to justify setting aside verdict.</b> - When amount of verdict, though less than appellate court would have approved, does not afford such evidence of bias, passion, prejudice, or mistake as to justify setting the verdict aside as inadequate, the appellate court must affirm the verdict. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption that trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict.</b> - In interpreting language of order overruling motion for new trial, appellate court must presume that trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict devolving upon the judge, and that in overruling motion the judge did exercise this discretion, unless language of order indicates to the contrary and that court agreed to verdict against the court's own judgment and against dictates of the judge's own conscience, merely because the judge did not feel that the judge had the duty or authority to override findings of jury upon disputed issues of fact. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E. 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages rules and new trial rules exist independently.</b> - Rules of law governing (1) right of jury to originally fix damages, (2) right of appellate court to grant new trial when verdict is alleged to be excessive or inadequate, and (3) right of trial judge to grant new trial when in the judge's discretion the judge thinks the verdict unfair, unjust, contrary to evidence, excessive, or too small, exist apart from and independent of each other. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E. 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Approval of verdict necessary to finalize verdict when party moves for new trial on general grounds.</b> - Before verdict becomes final the verdict should, when losing party requires it by motion for new trial, receive approval of mind and conscience of trial judge. Until the judge's approval is given, the verdict does not become binding in a case when motion for new trial contains general grounds. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New trial may be granted on condition that plaintiff refuses to agree to reduction in verdict.</b> Bank of Oglethorpe v. Hicks, 15 Ga. App. 92, 82 S.E. 635 (1914); Carter v. Virginia-Carolina Chem. Co., 144 Ga. 488, 87 S.E. 415 (1915); Biggers v. Mathews, 144 Ga. 857, 88 S.E. 190 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party may be eliminated by order of appellate court, so judgment is against other defendant.</b> Lovell v. Frankum, 24 Ga. App. 261, 100 S.E. 575 (1919).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial cannot be used to withdraw guilty plea.</b> - One who has filed plea of guilty in criminal case cannot move for new trial; neither before nor after sentence can a motion for a new trial be employed as a means of withdrawing a plea of guilty. Bearden v. State, 13 Ga. App. 264, 79 S.E. 79 (1913) (decided under former Penal Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 1083).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of judge's condemnatory language during sentencing.</b> - Disqualification to render judgment on motion for new trial does not result from the judge's use of language condemnatory of the accused when imposing sentence. Harrison v. State, 20 Ga. App. 157, 92 S.E. 970 (1917) (decided under former Penal Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 1083).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restriction on superior court's jurisdiction on appeal from probate proceeding.</b> - When appellant filed a motion in probate court to set aside or amend the probate of a will due to newly discovered evidence of a later will, the probate court properly dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction when the appellant was not a party to the original probate; on appeal, the jurisdiction of the superior court was limited to that of the probate court. In re Lott, 171 Ga. App. 25, 318 S.E.2d 688 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reconsideration of pretrial ruling on immunity.</b> - Appellate court erred by reversing a trial court order granting the defendant a new trial because the trial court had the inherent authority to reconsider the court's pretrial ruling on the defendant's motion for immunity from criminal prosecution under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-3-24.2 and to rule otherwise.

<p class="p4">Legal error is a compound of both error and injury. In absence of either constituent element, the grant of new trial is not warranted. Norris v. Sikes, 102 Ga. App. 609, 117 S.E.2d 214 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Ground of a motion for new trial should be complete within itself, and Supreme Court will not look to other portions of record for purpose of supplementing the record. Gibson v. State, 176 Ga. 384, 168 S.E. 47 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Each special ground of motion for new trial must be complete within itself; and when so incomplete as to require reference to brief of evidence, or to some other portion of record, in order to determine what was alleged error and whether such error was material, ground will not be considered by reviewing court.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When jury charge is based on unconstitutional statute.</b> - Constitutionality of statute cannot be raised for first time in motion for new trial, but when the charge is given to the jury based upon statute which is unconstitutional, and counsel could not know nor anticipate that substance of statute would be given in charge to jury, counsel were not bound to raise question of constitutionality of statute before charge was given, and could assign error upon charge in motion for new trial.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge cannot modify verdict after verdict's receipt and jury's disbursement.</b> - If judge is not satisfied that verdict is returned is proper, before receiving verdict the judge may require the jury to return to room and correct the jury's verdict, under proper instructions from court or, after verdict is received and recorded and jury dispersed, the judge may grant a new trial. But the judge is without power to change and modify verdict after the verdict is received and recorded, and jury has dispersed. Ballard v. Turner, 147 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section furnishes exact rule by which verdict is to be measured;</b> by it a verdict is either right or wrong. Richmond &amp; D.R.R. v. Allison, 89 Ga. 567, 16 S.E. 116 (1892) (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-20).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages rules and new trial rules exist independently.</b> - Rules of law governing (1) right of jury to originally fix damages, (2) right of appellate court to grant new trial when verdict is alleged to be excessive or inadequate, and (3) right of trial judge to grant new trial when in the judge's discretion the judge thinks the verdict "unfair, unjust, contrary to evidence, excessive, or too small," exist apart from and independent of each other. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority to grant new trial.</b> - No court except the trial court is vested by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21 with the authority to grant a new trial in a matter relating to the weight of the evidence. Clark v. State, 249 Ga. App. 97, 547 S.E.2d 734 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of trial judge to exercise discretion.</b> - Motion for new trial on grounds set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-20 or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-21 addresses sound legal discretion of the trial judge and the law imposes upon the judge the duty of exercising this discretion. Kendrick v. Kendrick, 218 Ga. 460, 128 S.E.2d 496 (1962); Ricketts v. Williams, 240 Ga. 148, 240 S.E.2d 41 (1977), vacated on other grounds, 438 U.S. 902, 98 S. Ct. 3119, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1145 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a murder case, the record indicated that, contrary to the defendant's contention, the trial court was aware of and exercised the court's discretion to weigh the evidence in the court's consideration of the defendant's motion for new trial on the general grounds under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21 because the trial court specifically responded that the court would not grant a new trial as the thirteenth juror. Allen v. State, 296 Ga. 738, 770 S.E.2d 625 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of new trial is in trial judge's discretion.</b> - Denial of a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary to the evidence addresses itself only to the discretion of the trial judge. Witt v. State, 157 Ga. App. 564, 278 S.E.2d 145 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as the defendant did not show that the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel because the evidence was so overwhelming against the defendant that there was not a reasonable probability that the subpoena of the witness and the witness's testimony at trial would have produced a different result; in other words, the defendant did not show that the defendant was prejudiced by the alleged deficiency of defense counsel's failure to subpoena a witness. Cain v. State, 277 Ga. 309, 588 S.E.2d 707 (2003), overruled in part by Dickens v. State, 280 Ga. 320, 627 S.E.2d 587 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence supported the defendant's malice murder conviction when the defendant shot the victim because the defendant believed the victim took $400 and the defendant's phone, given that a witness saw the defendant meet the victim at the door of the defendant's house, call the victim a bitch, and yank the victim's arm, then the witness heard a gunshot, and the defendant admitted shooting the victim but claimed it was accidental. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in denying a motion for new trial on general grounds. Smith v. State, 300 Ga. 532, 796 S.E.2d 671 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial addresses only errors of law and fact</b> contributing to rendition of verdict; it does not pertain to motion to vacate judgment. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Eunice, 111 Ga. App. 135, 140 S.E.2d 918 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial must be made before trial court.</b> - Argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence may only be made to a trial court in a motion for new trial and not to the appellate court on appeal as the appellate court has no discretion to grant a new trial based on such a claim. Teele v. State, 319 Ga. App. 448, 738 S.E.2d 277 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standard for considering motion for new trial.</b> - Trial court failed to apply the proper standard of review in considering a motion for new trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-20. A trial court could not grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict on an issue if<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"any evidence" existed to support that issue; by contrast, under <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-20, a trial court could grant a motion for new trial if the verdict was contrary to the evidence. Moore v. Stewart, 315 Ga. App. 388, 727 S.E.2d 159 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court applied incorrect standard.</b> - When faced with a motion for new trial based on general grounds, the trial court had the duty to exercise the court's discretion and weigh the evidence. The trial court did not exercise the court's discretion when the court evaluated the general grounds by applying the standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979) to a motion for new trial based on the general grounds embodied in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21. Walker v. State, 292 Ga. 262, 737 S.E.2d 311 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court failed to apply the proper standard in assessing the weight of the evidence as requested by the defendant in the defendant's motion for new trial, requiring remand for the trial court to apply the proper standard to the general grounds and to exercise the court's discretion to sit as a thirteenth juror pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21. White v. State, 293 Ga. 523, 753 S.E.2d 115 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant as a party of sexual exploitation of children, aggravated sodomy, child molestation, and first degree cruelty to children, the judgment was vacated because the successor judge erred in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial as there was no evidence that the successor judge reviewed the evidence under the appropriate discretionary standard in determining whether the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence or offended the principles of justice and equity. Wiggins v. State, 330 Ga. App. 205, 767 S.E.2d 798 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General ground that verdict is contrary to evidence</b> means verdict lacks evidence to support the verdict. Hardwick v. Georgia Power Co., 100 Ga. App. 38, 110 S.E.2d 24 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Approval of verdict necessary to finalize verdict.</b> - Before verdict becomes final the verdict should, when the losing party requires it by motion for new trial, receive approval of mind and conscience of trial judge. Until the judge's approval is given, the verdict does not become binding in case when motion for new trial contains general grounds. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grounds for new trial known but omitted at time of motion cannot be raised in subsequent petition.</b> - When, in former suit between same parties and relating to same subject matter, verdict was rendered against party, whose motion for new trial was afterwards voluntarily dismissed, a petition subsequently brought by such party to review and set aside verdict is properly dismissed on general demurrer (now motion to dismiss), when it appears that grounds for review were such as were known, or could by reasonable diligence have been discovered in time to incorporate those grounds in motion for new trial made in former case. Hubbard v. Whatley, 200 Ga. 751, 38 S.E.2d 738 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>New trial may be granted without demanding judgment n.o.v.</b> for weight of evidence may be on one side, yet there is some to the contrary. Burnet v. Bazemore, 122 Ga. App. 73, 176 S.E.2d 184 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for judgment n.o.v. may be denied without precluding grant of new trial;</b> for though there may be some evidence in the verdict's favor, the verdict may still be against weight of the evidence. Burnet v. Bazemore, 122 Ga. App. 73, 176 S.E.2d 184 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of new trial on general grounds, unexcepted to, precludes judgment notwithstanding verdict on appeal.</b> - When trial judge denies motion for new trial on general grounds, the judge finds that the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence and therefore, of necessity, that there is evidence to support the verdict. That determination being unexcepted to, the law of the case is established and the appellate court cannot find on motion for judgment n.o.v. that there is no evidence to support the verdict or that the evidence demands a verdict for the movant. Burnet v. Bazemore, 122 Ga. App. 73, 176 S.E.2d 184 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict when some evidence supports verdict.</b> - When there is any evidence supporting the verdict, grounds of motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, that such verdict was contrary to evidence and contrary to principles of justice and equity, merely invoke discretion of trial court on question of whether new trial should be granted on weight of evidence. Crosby Aeromarine, Inc. v. Hyde, 115 Ga. App. 836, 156 S.E.2d 106 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of new trial becomes law of case as to grounds contained in motion.</b> - Absent specific appeal from ruling on motion for new trial or enumerating it as error, denial of motion becomes law of case as to all grounds contained therein.

<p class="p4"><b>New trial properly denied.</b> - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial, as the evidence presented, when coupled with the victim's clear and unfettered identification of the defendant from a photo array, which was not impermissibly suggestive, supported the defendant's convictions, and the defendant failed to show that trial counsel, who had over 30 years of criminal defense experience, was ineffective and that there was a reasonable likelihood that but for the alleged errors, the outcome would have been different.

<p class="p4">Motion for a new trial by one member of the limited liability company (LLC) in an action against other members was properly denied, as resignation by another member from LLC did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty under the LLC's operating agreement or Georgia law; the remaining member failed to show that the members who resigned from the LLC were prohibited from forming a competing business or soliciting customers of the LLC. James E. Warren, M.D., P.C. v. Weber &amp; Warren Anesthesia Servs., 272 Ga. App. 232, 612 S.E.2d 17 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit on a guaranty, the trial court did not err in denying a guarantor's motion for a new trial on general grounds, as the jury's award fell within the range of damages established by the evidence, the guarantor consented to the bank's modification of the terms of one of the loans, and the guarantor failed to demonstrate prejudice by the court's instructions.

<p class="p4">Because the appellant failed to supply the appellate court with the entire trial transcript in the record on appeal, but only included the pretrial motions and the opening statements at trial, without a complete transcript the court of appeals had to presume that the evidence supported the jury's verdict; thus, a new trial was not warranted. Parekh v. Wimpy, 288 Ga. App. 125, 653 S.E.2d 352 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0520, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 319 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied a motion for new trial based on the claim by a dentist and a dental center that a former employee failed to present evidence on the employee's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress that the dentist's actions in harassing the employee were extreme and outrageous or that the emotional distress suffered by the employee was severe; the evidence of the dentist's pervasive pattern of harassing behavior demonstrated the extreme and outrageous nature of the dentist's conduct, and the severity of the emotional distress suffered by the employee was evidenced by the fact that the employee became so fearful of the dentist that the employee obtained a gun and kept the gun under the employee's bed until the employee moved out of state.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying a defendant's motion for a new trial or the defendant's motion for a directed verdict because the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find the defendant guilty of burglary in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-7-1(a) beyond a reasonable doubt where the back window of a home was broken and police found the defendant hiding in a closet under a pile of clothing.

<p class="p4">Although the condemnee claimed that the verdict was contrary to law and the evidence because the Department of Transportation's (DOT) expert failed to give any value to the condemnee's loss of access to approximately 3,800 feet of frontage, the condemnee's claim failed because the record reflected that the expert explained that any access to the DOT bypass along the approximately 3,811 feet of frontage taken along with the 13.022 acres would be limited by the bypass itself and that the condemnee never owned access rights to the bypass. Moreover, the expert explained further that the frontage had been considered in the valuation of the property. RNW Family P'ship, Ltd. v. DOT, 307 Ga. App. 108, 704 S.E.2d 211 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Appellate courts are powerless to interfere with first grant of new trial unless verdict set aside was demanded. Garrett v. Garrett, 128 Ga. App. 594, 197 S.E.2d 739 (1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ruling on motion for new trial under this section or former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 70-206 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-21) does not amount to any ruling on evidence as a matter of law, and as a result, first grant of new trial is not normally reviewable by appellate courts. Ricketts v. Williams, 240 Ga. 148, 240 S.E.2d 41 (1977), vacated on other grounds, 438 U.S. 902, 98 S. Ct. 3119, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1145 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When trial judge discharges duty to review evidence, Supreme Court cannot review factual issues.</b> - When trial judge has discharged the judge's duty to review evidence, the Supreme Court has no power under the Constitution to pass judgment on issues of fact made by evidence. Merritt v. State, 190 Ga. 81, 8 S.E.2d 386 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption that trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict.</b> - In interpreting language of order overruling motion for new trial, the appellate court must presume that the trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict devolving upon the judge, and that in overruling motion the judge did exercise this discretion, unless language of order indicates to contrary and that court agreed to verdict against the judge's own judgment and against dictates of the judge's own conscience, merely because the judge did not feel that the judge had the duty or authority to override findings of the jury upon disputed issues of fact. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Contrary to the defendant's argument, the trial court reviewed the defendant's motion for new trial under the discretionary thirteenth juror standard based on the court's own independent review of the trial record and finding no discrepancy between the jury's conclusions regarding the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses and the court's own views of those matters; moreover, the transcript showed clearly that the court understood the court's obligations as the so-called thirteenth juror. Burney v. State, 299 Ga. 813, 792 S.E.2d 354 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>When there is doubt,</b> appellate courts must decide in favor of verdicts. Branch v. Anderson, 47 Ga. App. 858, 171 S.E. 771 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate court cannot set aside verdict on general grounds trial judge could have relied upon.</b> - In considering case in which verdict of jury has approval of trial judge, the appellate court is without power to set verdict aside on general grounds upon which the trial judge, in exercise of discretion vested in the judge, might have set the verdict aside. Gledhill v. Brown, 44 Ga. App. 670, 162 S.E. 824 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal from denial of new trial on general grounds raises question whether evidence supported verdict.</b> - When appeal is from judgment denying party's motion for new trial and motion is based solely on general grounds, only query for reviewing court is whether evidence supported verdict. Daniels v. Hartley, 120 Ga. App. 294, 170 S.E.2d 315 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Any of general grounds for new trial are addressed to the discretion of the trial judge and on appeal these general grounds pose the sole question, was there any evidence to support verdict. Burnet v. Bazemore, 122 Ga. App. 73, 176 S.E.2d 184 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setting aside verdict on evidentiary grounds.</b> - Court of Appeals can set aside verdict on evidentiary grounds only when totally unsupported. Court of Appeals was established to correct errors of law, and can only set verdict aside, on evidentiary grounds, as being contrary to law, in that the verdict lacks any evidence by which the verdict could be supported. Gledhill v. Brown, 44 Ga. App. 670, 162 S.E. 824 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Verdict of jury which has approval of trial judge will not be set aside by Court of Appeals if the verdict is supported by any evidence. Branch v. Anderson, 47 Ga. App. 858, 171 S.E. 771 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While appellate division of Municipal Court of Atlanta may, as any other court of review, grant a new trial when there is no evidence to support the verdict, since there was some evidence on which the verdict could be based, and such verdict had the approval of the trial judge, the appellate division of the Municipal Court of Atlanta erred in granting a new trial. Turner v. Masonic Relief Ass'n, 52 Ga. App. 374, 183 S.E. 350 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When verdict is supported by some evidence and the verdict has approval of the trial judge, the verdict will not be disturbed by the appellate court as to general grounds of motion for a new trial. Western &amp; Atl. R.R. v. Fowler, 77 Ga. App. 206, 47 S.E.2d 874 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When verdict is supported by some evidence and is approved by the trial court, the Court of Appeals is without authority to interfere. McDowell v. State, 78 Ga.

<p class="p4">Although evidence might authorize different verdict, when there is enough to support verdict found, judgment of trial court refusing new trial on general grounds will not be disturbed. Wright v. State, 76 Ga. App. 483, 46 S.E.2d 516 (1948); Marcus v. State, 76 Ga. App. 581, 46 S.E.2d 770 (1948); Ramer v. State, 76 Ga. App. 678, 47 S.E.2d 174 (1948); Whitfield v. Wheeler, 76 Ga. App. 857, 47 S.E.2d 658 (1948), overruled on other grounds, Caskey v. Underwood, 89 Ga. App. 418, 79 S.E.2d 558 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant could challenge the sufficiency of the evidence</b> by appealing the denial of the defendant's motion for new trial, even though the defendant did not invoke such a ruling from the court at trial. Jones v. State, 219 Ga. App. 780, 466 S.E.2d 667 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because two witnesses heard the defendant threaten to use a gun moments prior to the shooting, and eyewitnesses saw the defendant shoot the victim, the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of malice murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting death of the victim, and the trial court did not err when the court denied the defendant's motion for new trial. Batten v. State, 295 Ga. 442, 761 S.E.2d 70 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of motion for new trial not to be interfered with absent abuse of discretion.</b> - Denial of ordinary motion for new trial, like denial of extraordinary motion, when based upon conflicting evidence, will not be corrected absent abuse of discretion. Sumner v. Sumner, 186 Ga. 390, 197 S.E. 833 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because neither the trial court's order nor the court's statement during the hearing that it was "just going to stick by what the jury did," demonstrated that the court failed to exercise the discretion afforded to the court under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-21 and merely showed the court's manner of expressing that it was exercising the court's discretion against setting aside the jury's verdict. Dixon v. State, 341 Ga. App. 255, 800 S.E.2d 11 (2017). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because sufficient evidence supported the defendant's convictions for arson and aggravated assault based on the testimony of the witnesses who testified that the witnesses could see the defendant starting the fire through the kitchen windows and witnessed the defendant shoot a shotgun in the direction of a neighbor and four law enforcement officers who were at the scene as well as the defendant's admission that the defendant set the fire. Jackson v. State, 347 Ga. App. 199, 818 S.E.2d 268 (2018). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for new trial on general grounds because several codefendants testified that the defendant was a coconspirator and a participant in the victim's robbery, there was evidence that the defendant placed the telephone call to summon the victim, that the defendant was the first to confront the victim, and that the robbery was the defendant's idea. Smith v. State, 350 Ga. App. 336, 829 S.E.2d 408 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of defendant's motion for new trial was reversed</b> as the defendant's right to be present at trial under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XII was violated when the trial court questioned a juror in chambers without defense counsel or the prosecutor present, dismissed the juror, and replaced the juror with an alternate; the defendant did not acquiesce in the illegal proceedings and repudiated counsel's silent waiver of the juror's rights at the juror's first opportunity, the hearing on a motion for a new trial, at which the defendant was represented by new counsel. Sammons v. State, 279 Ga. 386, 612 S.E.2d 785 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the defendant received effective assistance from trial counsel, because the defendant did not waive or abandon the defendant's claims under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, the trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for new trial. Hartley v. State, 299 Ga. App. 534, 683 S.E.2d 109 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the trial court exercised the court's discretion as the thirteenth juror to assess the credibility of at least one witness, the court failed to properly fulfill the court's affirmative statutory duty to independently weigh the trial evidence and identify any offending testimony. It was incumbent upon the trial court to then examine and weigh the remaining evidence and independently consider whether the jury's verdict was contrary to the evidence or was against the weight of the evidence. State v. Reid, 331 Ga. App. 275, 770 S.E.2d 665 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred by denying the appellant's motion for a new trial because the motion hearing transcript clearly showed that the appellant requested the trial court to exercise the court's discretion to review the evidence as a thirteenth juror, but in the court's order denying the motion, the trial court stated that, "The testimony and the other evidence introduced at trial was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt," which was not the proper standard of review. Gomillion v. State, 296 Ga. 678, 769 S.E.2d 914 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial made only the legal determination that the evidence was sufficient under Jackson v. Virginia, and did not show that the successor judge exercised discretion, weighed evidence, and acted as the thirteenth juror in determining whether the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence or offended the principles of justice and equity. Wiggins v. State, 330 Ga. App. 205, 767 S.E.2d 798 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred by denying the defendant's motion for new trial as abandoned instead of ruling on the merits of the defendant's arguments that the verdict of the jury was contrary to evidence and the principles of justice and equity and was contrary to the weight of evidence because counsel's failure to file a brief on the hearsay issues constituted an abandonment of the opportunity to make further argument on those issues rather than the entire motion for new trial. Wilson v. State, 349 Ga. App. 386, 825 S.E.2d 843 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of defendant's motion for new trial upheld.</b> - It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a new trial motion brought by a trustee who was found to have breached the trustee's fiduciary duty to trust beneficiaries by making distributions to a cotrustee under a trust's encroachment provision because the trustee breached the trustee's duty to protect the trust corpus as: (1) the trustee inconsistently required the cotrustee to provide supporting evidence for corpus distributions and let the cotrustee exceed an allotted budget; and (2) the beneficiaries were damaged by the resulting reduction in trust corpus. Reliance Trust Co. v. Candler, 315 Ga. App. 495, 726 S.E.2d 636 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though the trial court did not explicitly cite O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, the language used by the trial court in the court's discretionary determinations that the evidence at trial was not "sufficiently close" to warrant the grant of a new trial as to either the guilt/innocence or the sentencing verdicts indicated that the trial court did in fact exercise the court's discretion under the relevant statutory provisions. Brockman v. State, 292 Ga. 707, 739 S.E.2d 332 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There was no merit to the defendant's claim that a new trial on kidnapping charges was warranted on general grounds because the trial court's statement that the evidence against the defendant was very substantial, the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence, the evidence supported the verdict, and the verdict was not contrary to the evidence showed that the trial court understood the court's discretion and declined to exercise discretion. Alexander v. State, 348 Ga. App. 859, 825 S.E.2d 405 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Incorrect standard applied.</b> - Trial court applied the wrong standard when reviewing the defendant's motion for a new trial based on general grounds, applying the sufficiency of the evidence standard rather than the standard embodied in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21. Atkins v. State, 342 Ga. App. 849, 805 S.E.2d 612 (2017). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court's attention was clearly directed to the court's discretion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, and there was no indication that the court failed to exercise the court's discretion in denying the new trial motion. Wilson v. State, 302 Ga. 106, 805 S.E.2d 98 (2017). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the trial court failed to apply the proper standard when considering the defendant's motion for new trial as the court found that the testimony of the victim and the investigator was sufficient under the Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979) standard, the judgment was vacated and the case was remanded for consideration of the motion for new trial under the proper legal standard. Cook v. State, 351 Ga. App. 845, 833 S.E.2d 544 (2019). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court failed to exercise the court's discretion as the "thirteenth juror" because, rather than reweighing the evidence presented at trial, the court applied a sufficiency-of-evidence standard when the court considered the defendant's motion for new trial on general grounds. Holmes v. State, 306 Ga. 524, 832 S.E.2d 392 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When the evidence supports judgment rendered without jury.</b> - When the evidence is sufficient to support the judgment of the court trying the case by agreement without intervention of the jury, on a motion for new trial, the verdict will not be disturbed by the appellate court. Carter v. State, 77 Ga. App. 60, 47 S.E.2d 815 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Function of appellate court in reviewing verdict.</b> - Barring error by the trial court, the jury's verdict must be upheld unless it can be shown that there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to appellees, and clothing the verdict with all reasonable inferences to be deduced therefrom. Thus, the United States Court of Appeals' sole function is to ascertain if there is a rational basis in the record for the jury's verdict. Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Cohn, 644 F.2d 1040 (5th Cir. 1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial courts have discretion to grant a new trial on the grounds set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, but appellate courts do not. Appellate review is limited to the legal sufficiency of the evidence; even when asked to review a trial court's refusal to grant a new trial on the general grounds, the appellate court must review the case under the sufficiency standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Plez v. State, 300 Ga. 505, 796 S.E.2d 704 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence viewed in light most favorable to upholding verdict.</b> - It is of no consequence on review of the denial of a motion for new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence that the evidence adduced at trial would have authorized a verdict for either party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A reviewing court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to upholding the jury's verdict and any evidence which supports the jury's verdict is sufficient to sustain the trial court's denial of a motion for new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority to grant new trial.</b> - No court except the trial court is vested by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21 with the authority to grant a new trial in a matter relating to the weight of the evidence. Clark v. State, 249 Ga. App. 97, 547 S.E.2d 734 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant claimed on appeal that a conviction for the unauthorized possession of drugs by an inmate, in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-18(b), was contrary to law, contrary to the evidence, and against the weight of the evidence, and that, on that basis, it was error for the trial court to deny a motion for a new trial, but, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-21, only the trial court had the authority to grant a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence.

<p class="p4">Defendant's argument that the verdict convicting the defendant of the involuntary manslaughter of defendant's 17-month-old son was decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence could only be made to a trial court in a motion for new trial, not to an appellate court on appeal.

Appellate review is limited to the legal sufficiency of the evidence; even when asked to review a trial court's refusal to grant a new trial on the general grounds, the appellate court must review the case under the sufficiency standard set forth in Jackson v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New trial motion denied in criminal case.</b> - Evidence was sufficient to support the convictions of murder, aggravated assault, and firearm possession in connection with the shooting death of the victim because the evidence showed that: (1) the defendant's teenage children made a cell phone call to the children's parents' home to tell the parents that the children were being followed by a motorcycle rider; (2) as the children arrived home, the defendant exited from the house with a handgun; (3) the defendant fired two warning shots at the rider when the rider rode past; (4) the rider turned the motorcycle around and when the rider rode past the house again, the defendant fired again as the defendant claimed that the rider swerved toward the defendant; and (5) this shot struck the victim, resulting in the victim's death. Gear v. State, 288 Ga. 500, 705 S.E.2d 632 (2011), overruled on other grounds by State v. Lane, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 98 (Ga. 2020). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because neither the trial court's order nor the court's statement during the hearing that the court was "just going to stick by what the jury did," demonstrated that the court failed to exercise the discretion afforded to it under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-21 and merely showed the court's manner of expressing that the court was exercising the court's discretion against setting aside the jury's verdict. Dixon v. State, 341 Ga. App. 255, 800 S.E.2d 11 (2017). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellate court had no basis for disturbing the trial court's exercise of discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because the order reflected that the trial court performed the court's duty using the proper legal standard. Lundy v. State, 341 Ga. App. 767, 801 S.E.2d 629 (2017). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because sufficient evidence supported the defendant's convictions for arson and aggravated assault based on the testimony of the witnesses who testified that the witnesses could see the defendant starting the fire through the kitchen windows and witnessed the defendant shoot a shotgun in the direction of a neighbor and four law enforcement officers who were at the scene as well as the defendant's admission that the defendant set the fire. Jackson v. State, 347 Ga. App. 199, 818 S.E.2d 268 (2018). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred by denying the defendant's motion for new trial as abandoned instead of ruling on the merits of the defendant's arguments that the verdict of the jury was contrary to evidence and the principles of justice and equity and was contrary to the weight of evidence because counsel's failure to file a brief on the hearsay issues constituted an abandonment of the opportunity to make further argument on those issues rather than the entire motion for new trial. Wilson v. State, 349 Ga. App. 386, 825 S.E.2d 843 (2019). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for new trial on general grounds because several codefendants testified that the defendant was a coconspirator and a participant in the victim's robbery, there was evidence that the defendant placed the telephone call to summon the victim, that the defendant was the first to confront the victim, and that the robbery was the defendant's idea.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illustrative cases.</b> - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial despite defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence to prove the identity and value of the items which defendant shoplifted, as there was sufficient evidence to prove the identity and value of the items given that: (1) a store manager saw defendant place items from the manager's store into the trunk of defendant's car and identified defendant in a showup identification less than 30 minutes later, after the defendant was stopped for shoplifting at a second store; (2) the manager from the first store identified a number of items that were found in the defendant's trunk as coming from the first store based on the store code markings on the items; and (3) the packages contained pricing labels. Horne v. State, 260 Ga. App. 640, 580 S.E.2d 644 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a condemnee did not claim lost profits or business losses, the trial court properly limited the condemnee's evidence to the value of the property taken and consequential damages to the remainder; because the jury's valuation was within the range of the evidence, the trial court properly denied the condemnee's motion for a new trial. Thornton v. DOT, 275 Ga. App. 401, 620 S.E.2d 621 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit on a guaranty, the trial court did not err in denying a guarantor's motion for a new trial on general grounds, as the jury's award fell within the range of damages established by the evidence, the guarantor consented to the bank's modification of the terms of one of the loans, and the guarantor failed to demonstrate prejudice by the court's instructions. Beasley v. Wachovia Bank, 277 Ga. App. 698, 627 S.E.2d 417 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although defendant received effective assistance from trial counsel, because defendant did not waive or abandon defendant's claims under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for new trial. Hartley v. State, 299 Ga. App. 534, 683 S.E.2d 109 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in refusing to grant the defendant's motion for a new trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-21 because the evidence establishing that the defendant and the victims had engaged in a heated argument, which escalated to preparations for a physical altercation, was sufficient to sustain the defendant's voluntary manslaughter conviction, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-5-2(a); given the heated exchange and the defendant's belief that the defendant was in serious danger, there was sufficient provocation to excite the passion necessary for voluntary manslaughter, and the jury was authorized to reject the defendant's claim of self-defense under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-3-21(a) and conclude that the defendant was so influenced and excited that the defendant reacted passionately, rather than simply in self defense, when the defendant shot an unarmed victim. White v. State, 312 Ga. App. 421, 718 S.E.2d 335 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court was aware of the court's responsibility as the "thirteenth juror" and, despite the court's mention of the sufficiency of the evidence at trial, the court exercised the court's discretion accordingly when denying the defendant's motion for a new trial after citing personal observations of witnesses and evidence at trial. Perdue v. State, 298 Ga. 841, 785 S.E.2d 291 (2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court failed to exercise the court's discretion as the "thirteenth juror" because, rather than reweighing the evidence presented at trial, the court applied a sufficiency-of-evidence standard when the court considered the defendant's motion for new trial on general grounds. Holmes v. State, 306 Ga. 524, 832 S.E.2d 392 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of motion for new trial improper.</b> - Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial made only the legal determination that the evidence was sufficient under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), and did not show that the successor judge exercised discretion, weighed evidence, and acted as the thirteenth juror in determining whether the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence or offended the principles of justice and equity. Wiggins v. State, 330 Ga. App. 205, 767 S.E.2d 798 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred by denying the appellant's motion for a new trial because the motion hearing transcript clearly showed that the appellant requested the trial court to exercise the court's discretion to review the evidence as a thirteenth juror, but in the court's order denying the motion, the trial court stated that, "The testimony and the other evidence introduced at trial was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt," which was not the proper standard of review.

<p class="p4"><b>If evidence is admissible for any purpose, the admission of that evidence will not cause a new trial.</b> West v. West, 199 Ga. 378, 34 S.E.2d 545 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Test as to whether illegal evidence warrants new trial.</b> - Error of admitting illegal evidence must be such as induced or largely contributed to erroneous finding, and such error that if new trial is granted, result should in all probability be different on another trial. Daughtry v. Savannah &amp; S. Ry., 1 Ga. App. 393, 58 S.E. 230 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When evidence of guilt is overwhelming.</b> - When evidence is overwhelming that the defendant is guilty, even errors in admission or rejection of testimony will not operate so as to require new trial. Brannon v. State, 21 Ga. App. 328, 94 S.E. 259 (1917). But see Thigpen v. Batts, 199 Ga. 161, 33 S.E.2d 424 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When evidence rejected relates to matter collateral to main transaction, and evidence touching main transaction makes a clear case of guilt, rejection of such evidence does not in all cases require grant of new trial. Green v. State, 154 Ga. 117, 113 S.E. 536 (1922).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ruling upon admissibility of testimony may be reversed by motion for new trial.</b> Eaves v. Field &amp; Son, 8 Ga. App. 69, 68 S.E. 556 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admission of illegal testimony on one side will not justify illegal rebutting testimony on other.</b> Two wrongs do not make a right. Housing Auth. v. Kolokuris, 110 Ga. App. 869, 140 S.E.2d 239 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence not conforming to pleadings, admitted without objection.</b> - Although pleadings may not present whole issue, if it is fully made by evidence without objection, it is too late, after verdict, for losing party, to make that the ground of a motion for new trial. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Hale, 47 Ga. App. 674, 171 S.E. 306 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of the evidence.</b> - Because an accomplice's testimony was corroborated by defendant's recent possession of a stolen boat as well as defendant's flight from the scene of the crime, the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of theft by taking; consequently, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial. Johnson v. State, 275 Ga. App. 161, 620 S.E.2d 433 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There was sufficient evidence to support a defendant's conviction for felony murder of the love interest of the defendant's spouse, and the trial court did not err by denying the defendant's motions for a directed verdict or for a new trial; the trial court properly concluded that the defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial based on the testimony of a state psychiatrist who determined that the defendant had some intellectual limitations and a problem with literacy, but found the defendant capable of rational and logical discussion about the circumstances of the incident to be tried, was capable of assisting in the defense, and understood the nature and object of the legal proceedings. The trial court also did not err by refusing the defendant's requested jury charges as the charges either did not relate to the evidence or the charge given was all that was necessary. Velazquez v. State, 282 Ga. 871, 655 S.E.2d 806 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inadmissible testimony given on cross examination that is unresponsive to the question.</b> - While answer that is responsive to question on cross-examination will not be ruled out although it would otherwise have been inadmissible as evidence, testimony that is inadmissible, which is given on cross-examination but is not responsive to question, should be ruled out; and it is error to overrule the motion to exclude it. Mickle v. Moore, 188 Ga. 444, 4 S.E.2d 217 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admission of character evidence.</b> - Because evidence of defendant's gang membership was admissible both as part of the res gestae of the crime and to show motive, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motions in limine and for a new trial, even though the evidence implicated defendant's character. Garibay v. State, 275 Ga. App. 170, 620 S.E.2d 424 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial after an investigating officer testified on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cross- <br>
examination that the defendant gave the officer a statement right after the defendant had talked with the defendant's parole officer because the testimony followed defense counsel's question regarding the content, not the timing, of the defendant's statement; a passing reference to a defendant's record does not place his or her character in evidence, and a nonresponsive answer that impacts negatively on a defendant's character does not improperly place his or her character in issue. Lanier v. State, 288 Ga. 109, 702 S.E.2d 141 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Similar transaction evidence.</b> - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial, challenging the admission of similar transaction evidence, because the similar transaction evidence properly corroborated the identity, intent, and course of conduct defendant engaged in with regard to two other home invasions with several other perpetrators that also included the rape of a victim. Grier v. State, 290 Ga. App. 59, 658 S.E.2d 827 (2008), overruled on other grounds by State v. Lane, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 98 (Ga. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admission of telephone conversation between defendant and mother.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial, which was based on the admission of a recorded telephone conversation between the defendant and defendant's mother, who stated "because it's on your record," in response to why the defendant could not be disappointed if the defendant was denied bond; the comment was fleeting and was not a direct comment about the defendant's criminal history, and the mother did not comment on the content of the defendant's criminal record or even say, with certainty, that one did or did not exist. Hamrick v. State, 304 Ga. App. 378, 696 S.E.2d 403 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Alleged prosecutorial misconduct.</b> - Because a prosecutor's comments were directed at defense counsel's failure to rebut or explain the state's evidence and the prosecutor made a permissible analogy, there was no prosecutorial misconduct; consequently, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial. Duffy v. State, 271 Ga. App. 668, 610 S.E.2d 620 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disposition of case on diminished record.</b> - Trial court may not on motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict eliminate evidence on the ground that the evidence was improperly received at the trial and then dispose of the case on the basis of the diminished record. Mays v. Daniels, 179 Ga. App. 677, 347 S.E.2d 642 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Coindictee's statement on polygraph examination.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by declining to declare a mistrial when a coindictee testified that the coindictee had taken a polygraph examination because the trial court's prompt curative instructions to the jury to disregard the coindictee's statement was sufficient to prevent the testimony from having any prejudicial impact; it was highly improbable that the coindictee's remarks influenced the outcome of the case, in view of the strong weight of the evidence against the defendant. Gandy v. State, 290 Ga. 166, 718 S.E.2d 287 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admission of statement given after waiver of right to counsel.</b> - Trial court did not err by admitting the defendant's custodial statement to a police detective because after the defendant invoked the right to counsel, the detective ceased the interrogation and was returning the defendant to jail when the defendant told the detective that the defendant would tell the detective what the detective wanted to know and then gave an incriminating statement upon returning to the room where the interrogation was conducted. Anthony v. State, 315 Ga. App. 701, 727 S.E.2d 528 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unredacted recording of phone conversation should have been admitted.</b> - Trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the court committed harmful error when the court prevented the defendant from playing to the jury an unredacted recording of a phone conversation between a witness and a friend; the witness was essentially acting as an informant, or at least an agent of police investigators, at the time of the phone conversation, and thus, the witness's recorded statements were admissible as original evidence pursuant to former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-3-2 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-8-801). Redinburg v. State, 315 Ga. App. 413, 727 S.E.2d 201 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial properly denied.</b> - Because the police officers saw a vehicle matching a dispatcher's description shortly after receiving the dispatch, and the vehicle attempted to elude the officers, in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-6-395(a), the officers had a specific and articulable reason to stop the vehicle; consequently, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motions to suppress, in limine, and for a new trial. Francis v. State, 275 Ga. App. 164, 620 S.E.2d 431 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err by denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial after the jurors watched a portion of the defendant's videotaped statement, which the jurors were not supposed to view, because the jurors clearly indicated that the jurors could and would follow the trial court's curative instruction. Alatise v. State, 291 Ga. 428, 728 S.E.2d 592 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Eiberger v. Martel Elec. Sales, Inc., 125 Ga. App. 253, 187 S.E.2d 327 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it was error for a trial court to rule that a prior inconsistent statement needed to be authenticated before statement could be used for impeachment, that error was harmless due to the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt; defendant was properly denied a new trial on defendant's conviction for aggravated child molestation. Also, while it was error to exclude a prior inconsistent statement by another witness, the fact that the defendant was able to vigorously examine the witness on the statement and the fact that the contents of the statement were made known to the jury rendered that error harmless. Robinson v. State, 265 Ga. App. 481, 594 S.E.2d 696 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the trial court erred by denying the defendant's motion in limine, by overruling defendant's objection on hearsay grounds, and by overruling defense counsel's objections to the prosecution's improper character evidence, it was highly probable that the errors did not contribute to the judgment convicting the defendant of trafficking in cocaine; therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Williams v. State, 312 Ga. App. 693, 719 S.E.2d 501 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial on the ground that an eyewitness's testimony was based on hearsay because to the extent the testimony exposed prior difficulties between the codefendants and the victim, it was cumulative of other testimony that the defendant and the codefendant threatened the victim the day before the shooting; the other evidence implicating the defendant in the shooting made it highly probable that the hearsay testimony did not contribute to the verdict.

<p class="p4"><b>Admission of immaterial evidence not reversible error.</b> - It is not reversible error to admit evidence that is merely irrelevant and immaterial. Mickle v.

<p class="p4">Rejection of testimony, admissible or inadmissible, which has no probative value whatever, or admitting legal testimony which is wholly immaterial, is not sufficient cause for granting a new trial. Because testimony has been inadvertently admitted, which is wholly immaterial, and which it is apparent could have helped neither party, a new trial will hardly be awarded in an important case. Weeks v. State, 79 Ga. 36, 3 S.E. 323 (1887). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Corrective instructions to rule out illegal testimony.</b> - Ordinarily, when illegal testimony is placed in evidence, it is not an abuse of discretion to refuse to grant a mistrial if sufficient corrective instructions are given in ruling out the testimony. This is true even if the illegal testimony has the effect of placing the defendant's character in issue, especially when the testimony is volunteered by the witness and not directly elicited by the solicitor. Witt v. State, 157 Ga. App. 564, 278 S.E.2d 145 (1981); Glenridge Unit Owners Ass'n v. Felton, 183 Ga. App. 858, 360 S.E.2d 418 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Erroneous admission of evidence over objection not reversible error.</b> - When certain evidence is admitted over objection, but similar evidence to the same effect is admitted without objection, admission of evidence objected to will not constitute reversible error, even if admission of evidence was erroneous. Louisville &amp; N.R.R. v. McCamy, 72 Ga. App. 769, 35 S.E.2d 206 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When jury considers evidence on same subject matter, admitted without objection, it is not harmful error to allow the same evidence again admitted, over objections, since the admission would probably not change the result.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of ruling out illegally admitted evidence.</b> - As a general rule, error in admitting illegal evidence is cured by subsequently ruling the evidence out. This rule, however, is subject to exception; for when illegal evidence may have worked such harm or injury to accused as to render it probable that the subsequent withdrawal of the evidence will not heal the injury inflicted by the improper admission, error is sufficient ground for grant of a new trial.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inadvertent reference to insurance in personal injury action did not warrant new trial.</b> - Because the trial judge took the appropriate curative steps in denying an opposing driver's motions for both a mistrial and a new trial after the suing driver made an inadvertent reference to insurance, including rebuking the suing driver and issuing a curative instruction, the court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the opposing driver's motions; moreover, the appeals court could not conclude that the opposing driver suffered any wrong or oppression as a result of the trial court's orders. Defusco v. Free, 287 Ga. App. 313, 651 S.E.2d 458 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Previously withheld exculpatory information.</b> - If exculpatory information is withheld from a defendant prior to trial (after a proper motion to release all such evidence), but is later introduced at trial by the state, the defendant is not entitled to a mistrial unless the defendant shows that the defendant's defense was thereby prejudiced and that the defendant was denied a fair trial. Edwards v. State, 176 Ga. App. 369, 337 S.E.2d 27 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>False evidence allegation did not warrant new trial.</b> - Although the defendant contended that along with the revocation of defendant's codefendant's plea deal after the codefendant made statements in contradiction of the plea hearing testimony and defendant's assertion that the defendant refused to give false testimony to the prosecutor in exchange for a plea deal, proved that the prosecutor knowingly allowed false evidence to be presented to the jury in violation of due process, the trial court did not err when the court did not credit the motion for new trial testimony; since the defendant's codefendant was not privy to what occurred in the house after the codefendant ran out and the defendant did not present any evidence at trial that the defendant's codefendant's testimony was false, the revocation of the codefendant's plea deal was inapposite as was defendant's rejection of the plea deal offer. Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding there was no misconduct warranting a new trial pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-22. Cooper v. State, 287 Ga. 861, 700 S.E.2d 593 (2010), overruled on other grounds, Smith v. State, 290 Ga. 768, 723 S.E.2d 915 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Expert testimony.</b> - Trial court erred in admitting, over objection, the testimony of the parents' expert witness about the standard of care in the day-care industry regarding the handling of infants in a case when the infant of the parents died at a hospital after being found pale at the infant's day-care center; the correct standard was that of the average parent, the jury did not need expert testimony to understand or apply that standard of care, and the expert's testimony confused the jury. Accordingly, the child-day care center was granted a new trial because the error in admitting the expert testimony was not harmless. Applebrook Country Dayschool, Inc. v. Thurman, 264 Ga. App. 591, 591 S.E.2d 406 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial after one of the state's expert witnesses testified about a medical examination the expert made of the victim that was not reflected in the records the state produced before trial because the doctors who examined the victim shortly after the victim had been injured testified to finding cell death in portions of the victim's brain, resulting in irreversible brain damage; the expert's testimony that the later examination also indicated a permanent brain injury was cumulative of the other medical evidence. Eskew v. State, 309 Ga. App. 44, 709 S.E.2d 893 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testimony regarding codefendant's statement.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial because the defendant did not show any harm resulting from the investigating police officers' testimony regarding the codefendant's statement, which referenced an "individual" with the codefendant on the night of the robbery who could be considered references to a person whom the jury could infer to be the defendant; the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. Anderson v. State, 311 Ga. App. 732, 716 S.E.2d 813 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interview notes not produced.</b> - Assuming that notes of an interview that was suppressed by the state were evidence favorable to the defendant, the defendant failed to show either that the notes were not available to the defendant through reasonable diligence, or that the course of the defendant's trial would have been any different had the notes been produced. Thus, there was no error in the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for a new trial based upon a Brady violation. Freeman v. State, 284 Ga. 830, 672 S.E.2d 644 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of arrest on another charge admissible.</b> - Defendant was not denied a fair trial when the jury was allowed to hear evidence of an unrelated arrest because the circumstances of the defendant's arrest for obstruction of, and giving false information to, an officer were admissible as evidence of flight. Durham v. State, 309 Ga. App. 444, 710 S.E.2d 644 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remedial charge sufficient to remedy error.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial because a remedial charge, which repeatedly admonished the jury that an accomplice's guilty plea was not to be considered in any way with respect to the defendant's guilt, was sufficient to remedy the error of the admission of the plea and render a mistrial unnecessary.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial after the state elicited hearsay testimony because the trial court took sufficient precautions to exclude the inadmissible evidence from the jury's consideration as evidence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Harmful Brady violation.</b> - Trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the state committed a harmful Brady violation when the state failed to turn over to the defense a written statement that the victim gave to police; the victim's impeachable omission was not known to the defense before or during trial, and the victim's statement was material to the defense since had the statement been disclosed, the outcome of the case could have been different.

<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff in error must show that the plaintiff was harmed and prejudiced by ruling complained of.</b> - In order for court to grant new trial because of alleged error in introduction of evidence, upon direct exception to this court, it is incumbent upon plaintiff in error to show affirmatively in bill of exceptions, that the plaintiff was harmed and prejudiced by such ruling; and when there is no brief of evidence before this court, and it is not made to appear from bill of exceptions but that there was other evidence before the jury upon same subject, the plaintiff in error fails to show error requiring grant of a new trial in erroneous introduction of such evidence.

<p class="p4">Complaint in ground of motion for new trial of ruling admitting or excluding as evidence a paper, which does not set forth the paper literally or in substance in the ground itself or as an exhibit thereto properly identified, is insufficient to present any question for decision by the Supreme Court on a bill of exceptions assigning error on a judgment refusing a new trial.

<p class="p4"><b>New trial granted based on error in jury charge.</b> - In a condemnation action, the lessee was entitled to a new trial because the trial court erred in the court's charge to the jury regarding lost profits; the jury instructions misstated the law and, when considered in the context of the charge as a whole, rendered the charge confusing, contradictory, and unreconcilable.

<p class="p4"><b>Policy of law to end litigation must yield to supreme object of achieving full justice.</b> - Despite often-stated policy of law to end litigation, for which reason courts ordinarily look with disfavor upon grants of new trial upon newly discovered evidence, this policy of law must and does yield to higher and supreme object of law which is to do full justice in all cases. Matthews v. Grace, 199 Ga. 400, 34 S.E.2d 454 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for grant of new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</b> - To obtain a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, a movant must satisfy the court: (1) that the evidence has come to the movant's knowledge since the trial; (2) that it was not owing to the want of due diligence that the movant did not acquire the evidence sooner; (3) that the evidence is so material that it would probably produce a different verdict; (4) that the evidence is not cumulative only; (5) that the affidavit of the witness is attached to the motion or the affidavit's absence accounted for; and (6) that the new evidence does not operate solely to impeach the credibility of a witness. All six requirements must be satisfied before a new trial will be granted. Young v. State, 194 Ga. App. 335, 390 S.E.2d 305 (1990); Eliopulos v. State, 203 Ga. App. 262, 416 S.E.2d 745, cert. denied, 203 Ga. App. 906, 416 S.E.2d 745 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Requirements for grant of new trial based on newly discovered evidence are: (1) that evidence has come to knowledge of moving party since trial; (2) that it was not owing to want of due diligence that moving party did not acquire the evidence sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would probably produce a different verdict; and (4) that it is not cumulative only. Turner v. State, 139 Ga. App. 503, 229 S.E.2d 23 (1976); Jefferson v. State, 157 Ga. App. 324, 277 S.E.2d 317 (1981); Blankenship v. State, 162 Ga. App. 538, 292 S.E.2d 123 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is incumbent on party who asks for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence to satisfy court: (1) that evidence has come to the party's knowledge since trial; (2) that it was not owing to want of due diligence that the party did not acquire it sooner; (3) that the evidence is so material that it would probably produce a different verdict; (4) that the evidence is not cumulative only; (5) that affidavit of witness should be procured or the affidavit's absence accounted for; and (6) that new trial will not be granted if only effect of evidence will be to impeach credit of witness. Benefield v. State, 140 Ga. App. 727, 232 S.E.2d 89 (1976); Timberlake v. State, 246 Ga. 488, 271 S.E.2d 792 (1980); Allanson v. State, 158 Ga. App. 77, 279 S.E.2d 316 (1981); Alexander v.

<p class="p4">In motion for new trial made upon alleged newly discovered evidence, when it appears that latter is purely cumulative, and it does not appear that with additional evidence a verdict different from that already rendered would probably result, and when it further appears that the defendant and defense counsel could, by exercise of slightest diligence, have discovered such evidence before or at time of trial, this court will not hold that trial judge abused the judge's discretion in overruling motion. Stargel v. State, 52 Ga. App. 74, 182 S.E. 406 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To obtain a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, the evidence supporting the motion must be admissible, and must also satisfy six criteria: (1) it must have been discovered after the trial or hearing; (2) its late discovery was not due to lack of diligence; (3) it is so material that its introduction in evidence would probably produce a different result; (4) it is not cumulative only; (5) the affidavit of the witness must be attached to the motion (or its absence accounted for); and (6) it does not operate only to impeach a witness.

<p class="p4"><b>Post-trial declaration.</b> - Law is settled that a post-trial declaration by a state's witness that the witness's former testimony was false is not a ground for a new trial. Brown v. State, 209 Ga. App. 314, 433 S.E.2d 321 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Although a codefendant who testified against the defendant at defendant's criminal trial indicated that a certain sentence was recommended by the prosecutor's office, and thereafter, a much more lenient sentence was actually imposed on that codefendant, the defendant failed to show that the state committed a Brady violation by not disclosing the more favorable deal that the state made with the testifying codefendant as the prosecutor testified that the codefendant had testified accurately as to the sentence recommendation, but that the sheriff's office had sought a more lenient sentence for the defendant, which was in fact imposed; accordingly, the defendant's new trial motion was properly denied and the convictions were properly affirmed. Ford v. State, 273 Ga. App. 290, 614 S.E.2d 907 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When all requirements are met, grant of new trial is mandatory.</b> - While section states that new trial may be granted, in proper case, when all rules of law have been met, new trial must be granted. Matthews v. Grace, 199 Ga. 400, 34 S.E.2d 454 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">All six requirements must be complied with to secure a new trial. Westbrook v. State, 186 Ga. App. 493, 368 S.E.2d 131, cert. denied, 186 Ga. App. 919, 368 S.E.2d 131 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of noncompliance with section's requirements.</b> - When requirements of section are not complied with, it is not error to overrule ground of motion for new trial based upon evidence alleged to be newly discovered, which might produce a different result should a new trial be granted. Blackwell v. Houston County, 168 Ga. 248, 147 S.E. 574 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Motions for new trials based upon newly discovered evidence are not favored. Norman v. Goode, 121 Ga. 449, 49 S.E. 268 (1904); Harris v.

<p class="p4"><b>Great caution should be exercised</b> in granting new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence. Gates v. State, 84 Ga. App. 367, 66 S.E.2d 342 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When severance not mandatory, denial of new trial not error.</b> - When defendant's trial counsel did not move to sever defendant's two aggravated assault charges, which were similar in fact pattern and would have presumably been admitted in the trial of the other, it was found that severance was not mandatory and the defendant did not show prejudice as a result of the decision to not so move. The trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to seek severance of the charges. Collier v. State, 266 Ga. App. 345, 596 S.E.2d 795 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasons that new trials under section are not favored.</b> - Generally, granting of new trials on newly discovered evidence is not favored, because it tends to discourage diligence and encourage lack of diligence by litigants and their counsel on the first trial, causes delay in administering of justice, and loss of time, labor, and expense of another trial. Turner v. State, 44 Ga. App. 348, 161 S.E. 626 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Motions for new trial are not intended to serve purpose of cross-examination.</b> Greer &amp; Co. v. Raney, 120 Ga. 290, 47 S.E. 939 (1904); Bullington v. Chandler, 110 Ga. App. 803, 140 S.E.2d 59 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of judge.</b> - Motion must be addressed to the sound legal discretion of court, and the court alone must be trier of weight and credibility of testimony. Morgan v. State, 16 Ga. App. 559, 85 S.E. 827 (1915). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Motions for new trial under section are addressed to the sound discretion of the judge. Aycock v. State, 188 Ga. 550, 4 S.E.2d 221 (1939); Herrin v. State, 71 Ga.

<p class="p4">Grant or denial of motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence is largely discretionary with trial judge. James v. State, 115 Ga. App. 822, 156 S.E.2d 183 (1967). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Applications for new trial are in large part addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. Allanson v. State, 158 Ga. App. 77, 279 S.E.2d 316 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Motions for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence are addressed to the sole discretion of the trial judge, which will not be controlled unless abused. Blankenship v. State, 162 Ga. App. 538, 292 S.E.2d 123 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Grant or denial of a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is a decision within the sound discretion of the trial court. The court's ruling will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion. Wilson v. State, 193 Ga. App. 374, 387 S.E.2d 642 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a situation in which a juror did not admit during voir dire that the juror knew the victim, but during trial, the juror indicated that the juror was unaware of the victim's name but that the juror knew the victim, but in fact, the victim had worked in the juror's shop years earlier, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as the juror indicated that the juror would be fair and impartial, the juror had not been dishonest, but merely mistaken, during voir dire, and the trial court was within the court's discretion because a corrected response by the juror during voir dire would not have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Todd v. State, 275 Ga. App. 459, 620 S.E.2d 666 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Strict rules.</b> - Extraordinary motions for new trials, based solely upon ground of newly discovered evidence, are viewed by courts with even less favor than original motions based on such ground, a stricter rule being applied to the former. Norman v. Goode, 121 Ga. 449, 49 S.E. 268 (1904); Jackson v. State, 50 Ga. App. 243, 177 S.E. 819 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Hamilton v. State, 119 Ga. App. 196, 166 S.E.2d 735 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Denial of defendant's extraordinary motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was upheld after the defendant failed to show, inter alia, that the allegedly new evidence came to the defendant's knowledge after trial or that the delay in acquiring the evidence was not the result of lack of due diligence.

<p class="p4">Denial of defendant's motion for a new trial after the defendant's conviction for burglary and theft by receiving was not error, as defendant's alleged newly-discovered evidence would have been known prior to trial; the defendant knew of a witness' immediate presence during a conversation regarding stolen goods and, therefore, would have known prior to trial that the witness could have testified to the conversation.

<p class="p4"><b>Must contain certified copy of evidence adduced upon trial.</b> - When accused has been convicted, a new trial denied the accused, and that judgment affirmed, in order for extraordinary motion for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence to be a valid motion, it must appear that newly discovered evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, and that newly discovered evidence would likely produce a different result. As none of these requirements can be determined without an examination of evidence adduced upon original trial of case, an extraordinary motion for new trial that does not contain a certified copy of evidence adduced upon original trial is not a good motion and can be denied upon this ground alone.

<p class="p4"><b>Claim of innocence in habeas petition was not a constitutional claim.</b> - Petitioner, a death row inmate, argued in the petitioner's federal habeas petition as a separate claim for relief that the petitioner was actually innocent, but that claim failed because actual innocence was not itself a constitutional claim, and was instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner had to pass to have an otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits; further, the claim was not properly before the federal court, as the petitioner could pursue a claim of actual innocence in state court by filing an extraordinary motion for new trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-23, 5-5-40, and 5-5-41.

<p class="p4"><b>Filing of extraordinary motion not affected by notice of appeal.</b> - While it is elementary that after notice of appeal has been filed to judgment of trial court, judge no longer has jurisdiction to reconsider and change it, this has no bearing on extraordinary motions filed under this section.

<p class="p4"><b>Trial court did not abuse discretion in granting extraordinary motion for new trial.</b> - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs' extraordinary motion for new trial based on an auto company's misleading discovery responses with regard to liability insurance because they acted with due diligence to raise their claim that the jury should have been qualified as to the auto company's insurers and the failure to do so raised an unrebutted presumption that they were materially harmed.

<p class="p4">Corporate defendant, in a negligence and product liability action, was not entitled to a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the jury was properly charged that each individual tortfeasor's conduct did not have to constitute a substantial contributing factor in the plaintiff's injury in order to be considered a proximate cause thereof. John Crane, Inc. v. Jones, 278 Ga. 747, 604 S.E.2d 822 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's claim that a trial court improperly denied a motion for new trial and for extraordinary new trial, based on Brady violations by the state in failing to apprise defendant that a lab technician who had run tests on defendant's blood for the presence of alcohol had switched other test samples on two prior occasions, lacked merit; even if most of the elements of a Brady violation were shown, defendant was not deprived of a fair trial because there was no reasonable possibility that the outcome of the trial would have been different because blood taken by hospital personnel also indicated that alcohol was present. Verlangieri v. State, 273 Ga. App. 585, 615 S.E.2d 633 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's aggravated stalking conviction was upheld on appeal, and a new trial was properly denied, as sufficient evidence of the defendant's contact with the victim, in violation of a protective order, and acts of harassment and intimidation supported the conviction; moreover, the failure to object to the state's of similar transaction evidence waived any consideration of the evidence on appeal. Kennedy v. State, 279 Ga. App. 415, 631 S.E.2d 462 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence with regard to the defendant's conviction for the murder of the defendant's mother as the purported newly discovered evidence that another man with whom the defendant had used cocaine with on the day of the murder killed the defendant's mother after learning that the mother had a large sum of cash in the home in preparation for a trip, was part of the defendant's defense, and was vigorously advanced at trial; the reviewing court found no error after concluding that the newly discovered evidence would not have reasonably produced a different result. Hester v. State, 282 Ga. 239, 647 S.E.2d 60 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied defendants' motions to suppress and for new trial with regard to the defendants' convictions for drug possession and trafficking based on obtaining allegedly new evidence that a stopping officer failed to run a computer check of one defendant's driver's license, as that officer had indicated, because there was no showing that defendants exercised due diligence in obtaining the additional evidence. In fact, the reason defense counsel provided for not obtaining the evidence sooner was a failure to believe that the computer check of the license was going to be a key issue. Woodard v. State, 289 Ga. App. 643, 658 S.E.2d 129 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1061, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 475 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence where bystander's existence was known by defense prior to trial; moreover, as the bystander's claim that defendant had no gun was contradicted by three bystanders and a victim, it did not appear that evidence would have produced a different verdict. Banks v. State, 290 Ga. App. 887, 660 S.E.2d 873 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence because the defendant failed to establish that the new evidence attacked the creditability of a witness; credibility is attacked by showing that the pending charges and their dismissal reveal a possible bias, prejudice, or ulterior motive on behalf of the witness to give untruthful or shaded testimony in an effort to please the state and not merely to testify in accordance with the state's theory of the case. Delgiudice v. State, 308 Ga. App. 397, 707 S.E.2d 603 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Decision denying the defendant's motion for a new trial was proper, in light of the strength of the evidence that the defendant committed the charged offenses, including fingerprint evidence; it could not be concluded that new DNA evidence excluding the defendant as the donor of a semen sample recovered from a victim was so material that the DNA evidence warranted a new trial. Wright v. State, 310 Ga. App. 80, 712 S.E.2d 105 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's extraordinary motion for a new trial as the defendant could have moved to conduct DNA testing prior to trial and would have discovered that DNA on the gloves did not match the defendant, but rather the codefendant, and the defendant was thus unable to show that the delay in obtaining evidence was not caused by a lack of due diligence as required in an extraordinary motion for new trial. Bharadia v. State, 326 Ga. App. 827, 755 S.E.2d 273 (2014), aff'd, 297 Ga. 567, 774 S.E.2d 90 (Ga. 2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge shall determine credibility of conflicting facts and contradictory witnesses.</b> - Upon hearing of motion for new trial, based upon newly discovered evidence, when affidavits are introduced supporting and disputing ground of motion, the trial judge is trier of facts, and it is the judge's province to determine credibility of conflicting facts and contradictory witnesses. Herrin v. State, 71 Ga. App. 384, 31 S.E.2d 124 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court must consider alleged newly discovered evidence in comparison with evidence adduced at trial.</b> - Under motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, trial court and appellate court are necessarily required to consider alleged newly discovered evidence in light of and in comparison with evidence adduced at trial, and on which conviction is based, in order that court may determine whether alleged newly discovered evidence is merely cumulative or impeaching. Accordingly, injury is done to the defendant in appeal to allow introduction of evidence adduced at trial. Herrin v. State, 71 Ga. App. 384, 31 S.E.2d 124 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that evidence authorized verdict does not preclude different result on new trial.</b> - Fact that verdict was authorized by evidence adduced at trial in no way precludes probability of different verdict on another trial with newly discovered evidence, when evidence merely authorized, but did not demand, verdict, and such verdict was before vital, newly discovered evidence supplying missing link was before jury.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption in favor of verdict sustains judge's discretion in upholding verdict when evidence conflicts.</b> - Under motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, when evidence consists of conflicting oaths, presumption in favor of verdict is sufficient to sustain exercise of discretion by judge in upholding verdict.

<p class="p4">In a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence in a criminal trial, when there is a countershowing by the state, the judge is the trier of facts, and it is the judge's province to determine credibility of facts and contradictory witnesses, and the judge's discretion in refusing a new trial on alleged newly discovered evidence will not be controlled unless manifestly abused.

<p class="p4">When motion for new trial is based on ground of newly discovered evidence, and there is a countershowing, with conflicting evidence as to truth of alleged newly discovered facts, the Supreme Court will not interfere with grant or refusal of new trial on that ground, unless there has been a manifest abuse of discretion which law has vested in the trial judge, but not conferred on the Supreme Court. Southwell v. State, 188 Ga. 310, 4 S.E.2d 26 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>When countershowing rendered it doubtful as to what witness would testify.</b> - In motion for new trial upon ground of newly discovered evidence, when state made countershowing with a later affidavit of witness who proposed to testify in behalf of the defendant, which showed that the proposed witness largely repudiated the witness's first affidavit, rendering it doubtful or equivocal as to what the witness would testify, the judge did not err in overruling motion. Cannon v. State, 194 Ga. 277, 21 S.E.2d 689 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No error in denying defendant's motion for new trial.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial when the state did not stipulate during the sentencing phase of trial that the shotgun found in the defendant's possession was improperly measured. The state simply did not object to the defendant's introduction into evidence of a document giving instructions for measuring the length of the barrel of a rifle or shotgun. Wiley v. State, 204 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Juror's alleged presence while codefendant pleaded guilty.</b> - Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial as the trial court's finding that defendant's jurors were not present when the codefendant pleaded guilty was not clearly erroneous since the victims testified that: (1) the victims were present in the courtroom during the codefendant's guilty plea; (2) the victims were familiar with and would have recognized the jurors selected to hear the defendant's case; and (3) no jurors selected to hear the defendant's case were present in the courtroom during the codefendant's guilty plea.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant's competency no basis to conduct hearing or issue ruling on new trial motion.</b> - Trial court erred by refusing to conduct a hearing or to rule on the defendant's motion for a new trial based upon the court's finding that the defendant was, at that time, mentally incompetent and unable to assist the counsel in challenging the conviction, as defendant's current mental incompetence provided no logical basis to delay a post-conviction proceeding to address whether the defendant was incompetent at trial, whether the trial court should have been on notice of the defendant's incompetency and conducted a hearing during trial, or whether the trial counsel was ineffective for failing to timely raise the competency issue.

<p class="p4"><b>Without a record of trial,</b> the Court of Appeals was forced to be in accord with the presumption in favor of regularity of the trial court's denial of the motion, and assume that the court's findings were supported by sufficient competent evidence; thus, the findings made against the intervenor regarding the legitimation of a child he claimed to be the biological father of were upheld.

Seaney &amp; Co. v. Katz, 132 Ga. App. 456, 208 S.E.2d 333 (1974). But see Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., 230 Ga. 8, 195 S.E.2d 417 (1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of trial judge in declaring mistrial.</b> - Trial judge in passing on motions for mistrial has a broad discretion, dependent on the circumstances of each case, which will not be disturbed unless manifestly abused.

<p class="p4">When a criminal defendant was tried on charges of kidnapping and murder, and after the court had recharged the jury three times on kidnapping, the defendant, for the first time, requested a charge on false imprisonment; the trial court did not err in failing to give the defendant's requested charge on false imprisonment; the request was not made at or before the close of the evidence, and the evidence did not authorize the charge.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on the Statute of Frauds because, while the defendant made an oral, non-specific request, the defendant did not offer a written charge adjusted to the facts of the case; the defendant did not include the defense of the Statute of Frauds in the pretrial order and did not move to modify that order; the defendant did not raise the defense of the Statute of Frauds simply by stating that the defendant intended to rely on all applicable statutes governing contracts and all applicable legal principles and rules of contract law, quasi-contracts, and equitable remedies and relief; and the defendant's promise to the plaintiffs was one of indemnity, which generally fell outside the Statute of Frauds.

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose for requiring that copies of jury instruction requests be given to opposing counsel.</b> - Requirement that copies of jury instruction requests be given to opposing counsel at the time the requests are submitted to court can serve no useful purpose other than to afford opposing counsel an opportunity to argue to the court, before granting or refusing of such request, counsel's contentions with respect to whether such requested charges should be given. Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., 230 Ga. 8, 195 S.E.2d 417 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reason subsection (b) contains no provision relating to objections to refusals of requests to charge.</b> - Unlike subsection (a), subsection (b) contains no provision relating to objections to refusals to grant requests to charge. This is because when party has presented to court written requests that it instruct jury on law as set forth therein, court normally affords such party at that time an opportunity to state grounds upon which he contends such submitted request to charge should be given. The court is thus at that time put on notice as to the grounds upon which it is urged such requests to charge should be given. Continental Cas. Co. v.

<p class="p4"><b>Extent of exemption of criminal defendants as to requests for instructions.</b> - While this section exempts defendant in criminal case from strict requirements imposed on litigants in civil cases to preserve issue on giving of or failure to give instructions to jury, it does not relieve him from necessity of requesting instructions, or making timely objection in trial court on failure to give instructions, except in those circumstances where omission is clearly harmful and erroneous as a matter of law in that it fails to provide jury with proper guidelines for determining guilt or innocence.

<p class="p4">While this section exempts the defendant in a criminal trial from the strict requirements imposed on litigants in civil cases to preserve issue on giving or failure to give instructions, this does not relieve the defendant from the necessity of requesting clarifying instructions or making clear the defendant's objection so that the trial court can exercise an opportunity to correct possible errors at most opportune point in proceedings and thus allow review by the appellate court. Bradham v. State, 148 Ga. App. 89, 250 S.E.2d 801 (1978), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 243 Ga. 638, 256 S.E.2d 331 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to charge on witness identification not error.</b> - Trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury on witness identification with regard to a defendant's trial for armed robbery and other crimes as the defendant never requested the charge and identification was not an issue since there was no eyewitness testimony that specifically identified the defendant as the perpetrator of the armed robbery or of the theft of the pickup truck.

<p class="p4"><b>Charging upon theory entirely dependent on defendant's statement.</b> - Trial court is not required to give to the jury instructions upon any theory which depends for its existence solely upon the defendant's statement, unless there be presented to court before beginning the court's charge an appropriate written request.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for charge if multiple defendants.</b> - While it would have been better had a trial court explicitly told a jury to decide the guilt or innocence of each codefendant separately, the court's instructions were not sufficiently prejudicial to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, especially since the defendant neither failed to request such an instruction nor made any objection to the trial court's charge.

<p class="p4"><b>Charge on element of intent.</b> - Trial court properly instructed the jury that, in order to convict the defendant, a finding of intent was required; then, the trial court differentiated the types of intent involved and read the elements of each crime directly from the statutes for the jury's consideration and thus, as a whole, the jury instructions appropriately enabled the jury to judiciously determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to charge on presumption of innocence.</b> - Trial court's failure to properly charge the jury after closing arguments on the presumption of innocence, burden of proof, and the standard of proof was reversible error. The error was not harmless because the jury was presented with conflicting testimony and the eyewitness was an informant whose identity was not revealed to the defendant. Little v. State, 230 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Instruction on rules of road.</b> - There was no substantial error in the jury charge when even though a certified copy of the driver's guilty plea to driving on the wrong side of the road was entered in evidence, it was not an admission of liability, and the injured person still had to establish the driver's negligence, causation, and damages; thus, there was no injustice in instructing on the rules of road, and when the administrator for the driver's estate failed to object to those charges, the administrator was not entitled to relief under the substantial error rule.

<p class="p4"><b>Negligent hiring, retention, and entrustment instruction.</b> - In an action arising from a collision between an automobile driver and a truck driver, the jury's punitive damages verdict against the employer of the truck driver was improper as the employer could not be vicariously liable when the truck driver had been discharged from personal liability because the automobile driver failed to request instructions to charge on negligent hiring, retention, and entrustment and failed to object on the instructions given under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-24(a).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge on retreat required when defendant claimed self-defense.</b> - Trial court erred in failing to charge a jury on the principles of retreat even thought the request for the instruction was made orally because self-defense was the defendant's sole defense, the prosecution placed the concept of retreat in issue during cross-examination of the defendant, and evidence of the defendant's guilt on charges that included aggravated assault was not overwhelming.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to object to jury instruction regarding damages.</b> - Although the condemnee contended that the trial court erred in failing to inform the jury that the jury could consider the right to cure as a part of consequential damages, the court was correct in explaining to trial counsel that evidence of damage to property as a result of a taking, as represented by a cost to cure, may be considered a factor in establishing the reduced fair market value of the remaining property after the taking although the cost to cure may not be recovered as a separate element of damage; although the trial court instructed the jury that the cost to cure may not be recovered as a separate element of damage, the court did not inform the jury that the cost to cure could be a factor in establishing the reduced fair market value of the remaining property after the taking. But the condemnee did not take advantage of the opportunity provided by the court to have the condemnee's expert clarify cost to cure for the jury, and the condemnee waived any claim of error because the condemnee made no objection following the court's instruction. Moreover, the appellate court found no substantial error in the court's instruction that was harmful as a matter of law in light of the court's charge to the jury at the end of trial concerning consequential damages.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to instruct that counsel's arguments were not evidence.</b> - In a slip and fall case, although the final instructions failed to instruct the jury that argument of counsel did not constitute evidence, the trial court covered this issue in preliminary instructions, and the charge was not so blatantly prejudicial as to deprive the store patron of a fair trial.

<p class="p4"><b>Charge on suicide in medical malpractice action.</b> - In a medical malpractice suit, the complained-of charge did not amount to a substantial error as a matter of law because the defendants failed to object to the charge and, in considering the charge as a whole, the instruction that if suicide was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendants' negligent conduct, legal causal connection between that conduct and the injury was not broken and was not an erroneous charge prejudicial to the defendants.

<p class="p4"><b>Charge as to apportionment.</b> - In a personal injury case, the defendant's apportionment claim was an affirmative defense; thus, the defendant had the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the nonparty tractor-trailer driver was negligent and that the driver's negligence proximately caused all or some portion of damages to the plaintiff; thus, the trial court committed no error in charging the jury to that effect.

<p class="p4"><b>Errors harmful as a matter of law.</b> - Appellate court was entitled to consider whether a substantial error in a jury charge was harmful as a matter of law, regardless of whether or not the defendant objected to the jury charge in the trial court. The trial court's failure to charge the jury on defendant's sole issue of self defense in the defendant's felony obstruction of an officer case involved substantial error that was harmful as a matter of law, even though the defendant did not object, as some evidence supported giving the instruction and the failure to give the instruction was the equivalent of directing a verdict against the defendant.

<p class="p4">When record discloses that no objection was made at trial to any part of the court's charge, there must have been substantial error in the charge which was harmful as a matter of law in order for the appellate court to consider and review the charge. Parks v. State, 230 Ga. 157, 195 S.E.2d 911 (1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When appellant made no objection to trial court's charge, even when asked specifically by court if the appellant had any question or additions to the charge, unless there is substantial error which is harmful as a matter of law, such acquiescence in given instruction is reason enough to find appellant's enumeration of error regarding the charge to be without merit. Johnson v. State, 156 Ga. App. 411, 274 S.E.2d 778 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 989, 101 S. Ct. 2327, 68 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Record should contain reasons for requested charge.</b> - Grounds of objection, i.e. the reasons urged for the requested charge, should be placed somewhere on the record, although all that is needed after the charge is a perfunctory objection identifying the omitted requested charge; and while the record need not be made with any particular formality, enough should appear so that the reviewing court can ascertain the grounds urged below.

<p class="p4"><b>No waiver when trial court incorporated by reference objections.</b> - When appellee made the threshold assertion that plaintiffs waived objection made during the charge conference by not excepting to the charge after the jury was instructed, and when the nature of the objection raised here was not entirely the same as that made at the charge conference, the Court of Appeals addressed the merits, because the trial court stated after the jury charge that the judge incorporated by reference the conference objections and rulings, and after recharge again took blanket note of the previous "exceptions;" by the court's "incorporation" statement, made unsolicited at a time when an invitation to state exceptions should have been extended, the court implied that the court assumed the parties would raise exceptions similar to the objections voiced during the charge conference, and further that the court rejected the exceptions; thus, the court created an awkward situation for which the party was not penalized.

<p class="p4">Because an appellant readily admitted that the appellant failed to request charges on circumstantial evidence and speculative damages and did not object to the charge given by the trial court, the appeals court refused to hold that the trial court's failure to give the charges, sua sponte, created such a gross injustice as to deprive the appellant of a fair trial.

Nichols v. State, 288 Ga. App. 118, 653 S.E.2d 300 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In convictions that included aggravated assault on a peace officer, defendant failed to show substantial error under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-24(c) in the instruction regarding use of a handgun as a deadly weapon because, viewed as a whole, the jury charge did not take from the jury's consideration the issue of whether the handgun was a deadly weapon. Smith v. State, 301 Ga. App. 670, 688 S.E.2d 636 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the defendant did not file a proposed charge on corporations being a separate legal entity and did not ask for one during the charge conference, because the court's charge to the jury on contract formation included the requirements of having parties with the capacity to contract who consent and agree to all terms of the contract, and the defendant argued to the jury that if there was a promise, it came from the real estate development company, not the defendant personally, there was nothing in the court's charge to the jury that would have prevented the jury from agreeing with the defendant and finding no personal liability; thus, there was no substantial error in the jury charge that was harmful as a matter of law. Zambetti v. Cheeley Invs., L.P., 343 Ga. App. 637, 808 S.E.2d 41 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to find waiver based on induced error.</b> - It was error to hold that personal injury plaintiffs waived appellate review of a jury recharge under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-24(c) based on the doctrine of induced error; the "induced error" consisted solely of the plaintiffs' alleged failure to request specific language that would have made the recharge accurate and to object to the absence of an instruction concerning the foreseeability of an intervening act, and thus the acts the court of appeals held to have induced the error were the same acts excused by <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-24(c) when there was substantial error in the charge. Pearson v. Tippmann Pneumatics, Inc., 281 Ga. 740, 642 S.E.2d 691 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error not harmful as a matter of law.</b> - Trial court's failure to give a charge under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-4-6 was not harmful as a matter of law because the state presented direct evidence that the defendant committed the crime of kidnapping. Holden v. State, 287 Ga. App. 472, 651 S.E.2d 552 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0189, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 153 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to give inconsistent charge did not constitute substantial error.</b> - In a wrongful death suit brought by a personal representative, a failure to give a certain instruction did not constitute substantial error; the instruction would have been inconsistent with the procedures adopted by the trial court and acquiesced in by the parties, and the representative had not requested the instruction, so the asserted error was waived. Turner v. New Horizons Cmty. Serv. Bd., 287 Ga. App. 329, 651 S.E.2d 473 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Incorrect charge on fraudulent intent.</b> - An erroneous jury instruction regarding misrepresentation and concealment could be considered on appeal pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-24(c) even though grounds for an objection had not been stated as required by <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-24(a). The charge, which incorrectly stated that fraudulent intent did not have to be proven, concerned legal principles that were central to the defense that a closing attorney had not acted with fraudulent intent. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. New Freedom Mortg. Corp., 288 Ga. App. 350, 654 S.E.2d 190 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 288 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of the word "a" instead of "the" was not substantial error warranting review absent an exception.</b> - Trial court's substitution of the word "a" for "the" in a jury charge regarding the factors to be used in the equitable division of marital property was not so substantial or necessarily harmful as to warrant review under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-24(c) when no exception was taken by the spouse.

<p class="p4"><b>Any ruling comprehended in scope of verdict may be urged</b> in motion for new trial. Carrington v. Brooks, 121 Ga. 250, 48 S.E. 970 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former Penal Code 1910, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 1089 (see O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 5-5-25) is frequently construed with former Penal Code 1910, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 1084 (see O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 5-5-50),</b> providing that the first grant of a new trial will not generally be disturbed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compare to motion in arrest of judgment.</b> - Court of Appeals of Georgia could not consider the defendant's motion for a new trial as a viable procedural substitute for a motion in arrest of judgment. Kirkland v. State, 282 Ga. App. 331, 638 S.E.2d 784 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Ground of motion for new trial must be complete in itself,</b> or rendered so by exhibit to motion. Barber v. State, 136 Ga. 831, 72 S.E. 248 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grounds which cannot be understood without resort to brief of evidence.</b> - Insufficient grounds of motion which are incomplete and cannot be understood without resorting to brief of evidence fail to present any question for decision. Head v. State, 144 Ga. 383, 87 S.E. 273 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient objection.</b> - The objection raised below was not sufficient to direct the trial court's attention to the claimed error and was not stated with sufficient particularity to leave no doubt about the portion of the charge challenged or what the specific ground of challenge was; therefore, the issue was not preserved on appeal. Anderson v. State, 231 Ga. App. 807, 499 S.E.2d 717 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a mistrial because the defendant requested a curative instruction after the motion for a mistrial was denied, and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard a witness's comment, and since defense counsel did not renew the mistrial motion thereafter, the defendant could not complain of the failure to grant the motion. Reese v. State, 289 Ga. 446, 711 S.E.2d 717 (2011), overruled on other grounds State v. Lane, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 98 (Ga. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Approval of verdict necessary to finalize verdict when party moves for new trial on general grounds.</b> - Before a verdict becomes final the verdict should, when the losing party requires by motion for new trial, receive approval of the mind and conscience of trial judge. Until the judge's approval is given, the verdict does not become binding in a case when a motion for new trial contains general grounds. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section is mere declaration of what law was when Code was adopted,</b> and confers no right or power on court other than that already existing. It is an inherent power in superior court to review its own rulings. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Lancaster, 75 Ga. 280 (1885).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion on grounds not otherwise provided for.</b> - Section gives trial court discretion regarding new trials on grounds not specifically provided for by law. Vaughan v. Car Tapes, Inc., 135 Ga. App. 178, 217 S.E.2d 436 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion regarding extraordinary motions for new trial.</b> - In considering all applications for new trial made on extraordinary grounds, the trial judge is vested with sound legal discretion. Johnson v. State, 244 Ga. 295, 260 S.E.2d 23 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion to grant or refuse new trials extends to second verdict.</b> Morgan v. Lamb, 16 Ga. App. 484, 85 S.E. 792 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge who did not preside at trial has less discretion</b> than presiding judge. Throgmorton v. Trammell, 90 Ga. App. 433, 83 S.E.2d 256 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate court is bound to recognize trial court's discretion</b> to grant or refuse new trials. Cargyle v. Belcher, 43 Ga. 207 (1871).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate courts have no discretion regarding new trials.</b> - Law permits trial judge to refuse or grant new trials, in exercise of legal discretion, but it does not give appellate court any discretion in the matter; it can only grant new trials when errors of law have been committed, or when trial judge has abused the judge's discretion in refusing new trial. Prosser v. State, 60 Ga. App. 604, 4 S.E.2d 499 (1939); Holton v. State, 61 Ga. App. 654, 7 S.E.2d 202 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion extends to passing upon alleged prejudice and bias of juror.</b> - Discretion of trial judge in passing upon alleged prejudice and bias of juror from conflicting evidence on motion for new trial will not be interfered with, unless the discretion is manifestly abused. Bradberry v. State, 170 Ga. 859, 154 S.E. 334 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When credibility of witnesses and weight of testimony involved.</b> - When credibility of witnesses and weight to be attached to testimony introduced is addressed solely to discretion of trial court in exercise of sound legal discretion, and where it appears that there was no abuse of discretion in a particular judgment, overruling motion for new trial must be affirmed. Wallace v. Wallace, 229 Ga. 607, 193 S.E.2d 832 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial judge presumed to exercise discretion required of the judge.</b> - When there is nothing in an order overruling a motion for new trial to indicate that the judge was dissatisfied with the verdict on discretionary grounds, but on the contrary, in overruling the motion on all grounds and refusing a new trial on all of them indicated the judge's approval, the appellate court will not say the judge abused the judge's discretion, since the trial judge is presumed to have known the judge's obligation was to exercise legal discretion and that in overruling motion is presumed to have exercised this discretion. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption that trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict.</b> - In interpreting language of order overruling motion for new trial, appellate court must presume that trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict devolving upon the judge, and that in overruling the motion the judge did exercise this discretion, unless language of order indicates to contrary and that court agreed to verdict against the judge's own judgment and against the dictates of the judge's own conscience, merely because the judge did not feel that the judge had the duty or authority to override findings of jury upon disputed issues of fact. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Excluded evidence.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial, as a statement to police the defendant made was freely and voluntarily given upon the issuance of Miranda warnings, and the trial court properly excluded evidence of prior abuse committed against the victims by third parties on relevancy grounds, not under the rape shield statute, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-2-3 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-4-412).

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence properly admitted.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to suppress the results of a blood test, as the notice given to the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>defendant by a state trooper under the implied consent law, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-5-67.1(a), was sufficiently accurate to permit the defendant to make an informed decision about whether to consent to testing, and the evidence failed to show that the defendant requested an independent test.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial when a police officer testified that the defendant admitted the defendant's involvement in another incident after the trial court had granted the defendant's motion in limine to exclude any evidence of the defendant's admitted involvement in another criminal matter because the officer's testimony referred to another incident and not another crime per se, and the defendant did not show that a mistrial was essential to preserve the defendant's right to a fair trial; any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt. Nyane v. State, 306 Ga. App. 591, 703 S.E.2d 53 (2010), cert. denied, No. S11C0420, 2011 Ga. LEXIS 538 (Ga. 2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err when the court denied the defendant's motion for new trial on the basis that the state proffered similar transaction evidence of an incident that occurred when the defendant was a juvenile because the trial court did offer to give a curative instruction to the jury, but trial counsel refused the curative instruction citing "strategy" as counsel's reasons; the trial court admonished the witness not to make any references to the juvenile court proceeding.

<p class="p4"><b>Showing which permits new trial from adverse default judgment.</b> - When motion for new trial sets up facts from which it appears that the defendant's lack of knowledge of proceedings, which resulted in adverse default judgment was through no fault of the defendant's own; that the defendant had no knowledge of the proceedings; that person upon whom service was made had no authority from it to accept service of process; that the defendant had a meritorious defense which would, upon another trial of the case, lead to a contrary result; and that, after being informed of default judgment against it, it immediately used all diligence possible to bring true facts before the court, the motion presents such a state of facts that first grant of new trial by the trial judge does not constitute an abuse of discretion.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When defendant is ill, defendant must notify court and obtain continuance if time permits.</b> - When defendant had ample opportunity to inform the court of the defendant's sickness and obtain a continuance, but failed to do so, a new trial will not be granted on ground of the defendant's absence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant must exercise diligence in employing new counsel before trial.</b> - It is not error to refuse new trial at instance of defendant who could have, in exercise of diligence, been present with counsel, which the defendant had ample opportunity to employ, after withdrawal of counsel already representing the defendant.

<p class="p4"><b>Jury misconduct warranting new trial.</b> - For misconduct of jury to be cause for new trial it must affirmatively appear that neither party complaining nor that party's counsel had any knowledge of such misconduct before the verdict. Schmidt v. Parrish, 63 Ga. App. 663, 11 S.E.2d 921 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for mistrial because a juror's improper behavior was brought to the trial court's attention immediately after the behavior occurred, and upon learning of the improper behavior, the trial court examined the offending juror without delay and subsequently dismissed the juror from the jury; the remaining jurors were then examined and indicated by their response to the trial court's question that the jurors had not overheard any comments on the case by the offending juror, and thus, even though the alleged improper comment involved the ultimate issue in the case, the record reflected no evidence that the jury was tainted or that the defendant was harmed by the juror's misconduct. Brown v. State, 309 Ga. App. 511, 710 S.E.2d 674 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of perjured testimony at preliminary hearing.</b> - When perjured testimony is used at a preliminary hearing but not at trial, and when the appellant does not demonstrate that testimony contributed to the appellant's conviction, there is no abuse of discretion in the judge's refusing to grant the appellant's motion for new trial. Johnson v. State, 244 Ga. 295, 260 S.E.2d 23 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claim of incompetence of counsel.</b> - This catch-all section appears to be an appropriate vehicle for a claim that a new trial should be granted because counsel incompetently failed to timely move for a new trial on newly discovered evidence. House v. Balkcom, 562 F. Supp. 1111 (N.D. Ga. 1983), rev'd on other grounds, 725 F.2d 608 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 870, 105 S. Ct. 218, 83 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court of appeals rejected the defendant's contention on appeal that the trial court prevented the defendant to fully develop an ineffective assistance of counsel claim at the hearing on a motion for a new trial, as the record was replete with evidence that the defendant was given a great deal of latitude and ample opportunity to develop the issue. Brown v. State, 285 Ga. App. 453, 646 S.E.2d 289 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1503, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 672 (Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial after the defendant was convicted of statutory rape because the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel; the trial court's determination that the defendant's trial counsel articulated a reasonable defense strategy was not clearly erroneous because counsel made a strategic decision that a specific line of investigation was unnecessary since the expected finding from the investigation would not have been helpful to the defense employed, and at trial, counsel presented evidence consistent with the defense strategy. Burce v. State, 299 Ga. App. 849, 683 S.E.2d 901 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ineffective counsel established as to one charge but not as to other.</b> - Because the defendant presented sufficient evidence to show that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to stipulate to the defendant's felon status or to obtain a jury charge limiting the jury's consideration of the defendant's criminal history, such failures prejudiced the defendant's defense sufficiently to require a new trial on a charge of aggravated assault; however, given the defendant's admission to possessing a gun at the time of the altercation, no prejudice resulted to warrant reversal and a new trial on the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon conviction. Starling v. State, 285 Ga. App. 474, 646 S.E.2d 695 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Untimely objection.</b> - Because the defendant asserted for the first time in an out-of-time appeal that the trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, but the defendant had failed to assert that claim at the trial court level, nor did the appellate counsel seek a new trial and raise that issue upon the out-of-time appeal request having been granted, the appellate court was barred from reviewing the issue; a claim of ineffective assistance had to be raised at the earliest possible time, which in this instance would have been through a new trial motion. Swan v. State, 276 Ga. App. 827, 625 S.E.2d 97 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice of appeal untimely.</b> - Supreme court was without jurisdiction to review the propriety or substance of the trial court's order denying the property owners' motion for new trial because the owners failed to timely file a notice of appeal in regard to that order, and the builders' post-judgment motions for fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 9-11-68 and 9-15-14 did not toll the time for the owners' to appeal from the order denying the owners' motion for new trial; the trial court entered a final judgment on October 4, 2007, and the owners' filing of a motion for new trial tolled the time for appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(a), but as soon as the trial court issued the court's order disposing of the motion for new trial, the thirty-day time period to file a notice of appeal began to run, and the owners' filed the motion for new trial on March 9, 2009. O'Leary v. Whitehall Constr., 288 Ga. 790, 708 S.E.2d 353 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Direct action in corporate dispute.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying plaintiffs' motion for a new trial or, alternatively, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-25 and 9-11-50, after a jury verdict was rendered in favor of defendant in a shareholder dispute arising from an agreement for purchase of the defendant's shares, as the direct action by the defendant on the counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty/usurpation of corporate opportunity was properly brought under Thomas v. Dickson, 250 Ga. 772, 301 S.E.2d 49 (1983), because there were exceptional circumstances, despite the fact that the corporation did not fit the definition of a statutory close corporation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 14-2-902. Telcom Cost Consulting, Inc. v. Warren, 275 Ga. App. 830, 621 S.E.2d 864 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Valid waiver by defendant.</b> - Because the state presented sufficient extrinsic evidence showing that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived a jury trial, even though this evidence conflicted with the defendant's later testimony at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial. Davis v. State, 287 Ga. App. 783, 653 S.E.2d 107 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Adequacy or Legality of Damages</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury's discretion regarding damages does not limit trial judge's discretion.</b> - Broad discretion of jury as to amount of damages is not a limitation on the discretion of the trial judge to set aside the verdict when the judge thinks it unfair, unjust, contrary to evidence, excessive, or too small; but is a persuasive influence not lightly to be disregarded. Trial judge is not to substitute the judge's opinion for that of the jury, but merely sends the case for opinion of another jury. Hornsby v. Davis, 112 Ga. App. 419, 145 S.E.2d 633 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rules governing jury's right to fix damages and courts' rights regarding new trials exist independently.</b> - Rules of law governing (1) right of jury to originally fix damages; (2) right of appellate court to grant new trial where verdict is alleged to be excessive or inadequate; and (3) right of trial judge to grant new trial when in the judge's discretion the judge thinks verdict unfair, unjust, contrary to evidence, excessive, or too small, exist apart from and independent of each other. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Discretion in determination of legal adequacy of verdict for damages.</b> - Determination of question, as to whether verdict for damages is inadequate in legal sense, lies within sound discretion of trial court. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere difference of opinion between appellate court and jury is insufficient.</b> - New trial should not be granted due to mere difference of opinion between appellate court and jury as to amount of recovery in action of tort for unliquidated damages. Something more must be disclosed to warrant interference when substantial damages have been returned. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New trial regarding damages where unliquidated, tort damages involved.</b> - When action sounds in tort, for recovery of unliquidated damages, to measurement of which no fixed rule of law can be applied, appellate court ought not to set aside verdict of jury simply because damages are, in its opinion, inadequate or excessive, unless it clearly appears that verdict is so grossly inadequate or excessive as to afford evidence of bias, passion, or prejudice, or of mistake and oversight, in failing to take into consideration the proper elements of damage in assessing amount of recovery. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When judge can conscientiously acquiesce in verdict, trial judge should approve verdict.</b> - If trial court can conscientiously acquiesce in amount awarded in verdict, though it may not exactly accord with the court's best judgment or though some other finding might seem somewhat more satisfactory to the judge's mind, and if the judge's sense of justice is reasonably satisfied, the judge should, in absence of some material error of law affecting trial, approve it, and an appellate court will uphold the judge in so doing, and will not say that the judge abused the judge's discretion. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, 71 Ga. App. 437, 31 S.E.2d 236 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Abuse of discretion is prerequisite to interference with denial of new trial.</b> - When the trial judge refuses to order a new trial on the ground of inadequate damages in a tort action, the appellate court will interfere with that discretion only in the case of manifest abuse.

<p class="p6"><b>3. Grounds Warranting New Trial</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Misconduct, mistake, surprise, and prejudice.</b> - Misconduct, mistake, surprise, and prejudice, and other grounds of failure, are provided against by expedience of new trial. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Harden, 113 Ga. 453, 38 S.E. 949 (1901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Absence of party from providential cause unknown to the party's counsel</b> is valid ground for motion for new trial. Hayes v. States, 91 Ga. 43, 16 S.E. 270 (1892).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General grounds did not warrant new trial.</b> - Because there was some evidence supporting the jury's verdict in favor of homeowners in the homeowners' class action against a private water system owner, the trial court did not err in denying the owner's motion for new trial and the owner's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on general grounds, and since the case involved disputed factual issues, the trial court properly allowed the jury to resolve those issues. Although the owner argued that the jury did not interpret the facts as the owner believes the jury should have, that argument presented no grounds that would allow the court of appeals to find error by the trial court in refusing to overturn the jury's verdict. Jones v. Forest Lake Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, 304 Ga. App. 495, 696 S.E.2d 453 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>When accused is forced to trial only with advice of counsel then and there appointed.</b> - When counsel's absence is due to unintentional statement of solicitor (now district attorney) and accused is forced to trial with advice only of attorney then and there appointed by court, new trial will be granted. Johnson v. State, 1 Ga. App. 729, 57 S.E. 1056 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ineffective assistance of counsel.</b> - Defense counsel's introduction of certified copies of convictions of state's witnesses to impeach the witnesses, without redacting the portion that implicated defendant as a participant in those crimes, which were identical or incidental to the crimes for which the defendant was on trial, was deficient performance by counsel as the main evidence against the defendant was the testimony from those witnesses and there was no physical evidence that linked the defendant to the crimes, the fact that the defendant was involved with those same defendants in prior similar crimes could have led the jury to conclude that the same pattern was being repeated, and there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's ineffective assistance, the outcome of the trial would have been different, such that the defendant was entitled to a new trial pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-25. Whitaker v. State, 276 Ga. App. 226, 622 S.E.2d 916 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court committed reversible error when the court did not address a defendant's claim that defense counsel failed to support post-conviction remedies, deliberately foregoing a direct appeal for four years without the defendant's consent, because that ground was closely connected to the defendant's repeated effort to obtain appellate counsel and, as such, a hearing was required; moreover, the defendant was entitled to rely on the fact that a hearing on the motion was scheduled, and as a result, no action was taken to waive or abandon a right to a hearing. Jones v. State, 280 Ga. App. 287, 633 S.E.2d 806 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Upon the state's appeal pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(7), as amended in 2005, the appeals court found that the defendant was properly granted a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel, given counsel's failure to interview any of the state's witnesses, present a viable defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter, and adequately investigate whether the victim's death might have been an accident. State v. McMillon, 283 Ga. App. 671, 642 S.E.2d 343 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because: (1) the defendant raised a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a motion for a new trial based on counsel's failure to locate and present evidence of specific acts of violence by the alleged victim against third persons; (2) trial counsel's statement as to unsuccessfully attempting to locate these witnesses did not negate the possibility that a failure to do so constituted deficient performance; and (3) the defendant raised the ineffective assistance claim at the earliest practicable opportunity, albeit on appeal, the defendant asserted a colorable claim of ineffective assistance that required an evidentiary hearing on remand for the claim's resolution. Portilla v. State, 285 Ga. App. 401, 646 S.E.2d 277 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in granting the defendant a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel as: (1) counsel's pretrial investigation was deficient; (2) counsel made no effort to investigate or to obtain the criminal records of the state's similar transaction witness before trial, and did not ask for more time or a continuance upon learning that the defendant did not have the records; (3) the defendant pointed out that the jury had doubts about the victim's testimony based on their verdict of guilt to sexual battery, as a lesser-included offense of child molestation, the crime the defendant was charged with committing; (4) there was evidence that the victim had reason to lie; (5) the charged incident was not reported until after the defendant's wife hired a divorce lawyer, who then arranged the first interview between the victim and investigators; and (6) given that the evidence against the defendant was not overwhelming, this impeachment evidence was particularly crucial. State v. Lamb, 287 Ga. App. 389, 651 S.E.2d 504 (2007), overruled on other grounds, O'Neal v. State, 285 Ga. 361, 677 S.E.2d 90 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant's absence, due to lack of diligence.</b> - It is no ground for new trial that the defendant, through lack of diligence, failed to be present upon call of case. Diprima v. Hicks, 89 Ga. App. 231, 79 S.E.2d 8 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence properly admitted.</b> - Convictions for driving under the influence of drugs and to the extent that the defendant was a less-safe driver were upheld on appeal as supported by sufficient evidence, given that the defendant drove erratically, manifested signs of impairment, and had three drugs in the defendant's system; hence, when coupled with the fact that no evidence of tampering with the defendant's urine sample was submitted, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in admitting the sample and in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Kelly v. State, 281 Ga. App. 432, 636 S.E.2d 143 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's amended motion for a new trial was properly denied, and an aggravated assault conviction was upheld on appeal, as the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in admitting three photographs depicting the victim's knife wounds; the photographs were not inadmissible merely because the photographs also showed alterations to the victim's body made by medical personnel. McRae v. State, 282 Ga. App. 852, 640 S.E.2d 323 (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 200 (Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because evidence of the defendant's prior drug use, and history of crimes committed against family members fueled by the drug usage, were properly admitted as relevant to the crime's charged, despite incidentally placing the defendant's character in issue, convictions for both aggravated assault and simple assault were upheld on appeal; moreover, even if the trial court erred by admitting this motive evidence, no reversible error resulted which required a new trial. Jones v. State, 283 Ga. App. 812, 642 S.E.2d 887 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied, as the evidence presented against the defendant was legally sufficient, similar transaction evidence was correctly admitted, and the fact that portions of the methamphetamine found, as a result of a search warrant was not tested, was not reversible error. Perry v. State, 283 Ga. App. 520, 642 S.E.2d 141 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a prosecution for armed robbery and robbery by intimidation, the trial court did not err in admitting a copy of the defendant's fingerprint card, pursuant to former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 24-3-14 and 24-5-26 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 24-8-803 and 24-10-1003), despite the defendant's claim that the testifying witness lacked personal knowledge with regard to the circumstances or time of the creation or transmission of the fingerprint card, as the card itself showed that the card was created and transmitted at the time of the defendant's arrest, and was handled in the gathering agency's regular and routine course of business; hence, the defendant was properly denied a new trial. Tubbs v. State, 283 Ga. App. 578, 642 S.E.2d 205 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the state conceded that the trial court's instruction on prior consistent statements was incorrect, a new trial was not required because the statements in question were admitted, not as prior consistent statements, but as admissions by the defendant, and were introduced into evidence by the state as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt.

<p class="p4">As sufficient evidence supported the defendant's convictions, and no reversible error resulted from either the admission of the defendant's two prior convictions for both impeachment and sentencing purposes or based on the jury instructions given or refused, a new trial on these issues was unwarranted. Newsome v. State, 289 Ga. App. 590, 657 S.E.2d 540 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1042, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 494 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in admitting evidence of the defendant's 1993 interference with government property conviction; a new trial was properly denied, because the evidence was properly admitted, not as substantive evidence of the offense at issue, but only as to the issue of credibility, providing support for the evidence's admission. Tate v. State, 289 Ga. App. 479, 657 S.E.2d 531 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C0986, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 386 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contesting sufficiency of indictment.</b> - In a prosecution for burglary, because the variance between the indictment and the proof presented at trial did not misinform or mislead the defendant in any manner that resulted in surprise or impaired a defense, and the defendant could not be subjected to another prosecution for the same offense, the alleged variance was not fatal; as a result, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a directed verdict or for a new trial. Chambers v. State, 284 Ga. App. 400, 643 S.E.2d 871 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the appeals court rejected the defendant's claim that the accusation failed to adequately charge venue, as a charge of DUI incorporated the words "Henry County" in the heading by using the phrase "as prosecuting attorney for the county and state aforesaid" in the body of the accusation, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on that charge; but the court warned the state against such practice, as the solicitor could easily devise forms which stated with clarity the county in which the offense allegedly occurred, and thereby avoid the costs which resulted from having to repeatedly defend the type of challenge the defendant raised. Gordy v. State, 287 Ga. App. 459, 651 S.E.2d 471 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1866, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 128 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the trial court might not have been presented with evidence that the defendant was in physical possession of a firearm during the hijacking of the victim's car, because the evidence that was presented authorized a finding that the defendant was a party to that crime, and that all those involved were joint conspirators, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that the indictment charging possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony was at fatal variance with the proof presented at trial.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effective assistance of counsel.</b> - Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied because the defendant did not establish that the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant was aware of all of the charges against the defendant, the defendant did not inform counsel that there were jurors that the defendant wished to have stricken, it was sound trial strategy to not cross-examine the witness because the witness's testimony would have hurt the defendant, counsel did not request a charge on the voluntariness of the defendant's confession because it contradicted the defense of coercion, the evidence adequately demonstrated that the defendant was intoxicated when the defendant committed the assault and robbery, and the discrepancy in the victim's testimony regarding the car the perpetrator drove was not material since the defendant confessed to the crime. Blocker v. State, 265 Ga. App. 846, 595 S.E.2d 654 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On appeal from two child molestation convictions, the defendant was properly denied a new trial, because the admission of privileged testimony was not erroneous, and trial counsel was not ineffective by: (a) ignoring a consent order barring the state from introducing any written or oral admissions or statements the defendant made before and after a polygraph examination; (b) failing to assert the attorney-client privilege with respect to a polygraph expert's testimony; and (c) failing to adequately prepare a second polygraph expert who testified for the defense at trial; in fact, (1) counsel neither ignored the consent order nor performed deficiently when stipulating to the admission of the polygraph results; and (2) even assuming that counsel was deficient in failing to consult the defendant regarding the attorney-client privilege, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the result would have been different in the absence of the second expert's cumulative testimony. Adesida v. State, 280 Ga. App. 764, 634 S.E.2d 880 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as the appeals court found that the trial counsel's tactical decision not to call the defendant's brother and sister-in-law as witnesses was strategic, and nothing in the record suggested that the defendant was denied a fair trial because trial counsel did not investigate the defendant's competency; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Scott v. State, 281 Ga. App. 106, 635 S.E.2d 582 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In denying the defendant a new trial, the trial court expressly found that trial counsel was not ineffective, specifically finding that: (1) counsel's decision not to provide the defendant with a copy of the discovery was based on the fact that the defendant could not read and was going to rely on someone else at the jail to read the documents, and that counsel was concerned that showing the discovery to another inmate might produce a "snitch;" and (2) prior to trial, counsel spent two and a half hours with the defendant going over the state's evidence. Hence, the trial court concluded that counsel had a good reason for not giving the defendant a copy of the discovery, and that counsel was exceptionally effective in representing the defendant's interests. White v. State, 281 Ga. 20, 635 S.E.2d 720 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that the defendant's trial counsel was ineffective, as the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different if counsel would have: (1) filed a motion for funds to hire an expert on the reliability of cross-racial eyewitness identification and proffer what the testimony of this expert would have been; (2) verified that funds had been withdrawn from the respective ATM machines on the date of the crime or ascertain whether surveillance cameras might have refuted the state's evidence that the defendant was in the carjacked vehicle; and (3) proffered favorable testimony that the defendant alleged could have been provided by the two victims suggesting complicity. Pringle v. State, 281 Ga. App. 230, 635 S.E.2d 843 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As the jury could have found the defendant guilty after listening to the state's witnesses, a psychologist testimony regarding the defendant's competency did not influence the outcome of the trial; hence, defense counsel's failure to object to the psychologist raising the issue about the defendant's mental health was harmless, part of counsel's reasonable trial strategy, and did not amount to the ineffective assistance of counsel entitling the defendant to a new trial. Griffin v. State, 281 Ga. App. 249, 635 S.E.2d 853 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a prosecution for trafficking in cocaine, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of entrapment, as: (1) sufficient evidence was presented that the defendant voluntarily committed the offense upon being given the opportunity to do so; and (2) no evidence was presented to show that the informant employed undue persuasion, incitement or deceit to induce the defendant into selling drugs; thus, the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present evidence to support an entrapment defense was rejected and did not warrant a new trial. Campbell v. State, 281 Ga. App. 503, 636 S.E.2d 687 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a prosecution for armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and obstruction, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on allegations that trial counsel was ineffective, as: (1) a jury charge on the testimony of an accomplice was not required; and (2) in light of trial counsel's cross-examination of the accomplice, the court's credibility charge, as well as the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, a leniency instruction was unnecessary. Hayes v. State, 281 Ga. App. 749, 637 S.E.2d 128 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a prosecution for rape, kidnapping, and sodomy, the defendant did not receive the ineffective assistance of trial counsel merely because counsel failed to impeach the victim's credibility with evidence concerning a 1996 drug arrest, as: (1) the evidence was irrelevant to the circumstances surrounding the defendant's attack on the victim; and (2) the victim never opened the door to an issue of good character; hence, the defendant failed to show that a new trial should have been ordered. Pierce v. State, 281 Ga. App. 821, 637 S.E.2d 467 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Counsel's trial strategy in failing to object to hearsay from a non-testifying codefendant was supported by a decision that the testimony was more beneficial than prejudicial, and that the complained-of testimony was necessary to refute the state's theory that the gun admitted against the defendant could have thrown from the defendant's car; moreover, because the defendant failed to show that but for the admission of that evidence, the outcome of the trial would have been different, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on this ground. Ross v. State, 281 Ga. App. 891, 637 S.E.2d 491 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellate court rejected the defendant's contention that trial counsel was ineffective: (1) in failing to investigate another molestation charge filed against the defendant; (2) by failing to interview the defendant's mother; (3) in not investigating the state's failure to obtain a warrant to determine whether the defendant's computer contained or could access pornographic material; (4) by referring to the defendant's prior criminal record on DUI charges; (5) in introducing several letters from the defendant's daughter into evidence; and (6) by characterizing the defendant in closing argument as guilty of drunken and boorish behavior, as the trial court was authorized to believe counsel's testimony regarding counsel's sufficient preparation for trial, and finding that without a proffer of evidence concerning the defendant's computer, the defendant could not show a reasonable probability that the results of the proceedings would have been different; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective. Carey v. State, 281 Ga. App. 816, 637 S.E.2d 757 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial, which alleged the ineffective assistance of counsel, as mere allegations, without evidence explaining how trial counsel's alleged failures affected the outcome of the trial, could not support the claims and counsel's trial tactics amounted to trial strategy. Slaughter v. State, 282 Ga. App. 276, 638 S.E.2d 417 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because there was nothing in the record to rebut the presumption that trial counsel had legitimate reasons for the strategic decisions made during the trial, specifically relating to concerns regarding a juror's dismissal, the state's examination of the victim's mother, the refreshment of the state's witness's recollection, and closing argument, a motion for a new trial was properly denied on these grounds. Hunter v. State, 282 Ga. App. 355, 638 S.E.2d 804 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant failed to show how trial counsel was ineffective in failing to make objections, failing to file a futile motion to suppress, and failure to object to the admission of evidence, but instead counsel's actions were deemed part of a reasonable trial strategy, the ineffectiveness claim failed and the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on that count. Opio v. State, 283 Ga. App. 894, 642 S.E.2d 906 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of defense counsel for failure to pursue a self-defense or justification defense with regard to the shooting death of the victim since at the hearing on the motion for new trial trial counsel testified that, given the state of the evidence, trial counsel did not consider a self-defense strategy to be viable, and would be at odds with the strategy chosen, namely to seek a conviction for the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter. Trial counsel's decision not to pursue inconsistent defenses was made in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment and was reasonable since the evidence from three eye-witnesses showed that the defendant went to the defendant's car and retrieved a pistol, shot the unarmed victim when the victim was retreating, and then went to where the victim lay and shot the victim several more times. Taylor v. State, 282 Ga. 693, 653 S.E.2d 477 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant failed to present the testimony of either trial counsel to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and thus, the record of the new trial hearing was silent as to what actions were taken by counsel to prepare for the plea or to investigate the ramifications of the previous plea, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's withdrawal of the plea. Jackson v. State, 288 Ga. App. 742, 655 S.E.2d 323 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were without merit, because counsel: (1) adequately explained the decision not to call the defendant's spouse; (2) adequately met with the defendant to discuss the trial strategy and regarding the defendant's decision to waive the right to a jury trial; and (3) had reason to decline objection to the admission of an audio recording of the colloquy between the officers and the defendant at the scene, as that decision supported counsel's trial strategy. Thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on those claims. Defrancisco v. State, 289 Ga. App. 115, 656 S.E.2d 238 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to point out a purported discrepancy in the evidence to the jury, failing to investigate alleged evidence tampering, and failing to object to the inclusion of a charge on mutual combat in the jury instructions, or reserve objections to the instructions, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial. Sanders v. State, 283 Ga. 372, 659 S.E.2d 376 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a continuance to review evidence and have the evidence tested by the defendant's own expert because the defendant presented no evidence at the motion for new trial hearing to support the defendant's bald assertion that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had counsel sought a continuance or independent expert testing. Walker v. State, 288 Ga. 174, 702 S.E.2d 415 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial counsel was ineffective since counsel's motion for continuance did not comply with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-8-25 because the witness in question had not been subpoenaed and, thus, counsel could not comply with the statute; the defendant did not show that the trial court's denial of the motion for continuance was reversible error. Presley v. State, 307 Ga. App. 528, 705 S.E.2d 870 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err by rejecting the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on a motion for mistrial because the defendant failed to demonstrate that the defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel. Although the defendant argued that the defendant's trial counsel failed to ask prospective jurors certain questions during voir dire, the defendant made no assertion as to what answers any prospective juror would have given had he or she been asked any of those questions or as to what significance any such answer would have had. The defendant could not show prejudice with regard to the defendant's assertions that counsel failed to fully investigate the case and call essential witnesses because counsel made no proffer as to what a thorough investigation would have uncovered or what the essential witnesses would have said, and the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that an objection or motion for mistrial related to a detective's testimony would have changed the outcome of the defendant's trial. Ware v. State, 307 Ga. App. 782, 706 S.E.2d 143 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to seek a mistrial after successfully objecting to a witness's testimony that the defendant told the witness that "he would have a shoot-out with police before he ever went back to jail" on the ground that the witness's response placed the defendant's character in evidence because even if counsel's failure to request a mistrial were deemed deficient, no mistrial would have been granted as a nonresponsive answer that impacted negatively on a defendant's character did not improperly place the defendant's character in issue, and another witness had already testified without objection that the witness did not call the police on another occasion because the defendant had told that witness "if the cops came he would come out shooting". Because failure to pursue a futile motion did not constitute ineffective assistance, the defendant failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Billings v. State, 308 Ga. App. 248, 707 S.E.2d 177 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's statement during closing argument amounted to ineffective assistance because the defendant could not demonstrate that the deficiency in trial court's performance prejudiced the defendant; the evidence of the defendant's guilt was overwhelming and there was no reasonable probability that the outcome of the defendant's trial would have been more favorable had trial counsel objected, even successfully, to the prosecutor's statement in argument. Jones v. State, 288 Ga. 431, 704 S.E.2d 776 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because the defendant did not show that: (1) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate the case or meet with the defendant prior to trial; (2) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to interview and cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses as the defendant did not establish a reasonable probability that further interviews and cross-examination would have resulted in a different outcome at trial; (3) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion for immunity from prosecution/plea in bar pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-3-24.2 based upon the defendant's claim of self-defense as it was a matter of trial strategy and the defendant could not demonstrate how the failure to pursue such a claim harmed the defendant; (4) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury charge on the use of force in defense of habitation; and (5) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to test the thoroughness and good faith of the state's investigation. Smith v. State, 309 Ga. App. 241, 709 S.E.2d 823 (2011), cert. denied, No. S11C1266, 2011 Ga. LEXIS 954 (Ga. 2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the trial court properly rejected the defendant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce into evidence two medical evaluation documents, which the defendant alleged would have contradicted statements witnesses gave to the police; it was mere speculation that the witnesses' statements were inconsistent with the medical reports. McClarin v. State, 289 Ga. 180, 710 S.E.2d 120 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1004, 181 L. Ed. 2d 745 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective because the defendant failed to establish that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged deficiencies, the outcome of the trial would have been different; even assuming that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to object to certain testimony, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different, and even if trial counsel had filed a motion to suppress certain evidence and that evidence had been excluded, the remaining evidence adduced at trial was overwhelming. Lowe v. State, 310 Ga. App. 242, 712 S.E.2d 633 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant made no showing that the defendant's wife lacked authority to consent to a search of the marital residence, because the trial attorney's strategic decisions not to pursue a defense or to request a jury poll were not patently unreasonable, and because the defendant's claims were not waived by appellate counsel, the defendant failed to show that the defendant was entitled to a new trial based on counsels' alleged ineffectiveness. Davis v. State, 311 Ga. App. 699, 716 S.E.2d 710 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to trial counsel's failure to renew a motion for mistrial after the trial court gave a curative instruction because the defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice; trial counsel had twice moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied, and the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in giving the curative instruction, which preserved the defendant's right to a fair trial. Sanders v. State, 290 Ga. 445, 721 S.E.2d 834 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel because any error in excluding a witness's testimony regarding the victim's allegedly prior false accusations of sexual abuse was harmless; the defendant could not show that trial counsel was deficient in failing to investigate a matter of which counsel was unaware of at the time. Ellis v. State, 316 Ga. App. 352, 729 S.E.2d 492 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court committed no error in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the defendant could not show that trial counsel was deficient for declining to ask for a contemporaneous limiting instruction; trial counsel did not ask for a contemporaneous limiting instruction on similar transaction evidence since counsel wanted to try to draw the least amount of attention to it as possible, and the trial court gave a limiting instruction on similar transaction evidence in the court's final charge to the jury.

<p class="p4"><b>Not knowing case was set for trial.</b> - Mere fact that counsel and clients had no knowledge that case was on calendar and set for trial is not in itself sufficient to support grant of new trial.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Not knowing when case would be called.</b> - Mere fact that plaintiff's counsel did not know exactly when case would be called, and so was not present to ask for continuance resulting in dismissal, was not ground for new trial, nor was the fact that counsel was trying the case in another court.

<p class="p4"><b>Refusal to allow defendant to dismiss counsel did not warrant new trial.</b> - Because the record showed that the defendant never unequivocally asserted a right to self-representation, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow the defendant to dismiss trial counsel; thus, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial. Pulliam v. State, 287 Ga. App. 717, 653 S.E.2d 65 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 159 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Counsel not ineffective.</b> - Because defense counsel's trial strategy, tactics, and tactical errors did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel and because the defendant did not establish that the deficiency prejudiced the defense, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial was not clearly erroneous. Ford v. State, 272 Ga. App. 798, 613 S.E.2d 234 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant was not erroneously denied a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective, as the evidence, via trial counsel's testimony, showed that: (1) counsel, after gathering the defendant's medical history and interviewing the defendant's medical provider, did not believe the defendant was insane; and (2) counsel, after consulting with the defendant and gaining an approval, made a strategic decision not to pursue a mental health defense, opting instead to pursue a claim of self-defense. Radford v. State, 281 Ga. 303, 637 S.E.2d 712 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit, and did not warrant a new trial, as the defendant failed to show that trial counsel's actions, in which counsel also represented the codefendant who was the passenger in the vehicle the defendant was driving, prejudiced the defense; further, counsel's actions did not slight the defense of one defendant for another, the principles contained in charges on mere presence and equal access were adequate, counsel was prepared for trial, and the prosecutor's closing argument statements were not prejudicial so as to warrant an objection. Garvin v. State, 283 Ga. App. 242, 641 S.E.2d 176 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a murder prosecution, the appeals court rejected the defendant's claims that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue a battered woman syndrome defense and by failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter, as: (1) the evidence showed that the defendant, after consultation with counsel, instead chose to focus exclusively on the defense of justification; (2) the evidence did not support a voluntary manslaughter charge; and (3) the defendant did not want the trial court to charge on voluntary manslaughter. Moreover, at the new trial hearing, because appellate counsel did not ask trial counsel about the decision not to seek the manslaughter instruction, that decision was presumed to be strategic. Ballard v. State, 281 Ga. 232, 637 S.E.2d 401 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as: (1) the defendant failed to give any specific examples of prejudice; (2) the defendant, after consultation with counsel, testified freely and voluntarily; and (3) any objections counsel might have made to a videotaped statement would have lacked merit, as those statements contained evidence of prior difficulties, admissible without notice and without the need for a pretrial hearing; hence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on those grounds. Campbell v. State, 282 Ga. App. 854, 640 S.E.2d 358 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant failed to show that: (1) trial counsel's performance was deficient in failing to call a forensic interviewer as a witness, and that failure prejudiced the defense and would have changed the outcome of the trial; (2) trial counsel's decision not to object to the properly admitted testimony from a forensic interviewer as to the opinion rendered on the victim's intelligence and reactions to certain questions which were consistent with abuse was not ineffective; and (3) the defendant could not show that the failure to call the trial attorney affected the outcome of a motion for a new trial, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims against both trial and appellate counsel lacked merit; thus, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Freeman v. State, 282 Ga. App. 185, 638 S.E.2d 358 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appeals court rejected the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding the admission of a tape-recorded statement and claim that trial counsel should have demanded a Jackson-Denno hearing or a hearing to determine the admissibility of a similar transaction, as: (1) proper res gestae evidence could be admitted without having to follow the rules regarding prior similar transactions; (2) assuming that trial counsel should have demanded a Jackson-Denno hearing, the defendant failed to show how a hearing would have altered the outcome of the trial; and (3) at a hearing on the motion for a new trial, the defendant failed to introduce any evidence whatsoever to suggest that the statement made was involuntary. White v. State, 282 Ga. App. 286, 638 S.E.2d 426 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant failed to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with affirmative evidence showing an infringement of rights or a procedural irregularity in the taking of a prior guilty plea, and the defendant failed to show that an objection by trial counsel to the introduction of the prior plea would have been successful, a claim that trial counsel was ineffective, thus warranting a new trial, lacked merit. Lattimore v. State, 282 Ga. App. 435, 638 S.E.2d 848 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel as the only evidence offered to support this claim was the defendant's own hearsay testimony as to what the desired witnesses were expected to testify to at trial, and such evidence was insufficient; further, the defendant failed to show that counsel's decision to forgo calling such witnesses was unreasonable. Brigman v. State, 282 Ga. App. 481, 639 S.E.2d 359 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective, specifically as to issues of the defendant's competency to stand trial and getting the defendant to agree to a bench trial, as: (1) the record showed that defense counsel adequately pursued the competency issue, filed pre-trial discovery motions, obtained an order for defendant's mental evaluation, hired a forensic psychologist to evaluate the defendant's competency, presented and examined witnesses, cross-examined the state's witnesses, and made a closing argument; (2) even if the court were to assume that trial counsel's failure to interview the various doctors constituted deficient performance, the defendant failed to show any prejudice resulting therefrom; and (3) the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was deficient regarding the decision to pursue a bench trial rather than a jury trial, given that the trial court found that the defendant agreed that the case should be submitted to the court on stipulated facts, rather than to the jury. Wafford v. State, 283 Ga. App. 154, 640 S.E.2d 727 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to specifically challenged testimony presented against the defendant, and a new trial was not warranted based on that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ineffectiveness, as: (1) counsel explained at the hearing on the new trial motion that objections were not made for strategic and tactical reasons, so as to not draw attention to some of the testimony; (2) some of the testimony hurt the credibility of the state's witnesses while enhancing the credibility of the defense theory; (3) counsel attempted to engender sympathy for the defendant; and (4) the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the objections would have been made. Walls v. State, 283 Ga. App. 560, 642 S.E.2d 195 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because trial counsel was adequately prepared for trial, effectively engaged in plea negotiations, made timely objections, properly handled the defense, was not required to make meritless objections, and the defendant ultimately failed to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged errors, the result of the trial would have been different, counsel was found to not be ineffective; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Garrett v. State, 285 Ga. App. 282, 645 S.E.2d 718 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On retrial on one count of child molestation and two counts of aggravated child molestation, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective in admitting notes generated by a forensic evaluator who interviewed the child victim, as the defendant had previously been found guilty in the first trial in which the notes were not introduced. Mewborn v. State, 285 Ga. App. 187, 645 S.E.2d 669 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to obtain a mental evaluation of the defendant prior to trial to determine criminal responsibility, absent record evidence that counsel had advance notice of any mental health problems, and further discussions with the defendant's family would not have revealed a history of significant mental illness; hence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on those grounds. Breland v. State, 285 Ga. App. 251, 648 S.E.2d 389 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a transcript of the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial was not included in the record on appeal, and absent any other proffer of the additional testimony and evidence that the alleged favorable witnesses would have testified to, the defendant could not show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had trial counsel subpoenaed the witnesses; hence, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on that foundation failed.

<p class="p4">Despite the defendant's contrary claims, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to subpoena witnesses necessary to support a defense and failing to adequately raise all issues in the defendant's motion to suppress and motion for independent analysis of the suspected narcotics as: (1) the defendant failed to supply sufficient information about the whereabouts of the witnesses; (2) the defendant failed to produce the witnesses at the motion for a new trial hearing; (3) counsel's strategy in handling the suppression motion showed an appropriate exercise of discretion; and (4) under the theory of defense presented, counsel was not ineffective by failing to obtain an independent examination of the substance tested.

<p class="p4">In a prosecution against the defendant under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-6-4, because the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present an alibi witness, and because the defendant failed to offer evidence that a medical examiner or witnesses from the Department of Family and Child Services would have been favorable to a defense, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit. Herrington v. State, 285 Ga. App. 4, 645 S.E.2d 29, cert. denied, No. S07C1285, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 548 (Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The Court of Appeals of Georgia upheld an order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on counsel's alleged failure to communicate lacked merit, given that no reasonable probability existed, nor did the defendant offer any, that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent counsel's alleged deficient performance. Chambers v. State, 284 Ga. App. 400, 643 S.E.2d 871 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's amended motion for a new trial based on trial counsel's alleged ineffective assistance as the evidence failed to show that counsel's trial strategy was unreasonable, the defendant failed to show prejudice by counsel's actions, and the defendant failed to preserve some of the challenges to counsel's actions for appellate review. Phillips v. State, 284 Ga. App. 224, 644 S.E.2d 153 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On appeal from convictions on one count of aggravated sexual battery and two counts of sexual assault, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial as the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from counsel's failure to call the defendant's wife to testify for the defense, and the appeals court refused to speculate that the wife's testimony would have led to an acquittal. Lee v. State, 286 Ga. App. 368, 650 S.E.2d 320 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because it appeared that trial counsel's strategy was to convince the court that insufficient circumstantial evidence was presented in order to convict the defendant, and counsel's decision not to hire an expert to testify as to how quickly the defendant could become intoxicated was a tactical matter to avoid getting into a battle of the experts, those decisions did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel sufficient to warrant a new trial. O'Connell v. State, 285 Ga. App. 835, 648 S.E.2d 147 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, as counsel was not ineffective in failing to: (1) make meritless objections; (2) raise what was considered a novel legal argument; (3) file futile motions that would not have changed the outcome of trial; (4) require corroboration of the defendant's confession; and (5) anticipate that the defendant's wife might mislead the defense; moreover, the defendant's claim that counsel was inadequately prepared for trial was belied by the record.

Ed. 2d 241 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because trial counsel's strategic decision not to call a close family friend as a witness, who could have rebutted the state's evidence that the defendant was controlling, was supported by testimony that the witness would not have added anything to the defense and might have diluted the defendant's voluntary manslaughter theory, counsel was not ineffective in failing to have the witness testify; thus, the defendant was properly denied a new trial. Johnson v. State, 282 Ga. 96, 646 S.E.2d 216 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as a motion to strike or for a mistrial after the state's expert offered an opinion as to the victim's failure to immediately report the abuse was meritless, and counsel's decision as to how to present the defendant's testimony fell within the realm of reasonable trial strategy, and therefore could not be considered deficient; thus, the claims could not serve as the basis for a new trial. Gaines v. State, 285 Ga. App. 654, 647 S.E.2d 357 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the defendant's amended motion for a new trial as: (1) the defendant failed to support an assertion that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to listen to an audiotape of the defendant's second interview with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation prior to trial; (2) counsel's offhand comment as to hindsight was insufficient to support an inference of deficient performance; and (3) the defendant failed to show that prejudice resulted from counsel's alleged deficiency. Sturgis v. State, 282 Ga. 88, 646 S.E.2d 233 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because trial counsel did not provide the defendant with ineffective assistance to the extent that the relevant strategic decisions made would not have affected the outcome of the trial, and counsel properly chose not to object to the court's failure to merge a kidnapping and false imprisonment conviction, as those were independent offenses, the defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied. Snelson v. State, 286 Ga. App. 203, 648 S.E.2d 647 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied since defense counsel was not ineffective in: (1) failing to investigate the victim's reputation for violence and introduce evidence of that victim's prior violent acts; (2) failing to investigate the defendant's medical records; (3) failing to investigate a state witness's convictions for crimes of moral turpitude and request an impeachment charge concerning that witness; (4) advising defendant not to testify; and (5) failing to present evidence or argument at sentencing.

<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial on appeal from the defendant's convictions of child molestation and aggravated child molestation because: (1) venue was adequately shown by the testimony of a single witness; (2) the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective by failing to prepare for trial, investigate the case, subpoena important documents, interview key witnesses, and object to damaging testimony; and (3) the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for counsel's alleged shortcomings. Brooks v. State, 286 Ga. App. 209, 648 S.E.2d 724 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Rape conviction was upheld on appeal as the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on defense counsel's failure to object to certain testimony from the victim about the defendant's history of selling drugs and failure to subpoena certain medical records, as: (1) testimony from the victim that the defendant gave the victim drugs before some of the sexual encounters between them was admissible as part of the res gestae; and (2) the medical records were generally consistent with the victim's testimony, and therefore no prejudice resulted from failing to subpoena them.

<p class="p4">In a battery prosecution, setting aside the defendant's failure to object to a second attorney's representation at trial, a denial from the defendant's first attorney of an alleged promise to represent the defendant after that counsel's suspension had expired gave the trial court sufficient grounds for finding that no such promise occurred, eliminating the defendant's denial of the right to counsel claim; moreover, inasmuch as the defendant failed to challenge the trial court's finding that the second attorney's representation was effective, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Northington v. State, 287 Ga. App. 96, 650 S.E.2d 760 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object when a medical examiner testified that the victim's death was a homicide and not an accident, and despite the defendant's contrary claim, the testimony was not an expression of the witness' opinion on the ultimate issue in the case, as: (1) counsel did not consider the testimony objectionable because there was no dispute that the "manner" of the victim's death was a homicide, and such tactic was not unreasonable; (2) the ultimate issue for the jury to determine was whether the defendant acted with malice, in response to the victim's provocation, or whether self-defense was an issue; (3) counsel testified that an objection would have been in order had the medical examiner invaded the province of the jury by expressing the opinion that the homicide was a murder; and (4) the defendant failed to show any prejudice by the testimony presented. Berry v. State, 282 Ga. 376, 651 S.E.2d 1 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel based on said counsel's failure to call certain witnesses, as the testimony that these witnesses would have provided would not have affected the outcome of the trial, and counsel was not ineffective to the extent that the defendant was denied the right to testify at trial, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial. Finch v. State, 287 Ga. App. 319, 651 S.E.2d 478 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Bradford v. State, 287 Ga. App. 50, 651 S.E.2d 356 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant did not claim below that trial counsel was ineffective for opening the door to impeachment, the defendant failed to timely raise this argument, and thus the claim was waived for purposes of appeal; as a result, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds.

<p class="p4">Because counsels' advice against putting the defendant on the stand was tactical, counsel made the strategic decision not to strike a challenged juror, and the record reflected the basis for counsels' objection and motion for a mistrial during the state's closing argument, the defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result. Warner v. State, 287 Ga. App. 892, 652 S.E.2d 898 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Because the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in presenting a defense and requesting jury instructions on the defendant's claim of innocence, and was authorized to forego objection to a challenged portion of the state's closing argument, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit and did not warrant a new trial.

Noe v. State, 287 Ga. App. 728, 652 S.E.2d 620 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because any deficiency in counsel's failure to object to an investigator's testimony regarding the hearsay statements of an informant did not prejudice the defendant's defense, the jury was likely to deduce that the defendant was on parole from the fact that a parole officer initiated a search, and pretermitting whether the defendant's response to the investigator's request to search constituted "pre-arrest silence," no deficiency existed in counsel's reasonable strategic decision that the evidence was consistent with the defense, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit.

<p class="p4">Because the evidence showed that: (1) the defendant's trial counsel spent sufficient time investigating and preparing the case; (2) the defendant failed to present evidence of the victim's alleged "false reporting" conviction at the hearing on the motion for new trial or show how counsel's cross-examination of the victim on the false reporting would have affected the outcome of the trial; and (3) trial counsel contacted each and every person the defendant identified as a witness, the defendant's motion for a new trial on grounds that counsel was ineffective was properly denied.

<p class="p4">On appeal from convictions on two counts of child molestation and one count of aggravated sexual battery, the trial court properly found that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on allegations of the ineffective assistance of defense counsel because: (1) the manner in which counsel handled alleged exculpatory evidence pertaining to a similar transaction witness and the cross-examination of that witness, was part of counsel's reasonable trial strategy; (2) the defendant's reciprocal discovery or due process rights were not violated; and (3) the existence of the information sought was known to the defendant, which could have been obtained with due diligence.

<p class="p4">Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not warrant a new trial in a prosecution for rape, kidnapping, aggravated stalking, and two counts of stalking; because of the limited nature of a challenged witnesses' trial testimony, defense counsel made a strategic decision not to seek recusal of the trial judge, who was the brother of the challenged witness, and counsel discussed with the defendant the reasons for not seeking recusal. Pirkle v. State, 289 Ga. App. 450, 657 S.E.2d 560 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">New trial based on counsel's alleged ineffectiveness was unwarranted because the defendant made no affirmative showing that the purported deficiencies in trial counsel's representation in investigating a claim of possible jury tampering amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and were not examples of a conscious and deliberate trial strategy. Dowels v. State, 289 Ga. App. 369, 657 S.E.2d 279 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because: (1) the defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing that the state possessed favorable information, or that the trial's outcome might have been different if videotapes from the cameras on the vehicles of the two responding officers had been produced; and (2) counsel was not required to make an objection to the admission of similar transaction evidence when such would have been futile, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result. Hinton v. State, 290 Ga. App. 479, 659 S.E.2d 841 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant failed to present any evidence of prejudice from trial counsels' alleged deficiency in failing to explore the possibility that the defendant's mental illness might have provided a viable trial defense, and that one counsel failed to adequately prepare the defendant for taking the witness stand, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on the ineffective assistance of counsel.

<p class="p4">New trial based on counsel's alleged ineffectiveness was properly denied because the defendant's numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit; the defendant failed to show that: (1) the number of different instructions sought; (2) any additional investigation or preparation; (3) an objection to evidence of the prior difficulties between the defendant and the victim, and request for a contemporaneous limiting instruction; and (4) a request for an instruction on a defense not alleged, would have changed the outcome of the trial, and the tactical decision as to which defense to pursue was part of a reasonable trial strategy.

<p class="p4">In prosecution against defendant on two counts of child molestation, because trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request a specific jury charge addressing alleged improper bolstering testimony, present any expert testimony which was not helpful to defense, and elicit available favorable evidence and impeach the victim's testimony, defendant's convictions of related offenses were upheld on appeal; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain an electronic enhancement of a videotape depicting a drug sale, which allegedly would have shown that the defendant was not the perpetrator of the offense, because the defendant failed to show that the defendant was prejudiced as a result of trial counsel's failure to obtain an electronic enhancement of the videotape prior to trial since the enhanced images failed to create a reasonable probability that the defendant was not the perpetrator depicted in the images. Moreover, an undercover officer unequivocally identified the defendant as the perpetrator based upon the officer's personal observations and independent memory of the defendant at the time of the drug sale, and although the defendant attempted to prove that another individual was the perpetrator depicted in the videotape's images, the defendant failed to proffer sufficient evidence in support of the defendant's claim.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel's decision not to object to a police officer's passing reference to the defendant's post-arrest silence was a valid exercise of reasonable professional judgment, the defendant failed to rebut the presumption that counsel performed within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance in failing to challenge hearsay testimony, counsel's defense strategy of implicating the codefendants was not unreasonable, and counsel did not fail to present evidence as promised in the counsel's opening statement.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to statements the prosecutor made during closing argument because counsel did object, and defense counsel's objection was successful; while the defendant asserted that counsel should have further moved for a mistrial, such decisions generally fell within the ambit of strategy and tactics. Wilson v. State, 306 Ga. App. 827, 703 S.E.2d 400 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to a question directed to an accomplice because counsel personally opened the line of questioning on cross-examination, and in the absence of counsel's testimony, it was presumed to be a strategic decision; having made that decision, trial counsel could not object, and because trial counsel succeeded in obtaining acquittal on the three most serious charges against the defendant that strongly supported the conclusion that the assistance actually rendered by trial counsel fell within that broad range of reasonably effective assistance that members of the bar in good standing were presumed to render. Wilson v. State, 306 Ga. App. 827, 703 S.E.2d 400 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the codefendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to testimony from one of the victims and a police officer regarding the codefendant's prior purchase of marijuana from one of the victims because drug use showed the codefendant's motive to rob a home where the codefendant believed illegal drugs and money would be found; an accomplice testified that the motive for the robbery was that the victims kept drugs and cash in the apartment and that the codefendant planned the robbery and knew that drugs and money were kept in the house. Wilson v. State, 306 Ga. App. 827, 703 S.E.2d 400 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial when a state's witness interjected bad character evidence because the witness's improper remarks were fleeting, unsolicited, and nonresponsive to the prosecutor's examination questions, and since the defendant did not show that the defendant was otherwise entitled to a mistrial based upon the circumstances, trial counsel's failure to pursue a meritless motion does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel; the trial court sustained the objections to the improper testimony and instructed the prosecutor and witness to restrict the examination and responses, the witness and prosecutor complied with the trial court's instructions, and there was no further mention of the bad character evidence. Boatright v. State, 308 Ga. App. 266, 707 S.E.2d 158 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel's decision not to request the production of the duct tape that was used to bind the defendant when the defendant was allegedly kidnapped was not patently unreasonable because the duct tape itself was cumulative of evidence that was introduced through the defendant's recorded police interview and trial counsel's cross-examination of a detective; even if it was assumed that trial counsel performed deficiently, the defendant proffered no evidence at the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial that an analysis of the duct tape would have bolstered the defendant's alibi defense. Buis v. State, 309 Ga. App. 644, 710 S.E.2d 850 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because trial counsel's failure to object to a detective's testimony did not amount to deficient performance since the testimony was not a statement of the victim's credibility or an invasion of the province of the jury; the testimony concerned the detective's reason for ending the interview with the victim and referring the victim to the Georgia Center of Child Advocacy, and even if the testimony that "a molestation incident occurred" did constitute improper bolstering, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the testimony so prejudiced the defense as to affect the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, the motion was also properly denied because trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's comments during closing argument did not constitute deficient performance; the comments of which defendant complained were permissible since the comments were the conclusion the prosecutor wished the jury to draw from the evidence and not a statement of the prosecutor's personal belief as to the veracity of a witness. Strickland v. State, 311 Ga. App. 400, 715 S.E.2d 798 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no evidence to support an instruction on defense of habitation pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-3-23 and, thus, trial counsel did not perform deficiently in failing to request such an instruction; there was no evidence that the victim was attempting to unlawfully enter or attack the defendant's vehicle at the time the defendant stabbed the victim, and under the facts, there could be no reasonable belief that stabbing the victim was necessary to prevent or terminate the other's unlawful entry into or attack upon a motor vehicle.

<p class="p4">Because the armed robbery count of the indictment sufficiently alleged the elements of armed robbery, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge armed robbery, and the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial as to the ineffective assistance claim; that the property was taken from the person or immediate presence of another is necessarily inferred from the allegation of a use of an offensive weapon to accomplish the taking, and the alleged offense of "armed robbery" can be accomplished only via a taking from the person or immediate presence of another. Patterson v. State, 312 Ga. App. 793, 720 S.E.2d 278 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0574, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 327 (Ga. 2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err when the court denied the portion of the codefendant's motion for new trial alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel because the alleged deficiencies in trial counsel's performance were either without factual basis or were decisions made as matters of trial strategy. Smith v. State, 290 Ga. 428, 721 S.E.2d 892 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the state's argument that no person in the circuit had ever been convicted and later proven innocent because the trial court would not have abused the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial had one been made and did not err when the court credited trial counsel's decision not to object to the prosecutor's closing argument as strategic; even assuming that the prosecutor should not have compared the defendant to others, the subject of wrongful convictions in other cases was brought up by the defendant, and the jury was not impressed either way by the colloquy.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Counsel not ineffective for alleged intoxication.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because the defendant failed to show that the defendant's trial counsel was actually intoxicated on the second morning of the trial and that the defendant's counsel's performance after consuming alcohol affected the outcome of the defendant's trial; nothing in the record showed that the trial court erred in finding that there were no deficiencies in counsel's performance on the second morning of the trial.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When ineffective counsel did not result in prejudice.</b> - Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not warrant a new trial because sufficient evidence of the defendant's intoxication was presented in the record, and the defendant failed to show prejudice resulting from trial counsel's failure to object to defendant's admission to having a prior DUI conviction, even though it was error for trial counsel not to object. Thomas v. State, 288 Ga. App. 827, 655 S.E.2d 701 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">New trial was unwarranted because: (1) the decision not to present the defendant's love interest as an alibi witness was clearly strategic, and thus, could not serve as the basis for an ineffectiveness claim; and (2) counsel's alleged failure to specifically object to the victim's testimony on bolstering and not on leading and speculation grounds impermissibly expanded the enumerated error.

<p class="p4">While the defendant's trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to that portion of the state's closing argument in which the prosecutor referenced a slain officer's funeral a week prior, as that fact had no relevance to the charges the defendant was facing, based on the overwhelming evidence of guilt, including the defendant's admission, the defendant's convictions for trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute were upheld on appeal; thus, a new trial was properly denied.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to disclose unknown reward.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying a motion for a new trial when the state did not disclose a potential reward for one of the state's witnesses when the state's attorney did not know at the time of trial that any witness testifying for the state was subject to a reward. McBee v. State, 210 Ga. App. 182, 435 S.E.2d 469 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>State found not to have committed discovery violation.</b> - Absent any evidence of bad faith on the part of the state, or an order requiring production, the state did not fail to fully disclose all the information regarding the defendant's breath test results. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant either a mistrial or a new trial as a result. Rosandich v. State, 289 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to establish Brady violation.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that the state withheld crucial impeachment evidence regarding an informant because the defendant failed to carry the burden of establishing a Brady claim; the defendant's trial counsel extensively questioned an agent about the informant's criminal history, and during the cross-examination of the agent, trial counsel elicited the fact that the informant had once been addicted to cocaine and again went through the informant's convictions, introducing copies of the convictions for the jury's consideration.

<p class="p4"><b>Absence of key portions of trial record supported verdict.</b> - Because the appellant failed to supply the appellate court with the entire trial transcript in the record on appeal, but only included the pretrial motions and the opening statements at trial, without a complete transcript the court of appeals had to presume that the evidence supported the jury's verdict; thus, a new trial was not warranted. Parekh v. Wimpy, 288 Ga. App. 125, 653 S.E.2d 352 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0520, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 319 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Deputy sheriff's communications with jury.</b> - Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied, as the challenged communications between a deputy sheriff and the jury members were not improper, the deputy properly instructed the jurors to direct their questions to the judge, and the deputy's communications to the jury did not prejudice the defendant.

<p class="p4"><b>Erroneous disallowance of challenge of juror for cause.</b> - When it did not affirmatively appear from the record that the defendant in trial of misdemeanor case had exhausted the defendant's peremptory challenges at the time the panel of 12 jurors was accepted and sworn, the appellate court presumed that the defendant was not prejudiced by action of court in erroneously disallowing the defendant's challenge of certain jurors for cause, and did not grant reversal for alleged error.

<p class="p4">Pretermitting whether a challenged juror would have been disqualified based on a relationship with the defendant, because the testimony from that juror at the new trial hearing did not reveal any bias for or against the defendant, or establish that the relationship affected the verdict, the defendant was not denied a fair and impartial trial. Moreover, even if the juror deliberately answered falsely, the defendant failed to show that a new trial was warranted because that juror had an evil motive or acted otherwise as one of the twelve jurors than with the required impartiality.

<p class="p4"><b>Polling of jurors reveal consensus.</b> - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial and entered final judgments of conviction on the jury's verdict finding the defendant guilty of multiple child molestations even though the defendant alleged multiple grounds for overturning the verdict, as the polling of the last juror was sufficient to establish that the verdict against the defendant was unanimous since the juror said the guilty verdict against the defendant was "her verdict now." That response showed, along with other jurors similar responses, that the verdict was unanimous and it thus did not matter that the juror answered in response to a question before that the verdict had not been that juror's verdict.

<p class="p4"><b>Prejudicial statements made during voir dire.</b> - Trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial when prejudicial statements were made during voir dire because although a prospective juror stated that the juror was not sure if the defendant was the same person accused of raping his grandmother in a prior case, the state elicited more information from the juror, hereby providing the other prospective jurors with the name of another alleged rape victim in a crime for which the defendant was not on trial; the trial court did not undertake any measures to ascertain what, if any, impact the remark had on the panel's ability to decide the case, and the evidence was inherently prejudicial and deprived the defendant of the right to begin the trial with a jury free from even a suspicion of prejudgment or fixed opinion.

<p class="p4">Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to obtain copies of defendant's cell phone records, and the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on this ground.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial because an officer's hearsay statement that the defendant was a narcotics distributor was in response to a question, and there was nothing in the record to suggest that the statement was intentionally elicited by the state; other properly admitted evidence of similar transactions showed that the defendant had two prior convictions for selling crack cocaine to the same undercover agent involved in the case, essentially rendering the hearsay statement cumulative.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's broad discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial because the trial court carefully considered the motion, offered to give a curative instruction, which the defendant declined, and determined that the testimony of the defendant's girlfriend was not harmful enough to warrant a mistrial.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial, which was based upon the defendant's claim that the prosecutor's admonishment of the sole defense witness deprived the defendant of due process because the defendant did not show that the prosecutor's conduct dissuaded a defense witness from testifying or that the prosecutor induced materially less favorable testimony; the witness testified and did so in the defendant's favor, when the witness took the stand the witness did not invoke the Fifth Amendment and did not otherwise refuse to answer any question posed to the witness, and the defendant's lawyer made no attempt to show that the defense witness had made the purported prior inconsistent statement, that the cocaine at issue, in fact, had belonged to the witness, acknowledging at the new trial hearing that counsel simply had made a strategic decision not to ask the witness that question.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by refusing to declare a mistrial because the prosecutor's remarks during closing argument did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial since the prosecutor's remarks did not insinuate that the defendant had attempted to kill any of the officers involved in the case, but instead, the remarks related, in part, to the defendant's obviously precarious situation given the investigator's response to the investigator's encounter with the defendant, namely, drawing the investigator's gun; after being cautioned by the trial court that the wide latitude afforded counsel during closing argument was not boundless, the prosecutor did not revisit the point concerning police officers but turned to the more narrow encounter between the defendant and the victim, which gave rise to the aggravated assault count. Davis v. State, 308 Ga. App. 7, 706 S.E.2d 710 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial on the ground that certain testimony was beyond the scope of the state's pre-trial notice because the evidence was essentially cumulative of the witness's testimony that the defendant pointed a pistol at the witness, and it was highly probable that the testimony did not contribute to the verdicts given the weight of the evidence implicating the defendant; it was not clear from the witness's testimony whether the defendant's display of the defendant's pistol and the defendant's query whether the witness was "still brave" was so closely tied to the defendant's act of pointing the defendant's pistol at the witness that the notice provided sufficient particulars of the incident such that the defendant's defense could not have been harmed by the failure to provide more specific information.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err when the court denied the defendant's motion for mistrial or for new trial following the testimony of an eyewitness to the shooting because a curative instruction preserved the defendant's right to a fair trial and, along with the witness's subsequent admission that the witness had never seen the defendant dealing drugs, was sufficient to counter any alleged harm caused by the witness's comment.

Meeker v. State, 282 Ga. App. 77, 637 S.E.2d 806 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial because: (1) a mistrial based on an allegation of juror misconduct was unwarranted, given the lack of evidence that a dismissed juror impermissibly influenced other jurors by discussing a conversation that the dismissed juror had with the victim; and (2) the trial court dismissed the juror within minutes after the alleged inappropriate contact. Lawrence v. State, 289 Ga. App. 163, 657 S.E.2d 250 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by refusing to declare a mistrial on the ground that an alternate juror made improper comments about the defendant's guilt because the record disclosed no basis upon which to conclude that the misconduct was so prejudicial as to deny the defendant due process; the trial court thoroughly questioned each individual juror under oath about what he or she had heard and whether he or she had the ability to remain fair and impartial and found that each juror could remain impartial. Gresham v. State, 303 Ga. App. 682, 695 S.E.2d 73 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurors as convicted felons.</b> - Although the state notified the defendant and the trial court soon after trial that two jurors were convicted felons, because there was no evidence establishing the identity of either juror, documenting the convictions, or showing that either had not had their rights restored, the defendant's due process rights were not violated; thus, denial of a motion for new trial on this ground was proper. Jones v. State, 289 Ga. App. 767, 658 S.E.2d 386 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conversation between victim and juror.</b> - There was no need for a new trial when the victim, while sitting down outside the courtroom awaiting the start of the day's proceedings, was joined by a juror who sat down next to the victim and made a casual remark concerning the weather; the victim made a noncommittal response and the juror upon recognizing the victim as a witness, left the side of the witness and engaged in no further conversation. Kennedy v. State, 179 Ga. App. 587, 347 S.E.2d 604 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Juror investigated accident scene.</b> - Trial court could not grant a new trial to plaintiff after a jury held for defendant, based on a juror's testimony that the jury foreperson personally investigated the scene of the accident; the testimony impeached the verdict which the jury had returned and the trial court had no power to receive, hear, or consider such evidence. Newson v. Foster, 261 Ga. App. 16, 581 S.E.2d 666 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of waiver of objections.</b> - Because a father waived any objections concerning the form of the verdict, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion when the court denied a motion for new trial on claims for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets asserted against the father's son. Lou Robustelli Mktg. Servs. v. Robustelli, 286 Ga. App. 816, 650 S.E.2d 326 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ineffective assistance of counsel not found.</b> - Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial as defense counsel did not give ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request a Jackson-Denno hearing as there was no basis to object to the introduction of defendant's statement to an investigator as: (1) the defendant was not under arrest at the time of the statement, nor would a reasonable person have understood that the person was under arrest; (2) there was no evidence that the officer sent to insure that the defendant did not leave the hospital before the investigator arrived had any contact with the defendant; (3) that the defendant was in pain or taking pain medication did not render defendant's statement involuntary; and (4) the defendant failed to show that the defendant was prejudiced by the failure to request the hearing. Alwin v. State, 267 Ga. App. 236, 599 S.E.2d 216 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel was not clearly erroneous as defense counsel was not ineffective in failing to preserve an objection to a slip of the tongue in the jury charge that did not mislead the jury and as the decision not to request a jury charge on alibi and mere association was a matter of trial strategy. Brantley v. State, 271 Ga. App. 733, 611 S.E.2d 71 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial as defense counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to preserve an objection to the denial of a motion for a mistrial; the motion was based on a deadlocked jury and it was not error to fail to preserve a claim that the jury deliberated without one member present; further, the defendant failed to show that the jury deliberated with only 11 members present, so the motion would not have been successful. Brantley v. State, 271 Ga. App. 733, 611 S.E.2d 71 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because counsel was not ineffective; counsel was well-prepared, filed pretrial motions, thoroughly cross-examined witnesses, preserved counsel's objections, and successfully excluded hearsay testimony and physical evidence, it was counsel's practice to advise clients of the meaning of trial as a recidivist, of the possible sentences, and of the risks of going to trial, and counsel obtained an acquittal on the greater charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Allen v. State, 272 Ga. App. 23, 611 S.E.2d 697 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claim of improper juror contact.</b> - Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial because: (1) a juror alleged that an unknown person entered the jury room during deliberations and answered a question regarding an issue about which the jury was confused; (2) the juror recalled that the person was male, but could not recall any other details, including whether or not the person was a representative of the prosecutor's office or the exact nature of the question that was supposedly answered; (3) eight other members of the jury panel and the alternate contradicted the testimony; and (4) one of the jurors not present at the new trial hearing submitted a sworn affidavit stating that the juror did not recall any person entering the jury room during deliberations. Cook v. State, 276 Ga. App. 803, 625 S.E.2d 83 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense strategy not to allow defendant to testify.</b> - Defendant failed to show that counsel was deficient and that any alleged deficiency prejudiced the defense because counsel's decision not to call the defendant as a witness at a trial for malice murder was based on sound trial strategy in that counsel balanced the damage to the defendant's justification defense with the risk that defendant's criminal record would have been introduced if the defendant took the stand. Nixon v. State, 279 Ga. 164, 611 S.E.2d 9 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>To facilitate becoming naturalized citizen.</b> - It was not an abuse of discretion to deny the defendant's motion for a new trial, requested to facilitate the defendant's efforts to become a naturalized citizen because the trial court considered that the defendant's sentence for giving a false name to an officer had long since been served, that six years had passed since sentencing, and that the sentence was within the statutory guidelines for misdemeanors; claims the defendant's guilty plea was not voluntary were of no avail as the defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or to appeal, and the times for doing so had expired. Elias v. State, 272 Ga. App. 506, 613 S.E.2d 157 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No error in finding foreign speaking defendants understood proceedings.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendants' motions for new trial on the ground that the defendants could not understand the proceedings. Defendants' claim lacked credibility because at no point during the pre-trial motions hearing or trial did the defendants object or in any way indicate that the defendants could not understand the Spanish translation of the proceedings; during the sentencing hearing, all three defendants responded affirmatively when the trial court specifically asked each of the defendants, through the Spanish interpreter, if the defendants had understood their interpreters and everything the interpreters had explained to the defendants about the trial. Cruz v. State, 305 Ga. App. 805, 700 S.E.2d 631 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inadequate translation of proceedings by interpreter.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting the defendant's motion for new trial based on the ground that the defendant's court-appointed interpreter inadequately translated the proceedings to the defendant because the trial judge made a factual finding that the defendant did not understand what was transpiring during the trial and that the lack of understanding prejudiced the defendant at trial. State v. Tunkara, 298 Ga. 488, 782 S.E.2d 278 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Batson claim unsupported.</b> - Because the record did not support the defendant's Batson claim, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Quillian v. State, 279 Ga. 698, 620 S.E.2d 376 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because: (1) the record did not demonstrate that the defendant's sanity or competency was or should have been a significant issue at trial; and (2) the defendant failed to support an assertion that competency should have been raised, the defendant failed to prove the prejudice prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim due to counsel's failure to request an independent psychiatric examination. Thus, a new trial on this ground was unwarranted. Jennings v. State, 282 Ga. 679, 653 S.E.2d 17 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Services with no value to the client.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying a former employee benefits plan administrator's motion for new trial on the ground that the jury verdict on the administrator's counterclaims were inconsistent because the verdict could be reasonably interpreted to mean that although the administrator did perform work on a client's behalf, the work had no value to the client; the client presented evidence that the administrator's software platform was of no value to the client, and there was evidence that the client had to expend funds to correct errors made by the administrator. Hewitt Assocs., LLC v. Rollins, Inc., 308 Ga. App. 848, 708 S.E.2d 697 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Divorce action.</b> - In a divorce action, the trial court did not err in denying a wife's motion for a new trial as: (1) the court did not err in splitting the federal income tax dependency exemption; and (2) no error resulted from establishing the schedule of physical custody between the parents, the distribution of the parties' marital property, and excepting the custody provisions from supersedeas. Frazier v. Frazier, 280 Ga. 687, 631 S.E.2d 666 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court was not required to grant a new trial based on evidence that the husband and the wife lived together and engaged in sexual relations after the petition for divorce was filed and before the final judgment was entered. McCoy v. McCoy, 281 Ga. 604, 642 S.E.2d 18 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parent surrendering parental rights not entitled to new trial.</b> - Because a parent validly executed a written surrender of parental rights, that parent lacked any right to notice of the proceedings regarding the custody the three children involved and was no longer a "party" to those proceedings; as a result, the parent's extraordinary motion for a new trial seeking to set the custody orders entered after the surrender was accepted was properly denied. In the Interest of A.C., 283 Ga. App. 743, 642 S.E.2d 418 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No violation of bribery statute warranting new trial.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because there was no violation of the bribery statute, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-10-2(a)(1), when the record contained no evidence that the state made payments or promised benefits in exchange for testimony at the defendant's trial with the purpose of influencing informants in the performance of such testimony, and it was up to the jury to weigh the evidence of the state's arrangements with the informants in assessing their credibility; the informants were offered leniency, and one of the informants was paid cash, in exchange for their assistance in drug investigations by the police, only a portion of which involved the controlled buys with the defendant, and although the parties could have contemplated that the informants would testify upon the completion of the investigation, there was no evidence that the informants were paid in exchange for their testimony. Moreland v. State, 304 Ga. App. 468, 696 S.E.2d 448 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Because the trial court's grant of a new trial stemmed from trial error, the defendant could not be retried</b> on an offense of per se DUI, given that the defendant was adjudged not guilty of that charge based upon the insufficiency of the evidence; thus, the trial court erred in denying the plea in bar. Shah v. State, 288 Ga. App. 788, 655 S.E.2d 347 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No inconsistent verdict in criminal case.</b> - Defendant's argument that the jury rendered an unlawful inconsistent verdict presented no basis for reversal of the defendant's convictions for armed robbery, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-8-41, hijacking a motor vehicle, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-5-44.1(b), and aggravated assault, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-5-21, because the appellate record did not make clear the jury's reasoning; the jury was authorized to find the defendant guilty even if the jury found that the defendant used a replica or device having the appearance of a weapon to commit armed robbery. Smith v. State, 304 Ga. App. 708, 699 S.E.2d 742 (2010), overruled on other grounds, Reed v. State, 291 Ga. 10, 727 S.E.2d 112 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting the defendant a new trial as defense counsel's decision to present evidence of the defendant's two prior convictions for intent to distribute cocaine was in furtherance of defense counsel's reasonable trial strategy to portray the defendant as a drug dealer and to support the defense's theory that the defendant's fingerprint was found on the stolen car because the defendant sold drugs to someone driving the same car, not because the defendant was involved in the armed robbery of the two victims.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney fees awarded were reasonable.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying a law firm's motion for new trial after the court awarded the firm fees under a contingency fee contract because the jury found that the reasonable fee for the work the firm performed for a former client before the firm was discharged was $20,750; the city called as witnesses the attorney who represented the city in the client's lawsuit against the city, the firm's managing partner, and the firm's remaining partner, and the client called no witnesses and introduced no evidence but argued that the firm's own evidence presented at the trial showed the firm had performed 90 to 180 hours of work on the case, and suggested that a fee of 100 hours times $200 per hour was a reasonable fee under the contract.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section clearly imports that movant for new trial is entitled to hearing.</b> Shockley v. State, 230 Ga. 869, 199 S.E.2d 791 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial made more than 30 days after entry of judgment</b> is an "extraordinary" motion. Dyal v. State, 121 Ga. App. 50, 172 S.E.2d 326 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extraordinary motions are authorized indirectly</b> by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-40 and 5-5-41. Dick v. State, 248 Ga. 898, 287 S.E.2d 11 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hearing on motion required.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-40 and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>5-5-41, the trial court is required to hold a hearing on a motion for new trial. Dick v. State, 248 Ga. 898, 287 S.E.2d 11 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After the juvenile court found that there was not probable cause to believe the child was dependent, the juvenile court erred in not conducting a hearing on the motion for new trial because the child's motion attacked the juvenile court's evidentiary findings, which was a proper claim of error in such a motion; furthermore, the child requested a hearing on the motion for new trial, and there was nothing in the record suggesting the child later waived the right to that hearing. In the Interest of M. I., 344 Ga. App. 172, 809 S.E.2d 540 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinguished from motion for mistrial.</b> - Trial court's grant of a defendant's motion for a mistrial over two months after a guilty verdict had been returned was void as a mistrial could not be entered after the verdict was returned; motions for mistrial were not to be confused with motions for a new trial, which were appropriate after the verdict was returned, and Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XVIII, provided for double jeopardy protection except when a new trial had been granted after the conviction or in the case of a mistrial. State v. Sumlin, 281 Ga. 183, 637 S.E.2d 36 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Date for hearing on motion for new trial.</b> - When the date for the hearing on a motion for new trial is left blank, the time of the hearing is "indefinite" and the hearing may be heard at any succeeding term. Whitton v. State, 174 Ga. App. 634, 331 S.E.2d 10 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No law requires that motion for new trial be set down for a hearing.</b> McClure v. State, 163 Ga. App. 236, 293 S.E.2d 496 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>There is no law that a motion cannot be summarily heard instanter.</b> McClure v. State, 163 Ga. App. 236, 293 S.E.2d 496 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in hearing motion for new trial immediately after the motion was filed and prior to preparation of transcript and proceedings since the evidence at trial was fresh in the court's memory at that particular point in time. McClure v. State, 163 Ga. App. 236, 293 S.E.2d 496 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No hearing as to extraordinary motion showing no merit.</b> - Extraordinary motion for new trial which fails to show any merit may be denied without the necessity of a hearing. Dick v. State, 248 Ga. 898, 287 S.E.2d 11 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary denial when movant fails to follow procedure.</b> - Due process and equal protection rights are not violated by a trial court's summary denial of a movant's extraordinary motion for new trial when the movant fails to comply with the procedural requirements of state law. Dick v. State, 248 Ga. 898, 287 S.E.2d 11 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Continuance properly denied.</b> - When defense counsel had approximately four months to prepare for the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial and during this time, counsel had access to the entire trial transcript and all matters of record filed with the superior court clerk's office, even though the defendant's counsel may not have had access to the transcripts of the pre-trial hearings, counsel did have ample time to consult with counsel's client, study the evidence presented at trial, and review all of defendant's written pre-trial motions, so the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion to continue. Isbell v. State, 179 Ga. App. 363, 346 S.E.2d 857 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1098, 107 S. Ct. 1319, 94 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tolling.</b> - Time period for filing a notice of appeal is not tolled by an untimely motion for new trial. Dodson v. State, 292 Ga. 790, 741 S.E.2d 639 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Transcript not required when alleged error stems from pleadings.</b> - When error relied upon in motion for new trial is one that appears from pleadings no transcript or brief of evidence is required. Hill v. General Rediscount Corp., 116 Ga. App. 459, 157 S.E.2d 888 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Within discretion of trial judge to set time for filing of transcript</b> of evidence. There is nothing in the statute to indicate that the judge must state the judge's reasons for granting whatever length of time the judge determines is necessary for filing of transcript. The judge knows the volume of litigation in his court, and must be assumed to know whether court reporter is promptly and efficiently discharging his or her duties. Diamond v. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 228 Ga. 533, 186 S.E.2d 741 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Movant's failure to make reasonable effort to secure transcript.</b> - When it appears that transcript of evidence, or lawful substitute therefor is essential to consideration of grounds of motion for judgment n.o.v. or for new trial and neither was produced at time of hearing on motion, and judge found as a fact that movants had not made a reasonable effort to secure it, proper direction to give matter is to dismiss motion. Miller v. Sparks, 124 Ga. App. 4, 183 S.E.2d 88 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the defendants' motion for a new trial was dismissed not because the court reporter took longer than planned to prepare the transcript, but because the defendants failed to either seek and obtain an extension of time for filing the transcript or ensure the transcript was filed there was no abuse of discretion by the court. Myers v. Myers, 195 Ga. App. 529, 394 S.E.2d 374 (1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court has discretion to set the time for filing of the transcript of the evidence, and dismissal of a motion for new trial is appropriate when the transcript is necessary to consideration of the motion, and the movant has made no reasonable effort to secure it. Moore v. Sinclair, 196 Ga. App. 667, 396 S.E.2d 557 (1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Duty upon court reporter not upon litigant.</b> - There is no duty on litigant to take recordings of evidence from reporter and have the recordings transcribed by typists employed by the litigant.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to state facts sufficient for grant of motion.</b> - When the pleadings in an extraordinary motion for new trial in a criminal case do not contain a statement of facts sufficient to authorize that the motion be granted, if the facts developed at the hearing warrant such relief, it is not error for the trial court to refuse to conduct a hearing on the extraordinary motion. Dick v. State, 248 Ga. 898, 287 S.E.2d 11 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Lowry v. State, 171 Ga. App. 118, 318 S.E.2d 744 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of parent's request for transcript of termination hearing.</b> - Parent alleged the trial court erred in denying the parent a copy of the transcript of the hearing on the petition for termination of parental rights for use at a new trial hearing. However, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-40(c), the trial court had discretion to hear and determine the new trial motion before the transcript of evidence and proceedings was prepared and filed. In re D. R., 298 Ga. App. 774, 681 S.E.2d 218 (2009), overruled on other grounds, In re A.C., 285 Ga. 829, 686 S.E.2d 635 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial should have raised issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.</b> - Defendant's convictions for rape, incest, child molestation, and cruelty to children were proper because the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally barred. In order for the defendant's claim of ineffectiveness to have been heard by the appellate court, the defendant's new counsel should have amended the motion for new trial to include a claim for ineffective assistance, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-40; having failed to do so, the defendant failed to preserve the issue for review.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion filed while defendant a fugitive.</b> - Because the defendant was a fugitive when defense counsel filed the defendant's motion for a new trial, the defendant waived the defendant's right to seek such relief, even though the defendant was no longer a fugitive at the time the motion was dismissed; accordingly, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to reinstate the motion for a new trial. Moreover, so long as the defendant remained a fugitive, the defendant's attorney was not entitled to assert the defendant's rights to postconviction relief on the defendant's behalf. Harper v. State, 300 Ga. App. 25, 684 S.E.2d 96 (2009), cert. denied, No. S10C0152, 2010 Ga. LEXIS 7 (Ga. 2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Litigant arguing same issue for tenth time.</b> - In an action which represented the tenth time a litigant had made the same argument that summary disposition of a prior state court case deprived the litigant of the federal Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, a motion for a new trial was properly dismissed, given that: (1) the claims therein had been previously addressed and rejected; (2) Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XII was a right of choice provision, not a right of access provision; and (3) the motion was both untimely under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-40(a), and filed in the wrong county court in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-60(b).

<p class="p4"><b>Motion in custody modification proceeding.</b> - Trial court had authority to add the alcohol-related provisions to the custody order because the mother filed the motion for new trial 21 days after entry of the modification order, which was an ordinary motion for new trial, and the new evidence of the father's drunk driving arrests was material and showed a pattern of behavior justifying the condition.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mandatory procedure must be followed in partition action.</b> - Denial of the appellant's motion for a new trial was reversed because in light of the mandatory language in the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act (UPHPA), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-6-181(b), the trial court erred in not making an initial determination, prior to ordering the parties to mediation, whether the property was heirs property and, if so, it was required to partition the property pursuant to the UPHPA unless all of the cotenants, not just all of the non-defaulting cotenants, otherwise agreed.

<p class="p4"><b>Claim of improper jury communication was required to be brought by habeas corpus.</b> - Defendant's post-appeal challenge to a criminal conviction brought 15 years after the defendant's conviction based on alleged improper communications with the jury that occurred during the trial but that were not brought to the defendant's attention until years later could not be pursued through an extraordinary motion for new trial because such claims involved a deprivation of the defendant's constitutional rights and were required to be pursued exclusively through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When a motion for a new trial is made after the expiration of a 30 day period from the entry of judgment, some good reason must be shown why the motion was not made during such period, which reason shall be judged by the court. In all such cases, 20 days' notice shall be given to the opposite party. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever a motion for a new trial has been made within the 30 day period in any criminal case and overruled or when a motion for a new trial has not been made during such period, no motion for a new trial from the same verdict or judgment shall be made or received unless the same is an extraordinary motion or case; and only one such extraordinary motion shall be made or allowed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this Code section, a person convicted of a felony may file a written motion before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case for the performance of forensic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) The filing of the motion as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not automatically stay an execution. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) The motion shall be verified by the petitioner and shall show or provide the following: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) Evidence that potentially contains deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was obtained in relation to the crime and subsequent indictment, which resulted in his or her conviction; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The evidence was not subjected to the requested DNA testing because the existence of the evidence was unknown to the petitioner or to the petitioner's trial attorney prior to trial or because the technology for the testing was not available at the time of trial; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) The identity of the perpetrator was, or should have been, a significant issue in the case; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(E) A description of the evidence to be tested and, if known, its present location, its origin and the date, time, and means of its original collection; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(F) The results of any DNA or other biological evidence testing that was conducted previously by either the prosecution or the defense, if known; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(G) If known, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons or entities who are known or believed to have possession of any evidence described by subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph, and any persons or entities who have provided any of the information contained in petitioner's motion, indicating which person or entity has which items of evidence or information; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(H) The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons or entities who may testify for the petitioner and a description of the subject matter and summary of the facts to which each person or entity may testify. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) The petitioner shall state: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) That the motion is not filed for the purpose of delay; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) That the issue was not raised by the petitioner or the requested DNA testing was not ordered in a prior proceeding in the courts of this state or the United States. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(5) The motion shall be served upon the district attorney and the Attorney General. The state shall file its response, if any, within 60 days of being served with the motion. The state shall be given notice and an opportunity to respond at any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(6) (A) If, after the state files its response, if any, and the court determines that the motion complies with the requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, the court shall order a hearing to occur after the state has filed its response, but not more than 90 days from the date the motion was filed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The motion shall be heard by the judge who conducted the trial that resulted in the petitioner's conviction unless the presiding judge determines that the trial judge is unavailable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) Upon request of either party, the court may order, in the interest of justice, that the petitioner be at the hearing on the motion. The court may receive additional memoranda of law or evidence from the parties for up to 30 days after the hearing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(D) The petitioner and the state may present evidence by sworn and notarized affidavits or testimony; provided, however, any affidavit shall be served on the opposing party at least 15 days prior to the hearing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(E) The purpose of the hearing shall be to allow the parties to be heard on the issue of whether the petitioner's motion complies with the requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, whether upon consideration of all of the evidence there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different if the results of the requested DNA testing had been available at the time of trial, and whether the requirements of paragraph (7) of this subsection have been established. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(7) The court shall grant the motion for DNA testing if it determines that the petitioner has met the requirements set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection and that all of the following have been established: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) The evidence to be tested is available and in a condition that would permit the DNA testing requested in the motion; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain of custody sufficient to establish that it has not been substituted, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any material respect; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) The evidence was not tested previously or, if tested previously, the requested DNA test would provide results that are reasonably more discriminating or probative of the identity of the perpetrator than prior test results; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(D) The motion is not made for the purpose of delay; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(E) The identity of the perpetrator of the crime was a significant issue in the case; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(F) The testing requested employs a scientific method that has reached a scientific state of verifiable certainty such that the procedure rests upon the laws of nature; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(G) The petitioner has made a prima facie showing that the evidence sought to be tested is material to the issue of the petitioner's identity as the perpetrator of, or accomplice to, the crime, aggravating circumstance, or similar transaction that resulted in the conviction. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(8) If the court orders testing pursuant to this subsection, the court shall determine the method of testing and responsibility for payment for the cost of testing, if necessary, and may require the petitioner to pay the costs of testing if the court determines that the petitioner has the ability to pay. If the petitioner is indigent, the cost shall be paid from the fine and bond forfeiture fund as provided in Article 3 of Chapter 21 of Title 15. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(9) If the court orders testing pursuant to this subsection, the court shall order that the evidence be tested by the Division of Forensic Sciences of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. In addition, the court may also authorize the testing of the evidence by a laboratory that meets the standards of the DNA advisory board established pursuant to the DNA Identification Act of 1994, Section 14131 of Title 42 of the United States Code, to conduct the testing. The court shall order that a sample of the petitioner's DNA be submitted to the Division of Forensic Sciences of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and that the DNA analysis be stored and maintained by the bureau in the DNA data bank. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(10) If a motion is filed pursuant to this subsection the court shall order the state to preserve during the pendency of the proceeding all evidence that contains biological material, including, but not limited to, stains, fluids, or hair samples in the state's possession or control. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(11) The result of any test ordered under this subsection shall be fully disclosed to the petitioner, the district attorney, and the Attorney General. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(12) The judge shall set forth by written order the rationale for the grant or denial of the motion for new trial filed pursuant to this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Motions for DNA testing.</b> - Trial court properly denied the inmate's pro se motion for DNA testing, which was filed 20 years after that inmate was convicted of aggravated sodomy and rape, as the identity of the perpetrator of the rape was not a significant issue in the case, and the inmate failed to satisfy all elements under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41(c) to warrant that relief. Williams v. State, 289 Ga. App. 856, 658 S.E.2d 446 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since the defendant's renewed request for DNA testing did not involve any new testing, it was not properly a request for DNA testing made pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41(c), nor was the motion granted pursuant to that statute and, thus, it was in the nature of a post-trial discovery request.

<p class="p4"><b>"Good reason" for motion.</b> - Normally, the "good reason" necessary to permit the filing of an extraordinary motion for a new trial consists of newly discovered evidence, but the late filing of a motion for a new trial may also be predicated on circumstances other than newly discovered evidence. Martin v. Children's Sesame, Inc., 188 Ga. App. 242, 372 S.E.2d 648 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in concluding that the late filing of a motion was supported by "good reason" when the clerk's office incorrectly informed the movants of the filing date on two occasions and where the motion would have been timely had the clerk's representations been correct.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appeal from decision rendered on merits following granting of out-of-time motion.</b> - Even though the defendant did not timely file a motion for a new trial because the defendant did not file such a motion within 30 days of the entry of conviction and the imposition of sentence, the state supreme court had jurisdiction to hear the defendant's appeal as the trial court granted permission to the defendant to file an out-of-time motion for a new trial and denied that motion on the motion's merits following a hearing, and, thus, the defendant was entitled to file a direct appeal to the appropriate reviewing court. Washington v. State, 276 Ga. 655, 581 S.E.2d 518 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate jurisdiction.</b> - When the plaintiff filed an extraordinary motion for new trial, which the trial court denied, appellate jurisdiction existed; although no ruling on the motion was contained in the record on appeal or requested in the notice of appeal, the trial court implicitly granted permission to file the motion by expressly recognizing the plaintiff's pleading as both a request to file an out-of-time motion for new trial and as a motion for new trial, by holding an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the motion for new trial, and by denying the motion for new trial on the motion's merits.

<p class="p4"><b>State has right to direct appeal.</b> - State could directly appeal from an order granting defendant's post-conviction motion for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing by an uncertified laboratory because the defendant filed only a post-conviction motion and did not file an extraordinary motion for new trial; the trial court had ruled on the merits of the only pending motion, there was no issue remaining, and a direct appeal would not create absurd results.

<p class="p4"><b>Trial judge acts as trier of fact in passing upon grounds of motion.</b> - When verdict is attacked in a motion for new trial because of the prejudice of a juror, and issue is formed by evidence introduced by parties upon motion, judge is trier, and, unless there is an abuse of discretion, the judge's finding against the movant and in favor of impartiality of the juror is to be treated as final.

<p class="p4">Trial judge occupies position of trier when passing upon ground of extraordinary motion for new trial in criminal case, based upon alleged bias of a juror; the judge's finding that a juror was impartial will not be reversed, unless it is apparent that the judge has abused the discretion which the law vests in the judge in such cases.

<p class="p4"><b>Nature of new evidence.</b> - Trial judge, in passing on extraordinary motion for new trial, must determine whether evidence would likely produce different result upon another trial and whether facts could have been obtained before the verdict by the exercise of ordinary diligence.

<p class="p4">After one accused of a crime has been convicted, and has made a motion for new trial, and judgment denying the motion has been affirmed by the Supreme Court, when extraordinary motion for new trial is made, based on the ground of newly discovered evidence, it should be made to appear that such evidence is so material that it would probably produce a different verdict.

<p class="p4"><b>Although DNA evidence was material, due diligence was not shown.</b> - Defendant's motion for new trial on the basis of newly-discovered evidence (a co-defendant's DNA inside gloves, and the sexual assault victim said that her assailant wore gloves) was denied because, although this evidence was so material that it would probably produce a different verdict, the defendant failed to show due diligence in discovering the evidence: defendant was aware of the existence of the gloves at the time of trial. Bharadia v. State, 297 Ga. 567, 774 S.E.2d 90 (June 29, 2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>DNA testing material potentially degraded.</b> - Trial court misapplied the law in determining whether the inmate satisfied the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41(c)(7), when the court determined that the biological material sought to be DNA tested may have degraded as the court was charged with determining if the pants were in a condition that would allow for the test to be conducted and if the inmate had established a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different it the results of the DNA testing sought had been available at trial.

<p class="p4"><b>Will discovered subsequent to judgment probating another will.</b> - Petition to court of ordinary (now probate court) to set aside the judgment probating a will in solemn form on the ground that the later will has been discovered since rendition of the judgment, is analogous to but is not an extraordinary motion for new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence.

<p class="p4"><b>Hearing motion requires transcript or brief of evidence.</b> - In order for extraordinary motion for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence to be a valid motion, it must appear that newly discovered evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, and that it would likely produce a different result. None of these requirements can be determined without examination of evidence adduced upon original trial of case. Absent either transcript or brief of evidence adduced at original trial, court cannot make determination it is required to make by referring to only part of evidence. Dyal v. State, 121 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for motion.</b> - A movant's extraordinary motion for a new trial based on recently discovered evidence must satisfy the court: (1) that newly discovered evidence has come to the movant's attention since his trial; (2) that want of due diligence was not the reason that his evidence was not acquired sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would produce probably a different verdict; (4) that it was not cumulative only; (5) that the affidavit of the witness is attached to the motion or its absence is sufficiently explained; and (6) that the new evidence does not operate solely to impeach the credit of a witness. The motion must set forth facts to meet these requirements; conclusions of counsel will not suffice. Dick v. State, 248 Ga. 898, 287 S.E.2d 11 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of motion did not amount to abuse of discretion.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's extraordinary motion for new trial without a hearing as: (1) the alleged newly-discovered evidence was not so material that the evidence would likely result in a different verdict; (2) the affidavits presented lacked the type of materiality required to support a new trial as the affidavits did not show the witnesses's trial testimony to have been the purest fabrication; (3) the defendant failed to act diligently in presenting the affidavits alleged to have supported the motion; (4) the trial court favored the original testimony, and as such, could not disregard the jury's verdict; and (5) the defendant failed to present the facts necessary to warrant a hearing on the motion.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's extraordinary motion for a new trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41 because the codefendant's testimony at the hearing would probably not have produced a different result in the guilt/innocence phase if it had been presented at the defendant's trial; the defendant did not demonstrate that the defendant took diligent steps to ascertain what testimony the codefendant could have been willing to give during the more than 17 years since the codefendant's trial.

<p class="p4"><b>Claim of innocence in habeas petition was not a constitutional claim.</b> - Petitioner, a death row inmate, argued in a federal habeas petition as a separate claim for relief that the petitioner was actually innocent, but that claim failed because actual innocence was not itself a constitutional claim, and was instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner had to pass to have the petitioner's otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits; further, the claim was not properly before the federal court, as the inmate could pursue a claim of actual innocence in state court by filing an extraordinary motion for new trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-23, 5-5-40, and 5-5-41.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Types of fact situations contemplated by statute.</b> - Cases contemplated by statute are such as do not ordinarily occur in transaction of human affairs, as when a man has been convicted of murder, and it afterwards turns out that the man the defendant was charged with having killed is still alive, or when a man has been convicted on testimony of a witness who is afterwards found guilty of perjury in giving that testimony, or from some providential cause, and cases of like character.

<p class="p4"><b>DNA testing motion did not follow appointment of federal habeas counsel.</b> - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) motion and an extraordinary motion for a new trial did not ordinarily follow the appointment of counsel in a federal habeas petition and thus were not subject to funding under 18 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 3599; the filing of the inmate's DNA motion had nothing to do with exhausting a federal constitutional claim in state court so that the district court could consider the claim on the merits in adjudicating the inmate's 28 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 2254 petition. The inmate's claim that the inmate was entitled to DNA testing as a matter of Georgia law was not, and could not have been, included as a claim in the inmate's <span class="s1">§</span> 2254 petition.

<p class="p4"><b>Witnesses present at trial cannot be basis of motion.</b> - Extraordinary motion for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence is properly refused, if it appears that witnesses whose evidence is alleged to have been newly discovered were subpoenaed by the defendant, were in attendance upon court, and were not sworn by the defendant. King v. State, 174 Ga. 432, 163 S.E. 168 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Statute does not authorize second motion when first motion complaining of same verdict is pending.</b> - When motion for new trial is pending in superior court, there is no provision of law authorizing the movant to file a second separate original motion for new trial complaining of the same verdict, nor would instance of that character be comprehended by the statute. Harper v. Perry, 190 Ga. 233, 9 S.E.2d 160 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of extraordinary motion to set aside divorce decree precludes subsequent equitable petition on same grounds.</b> - When, after final verdict and decree for divorce, extraordinary motion for new trial is denied on merits of grounds, under conflicting evidence, such judgment precludes movant from maintaining subsequent equitable petition between same parties to set aside decree, based on substantially same grounds as those contained in former motion.

<p class="p4"><b>Juror misconduct.</b> - New trial pursuant to extraordinary motion was unavailable on the ground of juror misconduct when the motion was supported by the testimony of only one juror some four years after the defendant's conviction, and the alleged misconduct of two jurors was not so prejudicial that the verdict lacked due process. Satterwhite v. State, 235 Ga. App. 687, 509 S.E.2d 97 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Juror qualification.</b> - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs' extraordinary motion for new trial based on an auto company's misleading discovery responses with regard to liability insurance because they acted with due diligence to raise their claim that the jury should have been qualified as to the auto company's insurers and the failure to do so raised an unrebutted presumption that they were materially harmed. Ford Motor Co. v. Conley, 294 Ga. 530, 757 S.E.2d 20 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to disclose insurance providers necessitated new trial.</b> - In a negligence and wrongful death action, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by granting the plaintiffs' extraordinary motion for new trial after it was discovered that the defendant had excess insurance that was not disclosed as it was determined that the defendant failed to disclose the insurance providers in the consolidated pre-trial order so that jurors could be fully qualified as to any relationship with the insurance providers. Reese v. Ford Motor Co., 320 Ga. App. 78, 738 S.E.2d 301 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>After defendant's conviction has been affirmed on appeal, extraordinary motion for new trial is one of three available remedies.</b> - Petitioner's motion to vacate the petitioner's conviction was not an appropriate remedy in a criminal case after petitioner's murder conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal. The court overruled Division 2 of Chester v. State, 284 Ga. 162 (2008), which had allowed such motions under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-9-4, and held that in order to challenge a conviction after the conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal, petitioner was required to file an extraordinary motion for new trial, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41, a motion in arrest of judgment, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-9-61, or a petition for habeas corpus under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-14-40.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New DNA evidence.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by granting the defendant a new trial based on newly discovered DNA evidence because the defendant satisfied the due diligence requirement of Timberlake as the record supported the trial court's determination that the ties and belt were not available to the defendant for DNA testing and analysis until 2015. The state's records and testimony given in a 2002 evidentiary hearing indicated that the belt and ties admitted in the 1977 trial were destroyed by the GBI in 1979, the items were not rediscovered by the defendant's attorneys until 2015, and touch DNA testing and analysis did not exist at the time of the 1977 trial.

<p class="p6"><b>3. When Extraordinary Motion Unavailable</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Matters known or discoverable prior to original motion.</b> - Extraordinary motions for new trial cannot be based upon matters that were known to movant in time to have had the matters stated in the original motion, or that could have been discovered in time by proper diligence. Allen v. State, 88 Ga. App. 200, 76 S.E.2d 531 (1953); Barfield v. McEntyre, 136 Ga. App. 294, 221 S.E.2d 58 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">State of facts underlying extraordinary motion must have been unknown to movant or the movant's counsel at time when ordinary motion for new trial could have been filed, and must have been impossible to ascertain by exercise of proper diligence for that purpose. Gilpin v. Swainsboro Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 75 Ga. App. 574, 44 S.E.2d 168 (1947); Cade v. State, 107 Ga. App. 30, 129 S.E.2d 405 (1962); Patterson v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Errors known at time of direct appeal.</b> - When absence of transcript of prosecutor's closing arguments was a matter known to defense counsel at the time of the defendant's direct appeal, all alleged errors premised upon the absence of that transcript should have been enumerated in that appeal and cannot now be raised by an extraordinary motion for new trial. Blake v. State, 244 Ga. 466, 260 S.E.2d 876 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 988, 100 S. Ct. 2974, 64 L. Ed. 2d 846 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Reviewing grounds of ordinary motion filed after prescribed time.</b> - When denial of motion for new trial is affirmed, either on merits or from lack of jurisdiction due to failure to file within time allowed by statute for review, extraordinary motion for new trial will not lie to review any grounds in original motion even though some such grounds may be meritorious.

<p class="p4"><b>No special circumstances were present justifying an extraordinary motion</b> for a new trial based on proffered testimony of defendant's codefendant who had invoked the codefendant's Fifth Amendment right not to testify at the prior trial and who had pled guilty and been sentenced in the interim because the substance of the testimony was not in fact new evidence since it was always known by the defendant, and the witness lacked credibility since the witness had nothing to lose by testifying untruthfully regarding the alleged innocence of the defendant.

<p class="p4"><b>Prior motion for new trial.</b> - Defendant's pleading, which sought an out-of-time appeal under circumstances where such an appeal was not permitted, could not be considered an extraordinary motion for new trial since the defendant had already filed such a motion in 1992 and was statutorily limited to filing one such motion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41(b).

<p class="p4"><b>Unless time is fixed, service should be in ample time for preparation for hearing.</b> - When rule nisi granted upon application for new trial, or in any order passed continuing hearing upon motion for new trial, there is no limitation of period within which service of rule nisi or other order should be perfected, such service as will give opposite party a reasonable opportunity to prepare for hearing upon motion for new trial and to resist the hearing is sufficient service.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compliance prior to second hearing with order issued regarding first hearing was sufficient.</b> - Rule nisi granted on motion for new trial set hearing for fixed date, and directed that motion be served on opposite party "five days prior to the hearing." On the date fixed for the hearing the trial judge granted an order postponing the hearing to a later date, making no other order as to service. The motion for a new trial was not served five days before the date fixed for the first hearing, but it was duly served five days prior to the date as fixed for the subsequent order of postponement. The court held this was sufficient. Johnson v. State, 4 Ga. App. 850, 62 S.E. 540 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Carmichael v. City of Jackson, 194 Ga. 664, 22 S.E.2d 470 (1942); Almon v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 108 Ga. App. 799, 134 S.E.2d 435 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Codefendant who has interest in sustaining verdict is entitled to notice.</b> - When codefendant has an interest in sustaining the verdict of the jury and judgment of the court, the codefendant is a necessary party to a motion for new trial and must be served with a copy of the rule nisi.

Dunn v. Dunn, 221 Ga. 368, 144 S.E.2d 758 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When rule nisi, issued upon filing of motion for new trial, was not served on respondent, and service was not expressly waived, but agreement was made in open court by counsel for respondent, to passage of order setting hearing upon motion at designated time and place, which agreement was recited in order, and counsel for respondent afterwards appeared at time and place set for hearing on motion, these facts amount to waiver by respondent, through counsel, of service of rule nisi. Beeland v. Butler-Payne Lumber Co., 44 Ga. App. 603, 162 S.E. 303 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of judge to dismiss untimely served motion.</b> - When time fixed for hearing arrives, and no service has been effected, it is generally a matter in sound discretion of trial judge whether to dismiss motion or to continue final hearing until service is perfected. Webb v. Nobles, 195 Ga. 287, 24 S.E.2d 27 (1943); Trammell v. Throgmorton, 210 Ga. 659, 82 S.E.2d 140 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment dismissing motion for new trial, on motion of respondent made at time set for hearing, is not an abuse of trial court's discretion when there has been no personal service on respondent or any waiver of such service. Braziel v. Hunter, 103 Ga. App. 854, 121 S.E.2d 39 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When there was neither service nor written waiver of service upon opposite party of rule nisi issued in connection with motion for new trial, and when, at first opportunity and before either expressly or impliedly consented to completion of motion or judicial consideration upon the motion's merits, the respondent moved to dismiss the proceeding for want of such service, court did not err in dismissing the motion.

<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal when no rule nisi served, and requirement not waived.</b> - When the defendant files a motion for new trial, but no rule nisi is attached nor copy of the rule nisi served upon the state, nor does the state waive this requirement, there is no abuse of discretion by the trial court in dismissing the defendant's motion for new trial.

Henry v. State, 20 Ga. App. 742, 93 S.E. 311 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of grant of new trial by Supreme Court</b> is to require case to be heard de novo unless specific direction be given in regard thereto. Leventhal v. Baumgartner, 209 Ga. 404, 73 S.E.2d 194 (1952); Baker v. Decatur Lumber &amp; Supply Co., 210 Ga. 805, 82 S.E.2d 820 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When issues tried by jury were upon exceptions to an auditor's fact findings.</b> - When, after rendition of verdict and judgment, new trial is granted, case stands upon docket for trial as if there had been no trial. This applies when case which was one at law had been referred to auditor, and issues tried by jury were upon exceptions to auditor's findings on facts. Mayor of Monroe v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 50 Ga. App. 865, 178 S.E. 767 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When evidence adduced at first trial entitled movant to recovery as matter of law.</b> - Statute applies notwithstanding that, under law of case as laid down by appellate court when reversing judgment of trial court and granting new trial, party at whose instance new trial was granted is, under evidence adduced upon trial, entitled, as a matter of law, to recovery. Scott v. Powell Paving Co., 43 Ga. App. 705, 159 S.E. 895 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When case reversed, evidence sufficiency not addressed.</b> - Enumerations of error relating to sufficiency of evidence will not be addressed on appeal when a case is reversed, since new or additional evidence may be presented at a new trial. Vitello v. Stott, 222 Ga. App. 134, 473 S.E.2d 504 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testimony rendered at first trial cannot be ground for dismissal of second trial.</b> - Testimony, by reason of rendition at one trial, does not operate as admission in judicio which would as a matter of law preclude recovery upon subsequent trial. Scott v. Powell Paving Co., 43 Ga. App. 705, 159 S.E. 895 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even when a new trial has been granted on ground that, under testimony of plaintiff personally, plaintiff was as a matter of law not entitled to recover, case stands on docket for trial as though no trial had been had and it is error for court, on call of case for second trial, to dismiss the case upon motion of the defendant, on ground that testimony of the plaintiff as adduced on former trial of case operated to preclude recovery by the plaintiff. Cook v. Attapulgus Clay Co., 52 Ga. App. 610, 184 S.E. 334 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although testimony of party to case may as a matter of law preclude recovery in the party's favor, it does so only as respects trial at which testimony is rendered and is not grounds for dismissal of new trial, because after new trial has been granted, case stands in posture of de novo proceeding as though no trial had been had. Napier v. Napier, 221 Ga. 813, 147 S.E.2d 422, appeal dismissed, 222 Ga. 681, 151 S.E.2d 712 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grant of directed verdict authorized.</b> - At a second trial following the grant of plaintiff's motion for a new trial, the trial court was authorized to dismiss the defendant's counterclaims and grant a directed verdict for the plaintiff. Tyson v. Cheek Mechanical &amp; Elec. Serv., Inc., 218 Ga. App. 134, 460 S.E.2d 536 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party's contradictory testimony from first trial is considered extrajudicial admission or impeaching testimony.</b> - Party to case who has testified on former trial of that case may, upon subsequent trial of same case, give testimony in contradiction of that party's testimony given upon former trial, and, when so testifying, that party's testimony upon former trial is, when introduced in evidence on subsequent trial, in nature of an extrajudicial admission or impeaching testimony, whose probative value is for the jury. Scott v. Powell Paving Co., 43 Ga. App. 705, 159 S.E. 895 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While party's testimony at first trial may have been different from the party's testimony at the second trial, and may be introduced as an admission or impeaching testimony, it will be for the jury to determine the testimony's probative value. Cook v. Attapulgus Clay Co., 52 Ga. App. 610, 184 S.E. 334 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge on second trial cannot be based on evidence or requests from first trial.</b> - Notwithstanding plaintiff in error in first trial made written request for charge on law of undue influence, nevertheless upon second trial it was error for trial judge to charge on that subject when there was no evidence to authorize charge on undue influence. Leventhal v. Baumgartner, 209 Ga. 404, 73 S.E.2d 194 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delay in paying costs.</b> - Delay of slightly more than 30 days in paying the bill of costs because of appellant's medical condition was properly found to be neither unreasonable nor inexcusable. Poythress v. Savannah Airport Comm'n, 229 Ga. App. 303, 494 S.E.2d 76 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to conduct new trial.</b> - On remand, because the only relief sought by a distributor in a contract action with a buyer was a new trial, the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the distributor without conducting a new trial; moreover, the buyer was not foreclosed from presenting additional or different evidence in support of its claim for lost profits in the trial. Strickland &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Williamson, 281 Ga. App. 784, 637 S.E.2d 170 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reconsideration not required.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-48 did not require de novo reconsideration of rulings made prior to the first trial, particularly when there was no contention that additional evidence or changed circumstances would justify altering the prior ruling. Trimble v. State, 297 Ga. 180, 773 S.E.2d 188 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assuming that motions for immunity under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">Ý</span> 16-3-24.2 were required to be made before trial, the defendant was entitled to file the defendant's motion after the grant of a new trial because it was as though no trial had been had under O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">Ý</span> 5-5-48.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction with </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>5-5-48. - Former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 6094-6098 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-5-48 and 5-5-49) related relate to trial of cases in which new trials have been granted, and must be construed together. Henry v. State, 20 Ga. App. 742, 93 S.E. 311 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of noncompliance.</b> - Noncompliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-49 does not result in the automatic acquittal of a defendant in a criminal case. In the absence of language clearly evidencing a legislative intent to effectuate such a broad divestiture of jurisdiction, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-49 must be construed as merely directory. Butler v. State, 207 Ga. App. 824, 429 S.E.2d 280 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of remittitur in clerk's office is prerequisite to reacquisition of jurisdiction by trial court.</b> - If trial court does not acquire jurisdiction by filing of remittitur in clerk's office, the court is without authority to take any steps in the case, and has no more right to pass order formally making judgment of the Supreme Court its judgment than the Supreme Court had, without so doing, to proceed with trial. Hagan v. Robert &amp; Co. Assocs., 222 Ga. 469, 150 S.E.2d 663 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent is that entry of remittitur restores trial court's jurisdiction.</b> - Unless filing of remittitur in office of trial court operates to restore at once to that court the court's former jurisdiction over cases, they ought not to be redocketed when remittitur is so filed, and requirement that they immediately be redocketed when remittitur is entered conclusively shows that it was intention of the legislature that trial court's jurisdiction over cases should be restored when mandate of reviewing court reached it through prescribed procedure. Hagan v. Robert &amp; Co. Assocs., 222 Ga. 469, 150 S.E.2d 663 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remittitur need not be made judgment of trial court before clerk redockets case.</b> - Statute cannot possibly mean that remittitur must be made judgment of trial court and spread upon the court's minutes before the clerk of that court proceeds to redocket cases. On the contrary, it contemplates that cases shall be immediately entered upon docket of the trial court, in order that judge, on reaching cases in the cases' regular order, can dispose of the cases by carrying into effect the judgment rendered by reviewing court. Hagan v. Robert &amp; Co. Assocs., 222 Ga. 469, 150 S.E.2d 663 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reversal neither serves as substitute for findings for appellant nor enlarges trial judge's powers.</b> - Judgment of reversal, without more, operates only to vacate orders and decree as therein stated, and to reinvest trial court with jurisdiction on filing of remittitur in office of clerk of trial court. It neither serves as a substitute for findings for appellant, nor enlarges powers of trial judge in reference thereto. Holton v. Lankford, 189 Ga. 506, 6 S.E.2d 304 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of reversal without express direction to lower court.</b> - When on return of remittitur in case in which there was judgment of reversal but not express direction of Supreme Court to lower court, the case stands as reversed, and a new trial must be had on issues therein raised since the case illegally terminated. Rawdin v. Conner, 211 Ga. 52, 84 S.E.2d 50 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reversal for refusal of nonsuit (now dismissal) or new trial does not put case out of court.</b> - When error assigned on overruling of demurrer (now motion to dismiss), refusal to grant nonsuit, and overruling motion for new trial, judgment of reversal will not put case out of court as on nonsuit. Louisville &amp; N.R.R. v. Ramsay, 137 Ga. 573, 73 S.E. 847, 1913B Ann. Cas. 108 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to move to dismiss counterclaim.</b> - Because a landlord chose not to move to dismiss a tenant's counterclaim at the first bench trial on the specific ground that the tenant failed to prove the amount of damages for its attorney-fees counterclaim, the tenant was not alerted to the need to reopen the tenant's case to cure the problem, and the landlord's decision meant that following reversal and remand, the trial court was required to allow the tenant to prove those fees at a second trial.

<p class="p4"><b>Court lacks jurisdiction to consider oral motion for new trial.</b> - When motion for new trial is made orally, there is no legal motion for new trial before the court, and the court is without jurisdiction to entertain or consider the motion.

<p class="p4"><b>When reviewable judgment becomes final.</b> - Reviewable judgment does not become final, however, until time prescribed by law for appealing the judgment has passed, or if appealed, until such judgment is affirmed by the appellate court and judgment of the appellate court is made the judgment of the trial court.

<p class="p4"><b>New trials on evidentiary grounds when no evidence supports verdict.</b> - Discretion to grant or refuse motions for new trials because a verdict is strongly and decidedly against the weight of the evidence rests solely in the presiding judge, and while the appellate division of the Municipal Court of Atlanta may, as any other court of review, grant a new trial when there is no evidence to support the verdict, when there was some evidence on which the verdict could be based, and such verdict had the approval of the trial judge, the appellate division of the Municipal Court of Atlanta erred in granting a new trial.

<p class="p4"><b>New trial proper following independent evaluations.</b> - Grant of a new trial was affirmed because the successor judge thoroughly reviewed the case, and presided over a full hearing in the matter.

<p class="p4"><b>New trial properly granted when credibility of witnesses is issue.</b> - Although the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the defendant's conviction, the trial court did not err in exercising the court's discretion to grant a new trial under the general grounds as the case rested entirely upon the credibility of the defendant, the victim, and the witnesses, and the appellate court was constrained by existing precedent to conclude that the trial court did not abuse the court's broad discretion in granting the defendant's new trial on the general grounds. State v. Byrd, 341 Ga. App. 421, 801 S.E.2d 99 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New trial improper when party failed to exercise reasonable diligence.</b> - Trial court erred in granting appellees new trials based on a Brady violation because the appellees had the medical examiner's report at issue in the appellees' possession before trial and had the appellees' exercised reasonable diligence, the appellees would have realized that the second page was missing based on the pagination and could have obtained that page for a co-indictee prior to the appellees' trial.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate courts will not closely scrutinize facts with view to detecting abuses of discretion.</b> - First grant of new trial will not be reversed unless it plainly and manifestly appears that there was an abuse of discretion by court below, and court will not closely scrutinize facts in evidence or endeavor to balance with great exactness the testimony on both sides, with view to detecting abuse of discretion by the trial judge. Exercise of discretion in favor of granting new trials should be encouraged. Baker v. McGarr, 187 Ga. 533, 1 S.E.2d 403 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Scope of discretion of judge not presiding at trial is narrower than presiding judge's discretion.</b> - Scope within which discretion may be exercised, in consideration of evidence, by judge who did not preside at trial is not as extensive as in case of judge who heard and observed witnesses, and who, in a sense, is to be considered as thirteenth member of jury. Brice &amp; Co. v. Whitehurst &amp; Hilliard, 8 Ga. App. 291, 68 S.E. 1075 (1910), later appeal, 14 Ga. App. 209, 80 S.E. 670 (1914); Throgmorton v. Trammell, 90 Ga.

<p class="p4">After the defendant was found guilty of felony murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting death of the defendant's ex-husband, the trial court properly exercised the court's discretion to grant the defendant a new trial on the general grounds because the court concluded that the jury's guilty verdicts were decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence and contrary to the principles of justice and equity; and the supreme court would not disturb the first grant of a new trial based on the general grounds unless the trial court abused the court's discretion in granting it and the law and the facts demanded the verdict rendered.

Georgia S. &amp; F. Ry. v. Bryan, 15 Ga. App. 253, 82 S.E. 913 (1914); Williams v. State, 27 Ga. App. 224, 107 S.E. 620 (1921); Throgmorton v. Trammell, 90 Ga.

<p class="p4">Only question appellate courts will consider on appeal of first grant of new trial is whether verdict as rendered was demanded as a matter of law. Bass v. Pharr, 98 Ga. App. 125, 105 S.E.2d 236 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">When the conflict in evidence could have been resolved in favor of either party, and evidence did not demand a verdict for the defendant, in absence of showing of manifest abuse of discretion on part of the trial court in the court's first grant of new trial, the court's judgment will not be disturbed. Lanier v. Collins, 91 Ga. App. 486, 85 S.E.2d 788 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">First grant of new trial on general grounds will not be disturbed by reviewing court, when the reviewing court cannot say that evidence demands finding that debt in question has been paid despite the jury finding that it had been, and when the movant specifically points out evidence and reasons why the movant claimed the verdict is not supported by the evidence. Dunn v. Gilbert, 217 Ga. 358, 122 S.E.2d 93 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When facts do not require verdict in amount rendered.</b> - When verdict is for unliquidated damages, it is not error to grant new trial even though verdict for the plaintiff in some amount may be demanded, since facts do not require the verdict in the amount rendered. Robinson v. Modern Coach Corp., 91 Ga. App. 440, 85 S.E.2d 826 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that evidence as to damages is vague.</b> - When there was abundant evidence to support a finding that the contract had been breached, which would have entitled the plaintiff to nominal damages at least the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in first grant of a new trial, even though evidence was vague as to amount of damages resulting from breach. Robbins v. Hays, 107 Ga. App. 12, 128 S.E.2d 546 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standard used in reviewing denial of judgment n.o.v. applies.</b> - In determining whether the verdict was demanded, the reviewing court must measure issues by the same strict standard which would apply had the situation been reversed, and had plaintiff in error appealed from the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict following denial of the motion to direct a verdict in the plaintiff's favor. Robbins v. Hays, 107 Ga. App. 12, 128 S.E.2d 546 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Only in those cases when a motion for judgment n.o.v. would have been sustained if the litigant had lost the litigant's case will the grant of a first new trial be error when in fact the litigant won the case.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of statute is to discourage frivolous appeals.</b> Dickey v. Millen Fertilizer Co., 18 Ga. App. 629, 89 S.E. 1098 (1916); Thompson Enters., Inc. v. Coskrey, 168 Ga. App. 181, 308 S.E.2d 399 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages awarded pursuant to section serve dual purpose.</b> - Damages are given not only as penalty upon plaintiff in error, but also as compensation for delay, cost, and vexation occasioned thereby to the defendant in error. Hardy v. Truitt, 20 Ga. App. 529, 93 S.E. 149 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute is properly invoked when courts are used to evade judgments.</b> - When courts are used to evade judgments, especially when effort is made on frivolous grounds, after full opportunity has been had for fair adjudication, this statute in nature of penalty is properly invoked. Felker v. Johnson, 189 Ga. 797, 7 S.E.2d 668 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Justice demands damages award when appeal is obviously frivolous.</b> - When record discloses that the plaintiff in error has no just case, that no new question of law is involved, and the record is full of those things which every judge and every lawyer recognizes as indicia of an attempt to fight merely for time, justice demands that the court overcome any personal hesitancy the court may have, and that it add an award of damages to the judgment of affirmance. Prattes v. Southeast Ceramics, Inc., 132 Ga. App. 584, 208 S.E.2d 600 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When motion for 10 percent damages is filed, court shall carefully examine record,</b> and pass upon motion in light of entire history of the case as there presented. Prattes v.

<p class="p4"><b>Filing of enumeration of errors is essential to completion of appeal.</b> James v. Seritt, 121 Ga. App. 783, 175 S.E.2d 163 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for sum not representing 10 percent of damages dismissed.</b> - Motion for imposition of $5,000 damages for filing a frivolous appeal will be denied when this sum does not represent 10 percent of the amount of damages awarded by the court below.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of Appeals opinions binding on trial court.</b> - Trial court, regardless of the court's good intentions, cannot decide to disregard the opinions of the Court of Appeals. Eastgate Assocs. v. Piggly Wiggly S., Inc., 200 Ga. App. 872, 410 S.E.2d 129, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 896, 410 S.E.2d 129 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Second appeal cannot enlarge scope of first appeal.</b> - Party cannot, on a second appeal, by challenging the judgment entered on remittitur, enlarge the scope of the previous appeal. Womack Indus., Inc. v. B &amp; A Equip. Co., 204 Ga. App. 32, 418 S.E.2d 411 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remittitur, whenever presented, is proper evidence to court below of decision</b> of Supreme Court, and decision thus evidenced is to be respected and in good faith carried into effect. Hartley v. Hartley, 212 Ga. 62, 90 S.E.2d 555 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cases are "sent back" to trial court by transmittal</b> and filing of remittitur in clerk's office. Hagan v. Robert &amp; Co. Assocs., 222 Ga. 469, 150 S.E.2d 663 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of remittitur immediately reestablishes jurisdiction.</b> - Filing of a remittitur in the office of the clerk of a trial court immediately reinvests the court with jurisdiction for all purposes over the case to which such remittitur relates, though good practice requires that the trial court cause the remittitur to be entered upon the trial court's minutes. Chambers v. State, 262 Ga. 200, 415 S.E.2d 643 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrying remittitur into effect is not discretionary</b> with presiding judge, but is a matter of statutory mandate and compulsion. Hartley v. Hartley, 212 Ga. 62, 90 S.E.2d 555 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court cannot vary or modify direction given.</b> - When in affirming judgment, the Supreme Court gives direction to the trial court to amend the trial court's decree in a certain specified manner, trial court on receipt of remittitur has no power or discretion to vary or modify direction given, but must enter judgment in compliance with instructions contained therein. Estes v. Estes, 206 Ga. 530, 57 S.E.2d 587 (1950); Akins v. State, 237 Ga. 826, 229 S.E.2d 645 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Awarding costs upon return of remittitur which makes no reference to costs.</b> - It is within supreme jurisdiction of judge of superior court, upon return of remittitur in case brought by bill of exceptions (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-49 and 5-6-50) to Supreme Court, and in which no reference is made to subject of costs in cases to incorporate in judgment costs allowed by law as costs in Supreme Court, as well as costs of officers of superior court for their services in transmission of bill of exceptions and transcript of record to Supreme Court.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure to file appellate court's order.</b> - When the trial court which originally reentered summary judgment lacks jurisdiction over the case, the remittitur of the appellate court remanding for the entry of a new order not having been filed with the clerk of the lower court, the trial court's order is a nullity. Talley v. City Tank Corp., 158 Ga. App. 130, 279 S.E.2d 264 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court was without jurisdiction to order the defendant to appear for trial when remittitur had not been filed. Nave v. State, 171 Ga. App. 165, 318 S.E.2d 753 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lower court could not entertain successive motion for new trial.</b> - Appellate reversal of the trial court's grant of a new trial in a prior appeal from the defendant's murder conviction resolved all pending issues in the case; the trial court therefore erred in entertaining and granting the defendant's newly-filed motion for new trial on different grounds.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If six judges would affirm and six would not.</b> - In a review of a denial of a motion to suppress, six judges of the Georgia Court of Appeals would have affirmed, and six would not; because there was an equal division, the Court of Appeals should have immediately transferred the case to the Supreme Court of Georgia, pursuant to Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. V, Para. V. The judges' differences of opinion about whether the judgment of the trial court should be set aside as "reversed" or instead as "vacated" were not dispositive.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Effect of Affirmance</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Affirmance denies trial court jurisdiction to grant new trial.</b> - When judgment was entered for the plaintiff, who then filed a notice of appeal, and the defendant then filed a cross appeal as well as a motion for new trial in the trial court, and the Court of Appeals then affirmed the trial court's judgment, the trial court could not reassert the trial court's jurisdiction and grant a new trial to the defendant. The fact that the case made its way through the appeal processes of the Court of Appeals effectively cut off the defendant's right to pursue the defendant's motion for a new trial. Thus, the proper means of placing this issue before the appellate court would be to file a motion for a stay of the direct appeal with the Court of Appeals, and if the stay is denied, then to petition for writ of certiorari. Housing Auth. v. Van Geeter, 252 Ga. 196, 312 S.E.2d 309 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Upon affirmance of trial court's final judgment, rights involved are conclusively adjudicated.</b> - When final judgment of trial court is affirmed by Supreme Court, and not remanded to trial court for further proceedings, controversy is at an end; rights of parties, so far as those rights are involved in litigation, are conclusively adjudicated. Pearle Optical of Monroeville, Inc. v. Georgia State Bd. of Exmrs. in Optometry, 219 Ga. 856, 136 S.E.2d 371 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Affirmance without remand gives judgment full effect.</b> - When final judgment of trial court is affirmed on appeal, and not remanded to trial court, further proceedings on case in appellate court and in trial court are precluded and judgment of lower court is in full force and effect, precisely the same as if no appeal had been taken. Pearle Optical of Monroeville, Inc. v. Georgia State Bd. of Exmrs. in Optometry, 219 Ga. 856, 136 S.E.2d 371 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>After affirmance of final decree trial court cannot entertain ex parte motions to alter decree.</b> - Affirmance of final decree of trial court by Supreme Court without condition or direction leaves trial court on return of remittitur without jurisdiction to entertain or pass upon ex parte motion to add to or amend decree. Pearle Optical of Monroeville, Inc. v. Georgia State Bd. of Exmrs. in Optometry, 219 Ga. 856, 136 S.E.2d 371 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Reversal without direction</b> results in vacation of judgment and trial de novo. Worley v. Travelers Indem. Co., 121 Ga. App. 179, 173 S.E.2d 248 (1970). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment of reversal, without more, operates only to vacate orders and decree as therein stated, and to reinvest trial court with jurisdiction, on filing of remittitur in office of clerk of trial court. It neither serves as a substitute for findings for appellant, nor enlarges powers of trial judge in reference thereto. Holton v. Lankford, 189 Ga. 506, 6 S.E.2d 304 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of reversal by Supreme Court</b> is to place case where it stood prior thereto; and thereafter the trial court should enter order sustaining exceptions of law, and a finding sustaining exceptions of fact when jury trial is not demanded. Holton v. Lankford, 189 Ga. 506, 6 S.E.2d 304 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing of remittitur merely annuls and vacates orders which have been reversed,</b> leaving examiner's report standing as before, and restoring exceptions to their original status - neither sustained nor overruled, but ripe for disposition according to law. Holton v. Lankford, 189 Ga. 506, 6 S.E.2d 304 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lower court's entry of judgment on remittitur reversing denial of dispositive motion.</b> - If appellate court has reversed lower court's denial of motion dispositive of case - such as motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment - entry by lower court of judgment on remittitur constitutes final judgment and terminates case, whereas generally in all other situations case continues in lower court until final judgment. Giordano v. Stubbs, 356 F. Supp. 1041 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 483 F.2d 1395 (5th Cir. 1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the lower court has entered a judgment on remittitur reversing the denial of a dispositive motion, the judgment on remittitur is dispositive and the losing party cannot amend or dismiss. Giordano v. Stubbs, 356 F. Supp. 1041 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 483 F.2d 1395 (5th Cir. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment on remittitur reversing decree not dispositive of case.</b> - When the appellate court reverses the lower court's decree which was not dispositive of the case, and further findings of fact and conclusions of law are necessary, party which loses on appeal may amend pleadings or dismiss case even after entry by lower court of judgment on remittitur. Giordano v. Stubbs, 356 F. Supp. 1041 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 483 F.2d 1395 (5th Cir. 1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the appellate court reverses lower court's denial of motion dispositive of case and transmits remittitur back to lower court, before entry by lower court of judgment on remittitur party that lost on appeal can amend that party's pleadings, or can even dismiss the case entirely. Giordano v. Stubbs, 356 F. Supp. 1041 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 483 F.2d 1395 (5th Cir. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of reversal of trial court's sustaining of motion to vacate judgment.</b> - When trial court, after hearing motion to set aside prior order in pending case vacates judgment complained of, and on appeal trial court's decision is reversed without direction, judgment of appellate court is final. Upon remittitur from appellate court being filed in trial court, issue is res judicata, and lower court has no authority to allow movant to amend the movant's motion. Nor can the lower court hear further evidence or consider any other matter that would otherwise affect the finality of the judgment of the Supreme Court. Shepherd v.

<p class="p4"><b>Habeas petition improperly granted.</b> - Writ of habeas corpus granted to a prisoner was reversed because the prisoner had presented the same issues raised in a habeas petition to the trial court and relief had been denied, and the prisoner's appeal of that decision was rejected by the appellate courts; the prisoner's claim was procedurally barred.

<p class="p4"><b>Habeas petition was untimely.</b> - Because a state prisoner did not appeal a conviction to the state supreme court, the conviction became final ten days after the appellate court affirmed the conviction, and the prisoner was not entitled to seek certiorari review to the U.S. Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1257(a).

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of appellate practice rules.</b> - Appellate practice rules were adopted by the General Assembly for the primary purpose of securing speedy and uniform justice in a uniform and well ordered manner; the rules were not adopted to set traps and pitfalls, by way of technicalities, for unwary litigants. Chambliss v. Hall, 113 Ga. App. 96, 147 S.E.2d 334 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liberal construction.</b> - Pleadings and procedure shall be liberally construed so as to bring about a decision on the merits. Grantham v. State, 244 Ga. 775, 262 S.E.2d 777 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the plaintiff failed to file enumerations of error as a separate document, but did set forth enumerations of error in the plaintiff's brief, it was apparent from the notice of appeal, the brief, the enumerations of error in that brief, and the record, exactly what judgment was appealed from and what errors were asserted, and a liberal construction of the appellate practice act required the court to exercise the court's discretion to reach the merits of the case. Leslie v. Williams, 235 Ga. App. 657, 510 S.E.2d 130 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the plaintiffs presented an enumeration of error in the plaintiff's appellate brief and it was apparent from that brief, the notice of appeal and the record what judgment was being appealed from and what error was being asserted, the appellate court considered the merits of the appeal to the extent the appeal was supported by argument, citation to the record, and authority. Reeder v. GMAC, 235 Ga. App. 617, 510 S.E.2d 337 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although plaintiff's delay in following up on the transmission of the record was unreasonable and inexcusable, the language of this section and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-30 and 5-6-48 mandated that the appellate practice provisions be liberally construed. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to dismiss when the plaintiffs had filed affidavits of indigency. Carter v. Fulton-DeKalb County Hosp. Auth., 209 Ga. App. 384, 433 S.E.2d 433 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Notice of appeal containing the petitioner's name, indicating the opposing party, specifying the case number and that the appeal involved an adverse ruling in petitioner's habeas corpus action satisfied the requirements of the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30 et seq., and, in conjunction with the timely application for a certificate of probable cause, was sufficient to confer jurisdiction over the case upon the Supreme Court. Hughes v. Sikes, 273 Ga. 804, 546 S.E.2d 518 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Despite the deficiencies in the appellant's brief, which made it difficult for the court of appeals to determine what the case was even about, much less allow the court to perform any meaningful analysis of the asserted errors, given that the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30 et seq., was to be liberally construed so as to bring about a decision on the merits of every case appealed and to avoid dismissal of any case, the appeals court declined to dismiss the appeal, opting instead to exercise the court's discretion to consider the case's merits. Parekh v. Wimpy, 288 Ga. App. 125, 653 S.E.2d 352 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0520, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 319 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Georgia appellate court is bound by the statutory mandate that the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30 et seq., is to be liberally construed so as to bring about a decision on the merits of every case appealed and to avoid dismissal of any case or refusal to consider any points raised therein. Larose v. Bank of Am., N.A., 321 Ga. App. 465, 740 S.E.2d 882 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the state failed to file, or include in the state's brief as Part 2, an enumeration of errors as required by Ga. Ct. App. R. 25(a)(2) and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-40, 5-6-48(f) and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30 required the liberal construction of the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30 et seq., so as to avoid dismissal of any case or refuse to consider any points raised therein. Because the court could ascertain the state's argument, it was considered. State v. Freeman, 349 Ga. App. 94, 825 S.E.2d 538 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No application to all appeals.</b> - While O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-14-52(a) provides that appeals in habeas corpus cases shall be governed by the Appellate Practice Act (Act), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30 et seq., that provision only means that appeals in habeas corpus cases, once begun, are to be handled in the same way as other civil appeals, and the Act does not provide for every single act involved in an appeal as there is no provision in the Act for computing time limits, and it is necessary to supplement the provisions of the Act by reference to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-6. Head v. Thomason, 276 Ga. 434, 578 S.E.2d 426, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 957, 124 S. Ct. 409, 157 L. Ed. 2d 294 (2003), overruled on other grounds by State v. Lane, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 98 (Ga. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Clarification for cross-appeals.</b> - Appellate court erred by dismissing the cross-appeals of the defendants because a cross-appeal that is filed in a timely and otherwise procedurally proper manner need not be factually related to the issues raised in the main appeal; rather, as O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(a) states, the cross-appeal may involve all errors or rulings adversely affecting the appellees. Sewell v. Cancel, 295 Ga. 235, 759 S.E.2d 485 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Georgia Supreme Court clarifies that a cross-appeal that is filed in a timely and otherwise procedurally proper manner need not be factually related to the issues raised in the main appeal; rather, the cross-appeal may involve all errors or rulings adversely affecting the appellee and, to the extent Fulton v. Pilon, 199 Ga. App. 861, 406 S.E.2d 517 (1991), and other cases have required otherwise, those cases are overruled. Sewell v. Cancel, 295 Ga. 235, 759 S.E.2d 485 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of Appeals should pass upon all questions of law not requiring consideration of evidence.</b> Irby v. Christian, 130 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Code citation.</b> - In raising constitutional issue, one need not cite to official Code, rather than Code Annotated. Grantham v. State, 244 Ga. 775, 262 S.E.2d 777 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment overruling motion for new trial based upon appealable judgment.</b> - Using a liberal construction as required by this section, it would be incongruous to declare unappealable a judgment overruling a motion for new trial which is based upon an admittedly appealable judgment. Munday v. Brissette, 113 Ga. App. 147, 148 S.E.2d 55, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 162, 149 S.E.2d 110 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Appellee" construed.</b> - Interpretation of the word appellee, as used in Ga. L. 1968, p. 1072, <span class="s1">§</span> 7 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38), to mean only the party against whom appeal is taken and who has a particular interest adverse to setting aside judgment appealed is too restrictive because a liberal construction of Ga. L. 1965, p. 18, <span class="s1">§</span> 23 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30) comports with policies of the law, enhances efficient administration of justice, and avoids multiplicity of appeals. Executive Jet Sales, Inc. v. Jet America, Inc., 242 Ga. 307, 248 S.E.2d 676 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Proceedings in lower court" construed.</b> - To define "proceedings in lower court," as used in Ga. L. 1973, p. 303, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-37) to mean only those proceedings which directly relate to the appellant's enumerations of error is unduly restrictive because liberal construction comports with the policies of the law, enhances the efficient administration of justice, and avoids a multiplicity of appeals. Executive Jet Sales, Inc. v. Jet America, Inc., 242 Ga. 307, 248 S.E.2d 676 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal improper under </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 5-6-39 when appellant does not cause delay and judge denies extension.</b> - To construe Ga. L. 1965, p. 18, <span class="s1">§</span> 6 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-39) as requiring dismissal when the appellant does not cause delay and trial judge declines to grant requested extension would shut off the right of appeal, and would thus violate Ga. Const. 1976, Art. VI, Sec. II, Para. V (see Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. IX, Para. II), and would be contrary to the legislative intent expressed in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal when first-impression issue decided on merits.</b> - Because important first-impression issue was raised under recently enacted and previously unconstrued public revenue statute, and because the trial court dealt with that issue on the merits, the appellate court chose to pretermit procedural issue and decide the appeal on the merits. In re Board of Twiggs County Comm'rs, 249 Ga. 642, 292 S.E.2d 673 (1982), overruled on other grounds by Duke v. State, 829 S.E.2d 348, 2019 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Delay in filing amendment to notice of appeal.</b> - Although it has been over two months later, after the expiration of the statutory appeal period, that the appellant filed an amendment to the appellant's original notice of appeal to correct the error the appellant made, in light of O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-30 and 5-6-48, appellant is entitled to amend the appellant's notice of appeal to correct the name of the court to which the appeal is directed.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to comply with requirements for appellate brief.</b> - Mother's appellate brief failed to provide the required content because there was no statement of the proceedings below, no statement of facts, and not one specific reference to the record or transcript; there was not any appreciable enumerated errors, and no argument or substantive legal analysis; there was no cognizant support for the mother's claim that the trial court erred in granting the father's petition for modification of custody and child support; and, in the absence of a transcript, there was sufficient competent evidence to support the trial court's findings.

<p class="p4">In an attorney lien case, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by dismissing the former client's appeal for a delay in transmitting the record appendix because the delay of 55 days was inexcusable and caused by the former client, who had elected to take responsibility for transmitting the record by stating in the notice of appeal that the client would file a record appendix and never amended the client's notice of appeal to provide that the clerk would be responsible for transmission of the record.

<p class="p4"><b>Directed verdict is reduced to writing by virtue of recitation in verdict signed by judge.</b> - Although directed verdict is normally issued ore tenus, it becomes reduced to writing by virtue of its recitation in the verdict which is signed by the judge and therefore is reviewable as a final judgment. Crowe v. Holloway Dev. Corp., 114 Ga. App. 856, 152 S.E.2d 913 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Entry of oral order.</b> - Oral order is not final nor appealable until and unless the order is reduced to writing, signed by the judge, and filed with the clerk. This constitutes "entry;" and it is only an "entered" decision or judgment which is appealable. Sharp v. State, 183 Ga. App. 641, 360 S.E.2d 50 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The General Assembly further finds that supporting Georgia's children is vitally important to the citizens of Georgia. Therefore, the General Assembly has determined that it is in the best interests of the state and its citizenry to undertake an evaluation of the child support guidelines on a continuing basis. The General Assembly declares that it is important that all of Georgia's children are provided with adequate financial support whether the children's parents are living together or not living together. The General Assembly finds that both parents have a continuing obligation with respect to providing financial and emotional stability for their child or children.

<p class="p4">Ga. L. 2006, p. 379, <span class="s1">§</span> 1/HB 1059, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The General Assembly finds and declares that recidivist sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Many sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and some sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The General Assembly finds that this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. The General Assembly further finds that the high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(1) Incarcerating sexual offenders and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(2) Requiring the registration of sexual offenders, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(3) Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual offenders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(4) Collecting data relative to sexual offenses and sexual offenders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(5) Requiring sexual predators who are released into the community to wear an electronic monitoring system for the rest of their natural life and to pay for such system; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(6) Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"The General Assembly further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual offenders and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual offenders to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual offenders. The General Assembly declares that in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual offenders be registered and that members of the community and the public be notified of a sexual offender's presence. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes. Likewise, the designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from findings by the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board and a court if requested by a sexual offender." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to comply with interlocutory appeal procedures.</b> - Trial court's denial of a wife's motion to vacate was affirmed because the husband's filing of a notice of appeal without first complying with the requirements for obtaining interlocutory review had no legal effect and, therefore, did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the husband's motion for reconsideration or from entering a modification order.

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of interlocutory appeal does not prevent eventual review.</b> - Denial of interlocutory appeal by statute does not prevent a litigant from eventually seeking review in an appellate court of a judgment granting a new trial; this is so because upon conclusion of the case in the trial court and entry of final judgment, an appeal can then be taken from the final judgment, and in such appeal legality of judgment granting new trial can be attached.

<p class="p4"><b>State could not appeal order granting new trial.</b> - State's appeal of an order granting the defendant's motion for new trial was dismissed because the state could not appeal the order granting the new trial under the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(d); no appeal was taken here under subsections (a), (b), or (c) of <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34.

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment overruling motion for new trial based on appealable judgment is appealable.</b> - Using liberal construction as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30, it would be incongruous to declare unappealable a judgment overruling motion for new trial which is based upon an admittedly appealable judgment. Munday v. Brissette, 113 Ga. App. 147, 148 S.E.2d 55, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 162, 149 S.E.2d 110 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Denied motion final although rendered before judgment entered on verdict.</b> - Order denying motion for new trial from general verdict is final and appealable, even though no judgment has been entered on verdict.

<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction over direct appeal of case involving injunctive relief not otherwise an "equity" case.</b> - When a case involved the grant or denial of an injunction as an ancillary matter, the Supreme Court's transfer of an interlocutory appeal application to the Court of Appeals was a binding determination that the case was not an "equity" case in the Supreme Court's general jurisdiction and the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over direct appeal of the case; overruling Auto Cash.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by dissolving a temporary restraining order and allowing a bank to proceed with the bank's foreclosure action as it was within the trial court's discretion to condition the extension of injunctive relief upon the mortgagor's placement of an amount of money in escrow reflecting past-due payments on the mortgage, which the mortgagor declined to do.

<p class="p4"><b>Reversal required where court abused court's discretion by not balancing equities.</b> - Because an order granting the interlocutory injunction did not reflect that the trial court balanced the relative equities of the parties, which the party seeking the relief would have had to demonstrate entitlement to, the order had to be reversed, as the trial court abused the court's discretion.

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - Clear purpose of O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35 is to permit the appellate courts to review expeditiously decisions of the superior courts reviewing decisions of administrative agencies without issuing an opinion in every such case.

<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35 was enacted to ameliorate the appellate courts' massive case loads. Scruggs v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 261 Ga. 587, 408 S.E.2d 103 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with other law.</b> - In an action on a credit card contract brought by a creditor, the debtor's voluntary dismissal of an appeal from an order granting the creditor summary judgment before the case was ever docketed served to dismiss the debtor's direct appeal, even though the trial court did not enter a formal dismissal order; thus, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, and a payment of appeal costs became moot. Ghee v. Target Nat'l Bank, 282 Ga. App. 28, 637 S.E.2d 742 (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 62 (Ga. 2007), 552 U.S. 859, 128 S. Ct. 141, 169 L.

<p class="p4">Discretionary application requirement of Georgia Prison Litigation Reform Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-12-8, was inapplicable to an injured party's renewed personal injury suit because the injured party was not a prisoner when the de novo action was filed.

<p class="p4">Because a city could have challenged an agency consent order under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 12-2-2(c) and 50-13-19, but did not, the city's appeal of a judgment to enforce the consent order did not fall under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35(a)(1), but arose from proceedings under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-5-189; since the city did not appeal the director's decision, the appellate issue was limited to the propriety of the judgment and not the correctness of the decision.

<p class="p4">Property owners were allowed to file a direct appeal of the dismissal of the owners' two latest lawsuits challenging zoning decisions related to a proposed private school near or contiguous to their property; the property owners' appeal was not one from the decision of a court reviewing the decision of an administrative agency within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35(a)(1), and, thus, the owners were not required to file an application for a discretionary appeal.

<p class="p4">Although a former employer failed to properly serve papers, including a summary judgment motion, on the former employee's counsel at the counsel's new address, despite a change of address having been provided, pursuant to Ga. Ct. App. R. 1(a) and Ga. Ct. App. R. 6, the appellate court denied the employee's motion to dismiss the appeal and, instead, the court reviewed the matter on the merits; the improper service was asserted as a ground for an award of attorney fees, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-14, and such award would be subject to appellate review under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35(a)(10).

<p class="p4">While the failure to move for a directed verdict barred a party from contending on appeal that the party was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law because of insufficient evidence, such did not bar the party from contending their entitlement to a new trial on that ground, as fairness dictated that a party who has failed to move for a directed verdict at trial should not be able to obtain a judgment as a matter of law on appeal based on the contention the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.

<p class="p4"><b>Clear intent of paragraph (a)(1)</b> is to give appellate courts (particularly Court of Appeals which has jurisdiction of workers' compensation cases not involving constitutionality of a law) discretion not to entertain an appeal when the superior court has reviewed a decision of certain specified lower tribunals (i.e., two tribunals had already adjudicated the case).

<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - Legislature required the discretionary appeals procedures for appeals from orders or judgments denying relief in cases seeking to set aside judgments.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of paragraph (a)(8) classification.</b> - Classification created by paragraph (a)(8) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35 is reasonable and does not deny equal protection on the ground that while a party desiring to appeal an order denying a complaint in equity must file an application to appeal, a party desiring to appeal from an order granting a complaint in equity is entitled to a direct appeal. Schiesser v. Ross, 256 Ga. 414, 349 S.E.2d 745 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Construed with O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 5-6-34(b).</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35 does not allow a party to ignore the interlocutory-application provision of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(b), when attempting to obtain appellate review. Scruggs v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 261 Ga. 587, 408 S.E.2d 103 (1991); Collier v. Evans, 205 Ga. App. 764, 423 S.E.2d 704 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Party seeking appellate review from an interlocutory order must follow the interlocutory-application i subsection, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(b), seek a certificate of immediate review from the trial court, and comply with the time limitations therein. Scruggs v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 261 Ga. 587, 408 S.E.2d 103 (1991); Collier v. Evans, 205 Ga. App. 764, 423 S.E.2d 704 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Martin v. Williams, 263 Ga. 707, 438 S.E.2d 353 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Underlying subject matter generally controls over the relief sought in determining the proper procedure to follow to appeal; thus, when a trial court issues a judgment listed in the direct appeal statute in a case whose subject matter is covered under the discretionary appeal statute, the discretionary application procedure must be followed when the party is appealing a judgment or order that is procedurally subject to a direct appeal. Rebich v. Miles, 264 Ga. 467, 448 S.E.2d 192 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In plaintiff's appeal of the denial of the plaintiff's request for a declaratory judgment, the plaintiff could add issues relating to other rulings which might affect the proceedings below without regard to whether the proceedings were appealable standing alone.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of 1986 amendment of </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>40-13-28. - The 1986 amendment to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 40-13-28 that changed the scope of review in the superior court from a de novo investigation to a review of the record was not also intended to change the method of appeal from the superior court in such cases from discretionary appeals under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35(a)(1) to direct appeals under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(a).

<p class="p4"><b>Two-step appellate review process:</b> (1) initial appellate review of a record which will include copies of such parts of the trial court record or transcript as the appellant or appellee deem appropriate; (2) if the initial appellate review reveals that the appellant's enumerations of error are clearly without merit then the application for appeal is dismissed; if however the initial appellate review reveals that the appellant's enumerations of error are not clearly without merit, then the application for appeal is granted and a final appellate review ensues.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Required contents of application.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35 requires a party to state if the order or judgment is interlocutory, and if it is interlocutory, the party must state "the need for interlocutory appellate review." Scruggs v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 261 Ga. 587, 408 S.E.2d 103 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Petition for discretionary appeal must adequately demonstrate reversible error.</b> - Although paragraph (c) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35 does not require an applicant for discretionary appeal to include relevant portions of the record or transcript as exhibits to the petition, a prudent applicant should support the assertions of error with relevant parts of the record or transcript so as to adequately demonstrate reversible error, unless the alleged errors are otherwise established as, for instance, by the agreement of the parties on appeal or by a quote or paraphrase from the record or transcript. Harper v. Harper, 259 Ga. 246, 378 S.E.2d 673 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court judgment finding against the appellant's counterclaim and refusing amendment of the counterclaim was affirmed because the ruling to which the appellant objected was not contained in the record before the appellate court; thus, there was nothing for the court to review and the appellate court must presume the correctness of the ruling by the trial court. Moore v. Childs, 347 Ga. App. 560, 820 S.E.2d 186 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of grant of discretionary appeal.</b> - When the court of appeals granted a discretionary appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35, the trial court was without authority to find such appeal to be frivolous and the denial of supersedeas bond on that ground was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law and fact. Farmer v. State, 216 Ga. App. 515, 455 S.E.2d 297 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Amount in controversy.</b> - No application for discretionary review by the Court of Appeals need be made pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35 when the amount placed in controversy exceeds $2,500 (now $10,000.00). Todd v. City of Brunswick, 175 Ga. App. 562, 334 S.E.2d 1 (1985), aff'd, 255 Ga. 448, 339 S.E.2d 589 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">For establishing jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35, a judgment is comprised of principal, plus costs, plus interest at the legal rate accrued from the date of the filing of the judgment until the date of the filing of the notice of appeal; appeals involving nonmonetary judgments in child custody cases.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standing.</b> - Full board of the state board of workers' compensation neither granted the plaintiff's petition for a change of benefits nor authorized action which is adverse to the defendant; therefore, since the defendant was not aggrieved by the full board's award, the defendant had no standing to appeal to the superior court from the full board's award.

<p class="p4">When an application for discretionary review was not filed, and a subsequent notice of direct appeal was filed untimely, there was no jurisdiction conferred on the court to hear the appeal. Boney v. State, 236 Ga. App. 179, 510 S.E.2d 892 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filing before granting of application is timely.</b> - While a failure to file a notice of appeal within ten days after the grant of an application will subject an appellant to dismissal, the filing of a notice of appeal after the judgment complained of is entered but before the granting of the application to appeal does not constitute a failure to timely file. Wannamaker v. Carr, 257 Ga. 634, 362 S.E.2d 53 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the plaintiff had filed the plaintiff's initial application for discretionary review nearly four months before the trial court's order denying the plaintiff's motion for a new trial, the order was void and a nullity, and provided no jurisdictional basis for an appeal. Department of Human Resources v. Holland, 236 Ga. App. 273, 511 S.E.2d 628 (1999), overruled on other grounds, Cooper v. Spotts, 309 Ga. App. 361, 710 S.E.2d 159 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the order granting a defense motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiff's motion to withdraw admissions was subject to direct appeal and the plaintiff had initiated the plaintiff's appeal by filing an otherwise timely discretionary application, the appellate court granted the application; furthermore, because the order granting the application was issued on August 1, 2017, and directed the plaintiff to file a notice of appeal within 10 days, but the plaintiff had already filed a notice of appeal on July 13, 2017, the plaintiff's amended notice of appeal was unnecessary as the prematurely filed July 13 notice ripened into a timely notice of appeal upon the appellate court's granting of the discretionary application.

It was not intended in Bales to require the dismissal of an appeal of a judgment that exceeds $2,500 (now $10,000), prior to set-offs from a collateral source, on the ground that, at the time the notice of appeal was filed, an appeal application was required under Barikos.

<p class="p4"><b>Because the main case was before the Court of Appeals of Georgia, Third Division on direct appeal,</b> under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35(j) the court granted an attorney's application for discretionary appeal of the denial by the trial court of the attorney's motion for attorney fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-14(a) and (b).

<p class="p4"><b>Challenge to zoning ordinance change not subject to discretionary appeal.</b> - Landfill company's direct appeal was properly before the appellate court because the case was not a zoning case that required an application for discretionary appeal as it was challenging a change in the ordinance overall, which was an exercise of legislative power and not an adjudicative decision of an administrative agency, as opposed to appealing a land use decision specific to it.

<p class="p4"><b>Motion to set aside considered in context of all circumstances.</b> - Petitioner's case was remanded to the habeas court for it to consider the motion to set aside in a manner that takes into account the affidavit of habeas counsel in the context of all the circumstances of the case because the habeas court did not make a finding as to whether habeas counsel received notice of the final habeas hearing based on a consideration of the affidavit of habeas counsel, thus, the habeas court's analysis was incomplete.

<p class="p4"><b>Habeas petition improperly granted.</b> - Writ of habeas corpus granted to a prisoner was reversed because the prisoner presented the same issues raised in the habeas petition to the trial court and relief had been denied, and the prisoner's appeal of that decision was rejected by the appellate courts; thus, the prisoner's claim was procedurally barred.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A motion for new trial need not be filed as a condition precedent to appeal or consideration of any judgment, ruling, or order in any case; but, in all cases where a motion for new trial is an available remedy, the party entitled thereto may elect to file the motion first or to appeal directly. However, where matters complained of arise or are discovered subsequent to verdict or judgment which otherwise would not appear in the record, such as newly discovered evidence, and in other like instances, a motion for new trial or other available procedure shall be filed and together with all proceedings thereon shall become a part of the record on appeal. Otherwise, the motion for new trial need not be transmitted as a part of the record on appeal; nor shall it be necessary that the overruling thereof be enumerated as error (subject to the exception last stated), as the appellate court may consider all questions included in the enumeration of errors provided for in Code Section 5-6-40. The entry of judgment on a verdict by the trial court constitutes an adjudication by the trial court as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, affording a basis for review on appeal without further ruling by the trial court. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>9-11-50. - While the failure to move for a directed verdict barred a party from contending on appeal that the party was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law because of insufficient evidence, such did not bar that party from claiming their entitlement to a new trial on that ground, as fairness dictated that a party who has failed to move for a directed verdict at trial should not be able to obtain a judgment as a matter of law on appeal based on the contention the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Aldworth Co. v. England, 281 Ga. 197, 637 S.E.2d 198 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Subsection (a) gives litigant option to appeal directly, or first move for new trial.</b> - Subsection (a) clearly gives a litigant the right to appeal directly from an adverse verdict and judgment, or to defer appeal until a ruling is obtained on a motion for new trial. Brissette v. Munday, 115 Ga. App. 131, 153 S.E.2d 606 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of filing of motion for new trial</b> is to toll time for filing appeal from judgment on the verdict until the motion for new trial is overruled (unless the appellant should elect to abandon or dismiss the motion). Allen v. Rome Kraft Co., 114 Ga. App. 717, 152 S.E.2d 618 (1966); A &amp; D Barrel &amp; Drum Co. v. Fuqua, 132 Ga. App. 827, 209 S.E.2d 272 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appeal from ruling on motion for new trial or from original judgment rendered.</b> - Since filing of motion for new trial is not condition precedent to appeal, an appeal may be made directly from any other appealable judgment, ruling, or order, but this does not negate appealability of ruling on motion for new trial when that procedure is utilized and it is desired to appeal from such ruling. The result is practically identical moreover, since the same grounds of appeal may be urged whichever judgment is appealed from and the appellants are not limited to grounds of motion for new trial in any appeal. Munday v. Brissette, 113 Ga. App. 147, 148 S.E.2d 55, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 162, 149 S.E.2d 110 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adverse ruling on motion for judgment n.o.v. must be enumerated as error on appeal.</b> - Losing party may file motion for judgment n.o.v., or the party may appeal directly from judgment and enumerate as error the denial of a directed verdict. If the losing party files a motion for judgment n.o.v. and obtains a ruling on it judgment, the losing party has used that device as a means of reviewing the motion for directed verdict at trial level. If ruling is adverse the losing party must enumerate it as error on appeal or become bound by the ruling and judgment unexcepted to, which becomes the law of the case. Wood v. Mobley, 114 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>To set aside judgment predicated upon jury verdict requires direct appeal or new trial.</b> - When judgment is predicated upon jury verdict, the court has no plenary right to vacate, revise, or otherwise treat.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to renew motion for directed verdict.</b> - Challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence may be considered on appeal pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-36(a); even though an owner and a driver failed to renew their motions for a directed verdict on the issues of agency and lost earnings at the close of all evidence, the appellate court considered the merits of the evidentiary challenges.

<p class="p4"><b>Excessiveness of verdict.</b> - Appellate court declined to set aside the amount of the verdict for pain and suffering and wrongful death when a juvenile in a child care institution was accidentally electrocuted because $1,000,000 for pain and suffering and $2,000,000 for wrongful death were not excessive as a matter of law. Ga. Dep't of Human Res. v. Johnson, 264 Ga. App. 730, 592 S.E.2d 124 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of evidence, not its weight, is reviewed.</b> - Weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are questions for the triers of fact. The Court of Appeals passes on the sufficiency of the evidence, not the weight of the evidence, which is considered by the jury. Mosley v. State, 157 Ga. App. 578, 278 S.E.2d 154 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Role of an appellate court is not to pass on the weight of the evidence but the sufficiency. If there is any evidence to support the verdict of the trial court the appellate court cannot disturb the verdict. Gay v. City of Rome, 157 Ga. App. 368, 277 S.E.2d 741 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the trier of fact can and must weigh and analyze the evidence, an appellate court, in reviewing on the general grounds, is restricted to determining if there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment of conviction. After conviction, the evidence in the record is reviewed on appeal in the light most favorable to the state. Gibbs v. State, 157 Ga.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">Unless otherwise provided by law, an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals by filing with the clerk of the court wherein the case was determined a notice of appeal. The notice shall set forth the title and docket number of the case; the name of the appellant and the name and address of his attorney; a concise statement of the judgment, ruling, or order entitling the appellant to take an appeal; the court appealed to; a designation of those portions of the record to be omitted from the record on appeal; a concise statement as to why the appellate court appealed to has jurisdiction rather than the other appellate court; and, if the appeal is from a judgment of conviction in a criminal case, a brief statement of the offense and the punishment prescribed. The appeal shall not be dismissed nor denied consideration because of failure to include the jurisdictional statement or because of a designation of the wrong appellate court. In addition, the notice shall state whether or not any transcript of evidence and proceedings is to be transmitted as a part of the record on appeal. Approval by the court is not required as a condition to filing the notice. All parties to the proceedings in the lower court shall be parties on appeal and shall be served with a copy of the notice of appeal in the manner prescribed by Code Section 5-6-32.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Proceedings in lower court" as used in section should be liberally construed.</b> - To define "proceedings in lower court," as used in this section to mean only those proceedings which directly relate to the appellant's enumerations of error is unduly restrictive because liberal construction comports with policies of this article, enhances efficient administration of justice, and avoids multiplicity of appeals. Executive Jet Sales, Inc. v. Jet America, Inc., 242 Ga. 307, 248 S.E.2d 676 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Verdict is not an appealable decision or judgment within purview of section.</b> Williams v. Keebler, 222 Ga. 437, 150 S.E.2d 674, answer conformed to, 114 Ga. App. 332, 151 S.E.2d 483 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment of forfeiture.</b> - Because an appealed judgment was a forfeiture, the court of appeals addressed the merits of the appeal. Arreola-Soto v. State of Ga., 314 Ga. App. 165, 723 S.E.2d 482 (2012), cert. denied, No. S12C1048, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 593 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant responsible for contents of record.</b> - It is appellant's burden to designate what shall be included in the record on appeal; failing which the Court of Appeals is not authorized to go outside the record and accept assertions of fact in briefs which are not supported by the record, nor accept as fact what is asserted by way of argument in a transcript. Doe v. State, 205 Ga. App. 322, 422 S.E.2d 558 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Burden is on the appellant to direct transmittal of the trial transcript and, lacking a transcript of the evidence, the court of appeals must assume that the proceedings, the jury's verdict, and the judgment entered upon that verdict, were correct. Durham v. Winn-Dixie Stores, 215 Ga. App. 209, 450 S.E.2d 257 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exclusions from record not permitted.</b> - While the statutory scheme under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-43(a) contemplates requests by the appellee to include portions of the record that the appellant has designated for exclusion, the statute does not authorize the appellee to request exclusion of items the appellant desires to include. McHugh Fuller Law Group, PLLC v. PruittHealth-Toccoa, LLC, 297 Ga. 94, 772 S.E.2d 660 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in ordering the trial court clerk to omit from the appellate record all submissions filed after entry of the permanent injunction because the statutory scheme presumes that a complete record will be transmitted to the appellate court unless the appellant specifically requests otherwise. McHugh Fuller Law Group, PLLC v. PruittHealth-Toccoa, LLC, 297 Ga. 94, 772 S.E.2d 660 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to review jury verdicts.</b> - When there is only an appeal from a jury verdict, and no description of an appealable judgment or order, there is nothing to review, and the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction since the appellate court is a court for corrections of errors of law alone. Interstate Fire Ins. Co. v. Chattam, 222 Ga. 436, 150 S.E.2d 618, answer conformed to, 114 Ga. App. 332, 151 S.E.2d 486 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court is not deprived of jurisdiction because appellant fails to serve notice of appeal</b> on appellee as required. Bull v. Bull, 243 Ga. 72, 252 S.E.2d 494 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When third-party defendant not harmed by failure of service.</b> - Appeal shall not be dismissed when counsel for a third-party defendant appeared in court and argued the merits of the third party's claim both orally and by brief, it appears that the third-party defendant was not harmed by failure of service, and there is no ground to dismiss the appeal. Petroleum Carrier Corp. v. Jones, 127 Ga. App. 676, 194 S.E.2d 670 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transmittal of portion of record.</b> - Appellant may choose to have only a portion of a record transmitted to the Court of Appeals, but this does not relieve the appellant from the obligation to demonstrate error by the record. Jordan v. Johnson, 223 Ga. App. 875, 479 S.E.2d 175 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant for failure to timely file a transcript for inclusion in the record on appeal because the appellant's failure to file a transcript could not be deemed to have caused an unreasonable delay as the appellant's notice of appeal did not designate a transcript for inclusion in the appellate record, and the choice of whether to include a transcript in the appellate record was left to the appellant; thus, the trial court abused the court's discretion in dismissing the appellant's notice of appeal. Hill v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. System of Ga., 346 Ga. App. 830, 816 S.E.2d 296 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delay in filing of transcript is not necessarily cause for dismissal.</b> - Delay in filing of transcript, if it does not delay docketing and hearing of case in appellate court, is not cause for dismissal. AMOCO v. McCluskey, 116 Ga. App. 706, 158 S.E.2d 431 (1967), rev'd on other grounds, 224 Ga. 253, 161 S.E.2d 271 (1968). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because there was no evidence that an 11-day delay in the filing of a transcript for transmission as part of the appellate record discernibly delayed the docketing of the record in the appellate court, the trial court abused the court's discretion by concluding that the delay was unreasonable, and erred by dismissing an appeal. Fulton County Bd. of Tax Assessors v. Love, 289 Ga. App. 252, 656 S.E.2d 576 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delay caused by clerk of court.</b> - The Constitution forbids dismissal of any case when delay is attributable to clerk of court rather than to counsel. AMOCO v. McCluskey, 116 Ga. App. 706, 158 S.E.2d 431 (1967), rev'd on other grounds, 224 Ga. 253, 161 S.E.2d 271 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Erroneous filing with Supreme Court.</b> - Application for discretionary appeal erroneously filed with the Supreme Court was not required to be dismissed as untimely, but could be transferred to the Court of Appeals. Smith v. Department of Human Resources, 226 Ga. App. 491, 487 S.E.2d 94 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Supersedeas not enforceable.</b> - Issue of whether judgment debtor received adequate notice of the sheriff's sale was not preserved for the appellate court's review, as the judgment debtor did not seek to set aside the supersedeas bond order or the sheriff's sale. Wilson v. 72 Riverside Invs., LLC, 277 Ga. App. 312, 626 S.E.2d 521 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Burden is upon party desiring to take appeal to file timely notice of appeal.</b> - Burden is on party desiring to take appeal to determine when judgment is filed in trial court, and to file notice of appeal within the 30-day period or within duly authorized extension of the 30-day period. Jordan v. Caldwell, 229 Ga. 343, 191 S.E.2d 530 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a litigant's appeal was untimely filed, despite evidence of mistaken delivery beyond the litigant's control, the superior court properly held that the court lacked discretion to find otherwise as the burden to timely file an appeal could not be relieved by providential cause and excusable neglect; thus, the court did not err in dismissing the appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Motion for out-of-time appeal properly denied.</b> - Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal, as such failed to show any meritorious ground, and the defendant's failure to timely file an appeal did not result from the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, as it was apparent from the transcript of the plea hearing that the issues sought to be raised in the out-of-time appeal completely lacked merit.

<p class="p4"><b>Notice of appeal must specify appealable judgment</b> from which appeal is entered, absent which appeal must be dismissed. Parish v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 115 Ga. App. 540, 154 S.E.2d 750 (1967); Ballew v. State, 225 Ga. 547, 170 S.E.2d 242 (1969); Bish v. State, 232 Ga. App. 121, 501 S.E.2d 283 (1998); Zachery v. State, 233 Ga.

<p class="p4">It is the duty of the appellate courts to inquire into the court's own jurisdiction and dismiss the appeal when an appealable judgment or order is not included in the notice of appeal. Interstate Fire Ins. Co. v. Chattam, 222 Ga. 436, 150 S.E.2d 618, answer conformed to, 114 Ga. App. 332, 151 S.E.2d 486 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fact that appealable judgment is shown to exist, or that antecedent interlocutory ruling on motion would be reviewable when enumerated as error on proper designation of appealable judgment, does not cure fatal defect in notice of appeal arising from failure to appeal from such judgment. Ruth v. Kennedy, 117 Ga. App. 632, 161 S.E.2d 410 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere mention of judgment overruling motion to set aside verdict and judgment.</b> - Mere mention in a notice of appeal of a judgment overruling a motion to set aside verdict and judgment does not constitute appeal from the final judgment so as to satisfy the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-37. Omission in notice of appeal to designate any appealable judgment or order as ruling that entitles appellant to take appeal is fatal. Williams v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to state offense and punishment prescribed.</b> - Deficiencies in the defendant's notice of appeal, which did not state the offense and punishment prescribed, did not justify dismissal of the appeal when the notice did provide the specific case number, style, court, and date on which the final judgment appealed from was entered and information contained in the notice, considered in conjunction with even a cursory inspection of the record, would make clear the judgment appealed from, as well as the offense and punishment. Brumby v. State, 264 Ga. 215, 443 S.E.2d 613 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court judgment finding against the appellant's counterclaim and refusing amendment of the counterclaim was affirmed because the ruling to which the appellant objected was not contained in the record before the appellate court; thus, there was nothing for the appellate court to review and the appellate court must presume the correctness of the ruling by the trial court. Moore v. Childs, 347 Ga. App. 560, 820 S.E.2d 186 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statement that appeal is from jury verdict.</b> - When notice of appeal states that the notice is an appeal from a jury verdict, this section does not authorize appellate courts to a cause notice of appeal to be perfected by requiring an appeal to be amended to show an appeal from a judgment or to treat an appeal from verdict as substantial compliance with the statute. Interstate Fire Ins. Co. v. Chattam, 222 Ga. 436, 150 S.E.2d 618, answer conformed to, 114 Ga. App. 332, 151 S.E.2d 486 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice of appeal must specify date of order being appealed to avoid dismissal.</b> - When a notice of appeal does not correctly specify date of order being appealed, appeal must be dismissed as notice of appeal does not set forth a judgment, ruling, or order entitling the appellant to take an appeal within the requirements of section. Hardnett v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 116 Ga. App. 732, 158 S.E.2d 303 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal is proper where there is no judgment of date and description of that appealed from.</b> - When record discloses there is no judgment of the trial court of the date and description of that appealed from, the requirement of this section is not met. The omission is fatal and the appeal must be dismissed. Walker v. Walker, 222 Ga. 521, 150 S.E.2d 635 (1966); Bowers v. Gill, 222 Ga. 529, 150 S.E.2d 653 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When notice of appeal stated that appeal was from verdict and judgment dated February 15, and verdict was correctly dated but judgment was dated February 17, notice did not set forth a judgment, ruling, or order entitling the appellant to take an appeal, nor could there be an appeal from a verdict. Olson v. Austin Enters., Inc., 116 Ga. App. 197, 156 S.E.2d 655 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transcript lacking and notice fails to specify whether it will be transmitted.</b> - When notice of appeal does not specify whether or not the transcript of evidence and proceedings is to be transmitted as part of the record on appeal as required by this section, and the record does not contain such transcript, the judgment of trial court must be affirmed. Beasley v. Lamb, 227 Ga. 266, 180 S.E.2d 240 (1971); Hageman v. State, 205 Ga. App. 644, 423 S.E.2d 56 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellants used ambiguous language in the appellants notice of appeal and did not include the statutory language suggested regarding whether or not a transcript was to be sent to the appellate court because, when the appellants filed the notice of appeal, there was a transcript of an earlier summary judgment hearing that was already on file, but the appellants had not filed a transcript of a second summary judgment hearing relevant to the appeal; and it was not clear from the appellants' notice of appeal whether the trial court clerk was to wait for the second transcript or send the record with only the transcript already on file. Webb's Erection, Inc. v. Colonial Pacific Leasing Corporation, 345 Ga. App. 202, 812 S.E.2d 602 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence missing from notice of appeal.</b> - When some portion of the evidence upon which the superior court relied was omitted from the record on appeal, it is assumed that the judgment below is correct. Bennett v. Executive<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Benefits, Inc., 210 Ga. App. 429, 436 S.E.2d 544 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-37 is designed to allow appellate courts to determine if the record before them contains the same evidence that was before the trial court at the time the trial court ruled. Since the discovery responses of the parties, which were filed before the motion for summary judgment, have been omitted based on the record designation in the notice of appeal and based on the absence of an affidavit and a deposition cited in the summary judgment documents, it is obvious that the party omitted material evidence from the record on appeal, and therefore it must be presumed that the superior court record properly supports the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Moulton v. Wood, 265 Ga. App. 389, 593 S.E.2d 911 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action for damages resulting from excavations on the adjoining landowner's property that impermissibly also removed soil from the landowner's property, the trial court did not err in granting the adjoining landowner's motion for summary judgment because the landowner omitted from the record some portion of the evidence upon which the trial court relied. Brock v. Daugherty, 346 Ga. App. 302, 816 S.E.2d 137 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When transcript of evidence to resolve enumerations of error not forwarded, judgment affirmed.</b> - When the record on appeal contains enumerations of error which can only be resolved by reference to the evidence, and the appellant instructed the clerk to transmit the entire record on appeal and to "omit nothing," but did not order any transcript of evidence to be filed, and, as a result, no transcript was forwarded, the appellate court must affirm the judgment of the trial court. Tempo Carpet Co. v. Collectible Classic Cars of Ga., Inc., 166 Ga. App. 564, 305 S.E.2d 26 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When the notice of appeal did not specify that a transcript of evidence</b> and proceedings was to be transmitted as part of the record on appeal, although a portion of the argument and testimony was attached to the record, the Court of Appeals was required to rely on the presumption in favor of the regularity of all proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, assume that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's summary judgment, and affirm the judgment. Acker v. Jenkins, 178 Ga. App. 393, 343 S.E.2d 160 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit by homeowners for breach of an exclusive listing contract, a statement in the notice of appeal that the "entire record" should be transmitted to the appellate court, was insufficient to ensure the transmittal of a trial transcript and did not meet the burden under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-37 to state whether or not any transcript of evidence and proceedings was to be transmitted as a part of the record on appeal. West v. Austin, 274 Ga. App. 729, 618 S.E.2d 662 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an appeal of a criminal conviction, the appellate court chose to sua sponte reinstate the case to address the appellant's enumerations of error on the merits despite the failure to set forth in the notice of appeal the intention to rely upon a previously transmitted transcript because the court had not yet addressed the issue in a published opinion and used the case to place future appellants on notice that similar procedural errors may result in automatic affirmance of a trial court's decision. Holman v. State, 329 Ga. App. 393, 765 S.E.2d 614 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to include trial court transcript.</b> - In a breach of contract and quantum meruit case, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellee because the appellant failed to comply with the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-37 by providing a trial court transcript, which made the appellate record incomplete and required the trial court judgment to be affirmed. Curry v. Miller, 328 Ga. App. 564, 763 S.E.2d 489 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Whene appellants choose to omit the transcript,</b> and the transcript is necessary for a review of the claimed error, the appellants have failed to meet the appellants' burden of showing error. In such a case, the Court of Appeals will assume the evidence is sufficient and affirm. Hunnicutt v. Hunnicutt, 182 Ga. App. 578, 356 S.E.2d 679 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No abuse in considering untimely transcript of record.</b> - It was not an abuse of discretion for the appellate court to consider a transcript of the record which was filed after expiration of the statutory period, when the notice of appeal was timely filed and the late filing of the transcript did not cause unreasonable delay. Hill Aircraft &amp; Leasing Corp. v. Planes, Inc., 169 Ga. App. 161, 312 S.E.2d 119 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When the appellant's notice of appeal states, in essential part, only the following:</b> "Comes now defendant in the above styled cause, and files his Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals of Georgia," the notice of appeal does not satisfy the requirements of the Appellate Practice Act and, therefore, must be dismissed.

<p class="p4">When it was apparent from the notice of appeal, the record, the enumeration of errors, or any combination of the foregoing, what judgment or judgments were appealed from or what errors were sought to be asserted upon appeal, the appeal was not subject to dismissal and shall be considered in accordance therewith.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to include dismissal of city as defendant.</b> - Because it is clear from the enumerations of error that plaintiffs sought to appeal from the trial court's dismissal of the city as a defendant, as well as the grant of summary judgment as to other defendants, the failure to include the dismissal of the city in the notice of appeal does not prevent the court's review of the matter. Rea v. Bunce, 179 Ga. App. 628, 347 S.E.2d 676 (1986), overruled on other grounds, Martin v. Department of Pub. Safety, 357 S.E.2d 569 (Ga. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 998, 108 S. Ct. 685, 98 L.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the appealable decision or judgment complained of; but when a motion for new trial, a motion in arrest of judgment, or a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict has been filed, the notice shall be filed within 30 days after the entry of the order granting, overruling, or otherwise finally disposing of the motion. In civil cases, the appellee may institute cross appeal by filing notice thereof within 15 days from service of the notice of appeal by the appellant; and the appellee may present for adjudication on the cross appeal all errors or rulings adversely affecting him; and in no case shall the appellee be required to institute an independent appeal on his own right, although the appellee may at his option file an independent appeal. The notice of cross appeal shall set forth the title and docket number of the case, the name of the appellee, the name and address of his attorney, and a designation of any portions of the record or transcript designated for omission by the appellant and which the appellee desires included and shall state that the appellee takes a cross appeal. In all cases where the notice of appeal did not specify that a transcript of evidence and proceedings was to be transmitted as a part of the record on appeal, the notice of cross appeal shall state whether such transcript is to be filed for inclusion in the record on appeal. A copy of the notice of cross appeal shall be served on other parties of record in the manner prescribed by Code Section 5-6-32. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Where a cross appeal is filed and only one record (and transcript, where required) is sent up, the court shall by order provide for the division of costs therefor between the parties if they are unable to do so by agreement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Requirements of section are jurisdictional</b> and failure to comply with those requirements mandates dismissal of appeal. Thompkins v. State, 157 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that appellant was a fugitive from justice</b> does not excuse noncompliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38. Noncompliance with <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38 is not remedied simply because the appellant is a fugitive from justice until after expiration of time allowed for filing of notice of appeal.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction when meaning of section is unambiguous.</b> - When language is plain, unambiguous, and positive, and is not capable of two constructions, no court has a right to construe the statute to mean anything other than what the statute declares, and this rule, of course, precludes courts from construing the statute according to what is supposed to be legislative intent. Bailey v. Bonaparte, 125 Ga. App. 512, 188 S.E.2d 119 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Word "appellee" as used in section should be liberally construed.</b> - Interpretation of word "appellee," as used in section, to mean only party against whom appeal is taken and who has a particular interest adverse to setting aside judgment appealed is too restrictive because a liberal construction of section comports with policies of this article, enhances efficient administration of justice, and avoids multiplicity of appeals.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disposition of appeal not res judicata regarding issues raised by subsequent motion for new trial.</b> - When notice of appeal is filed before filing of extraordinary motion for new trial, disposition of appeal will not be res judicata as to issues raised by subsequently filed motion.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extraordinary motion for new trial.</b> - Extraordinary motion for new trial was improper when the motion was based only on the general grounds and various evidentiary rulings made during the course of the trial, these are matters which could and should have been discovered and raised in a timely filed ordinary motion for new trial. Bohannon v. State, 203 Ga. App. 783, 417 S.E.2d 679 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Addressing of errors in first trial when new trial granted.</b> - When the trial court grants a motion for a directed verdict, then grants a motion for a new trial, ruling that the directed verdict motion was improvidently granted, and a second trial is conducted, followed by an appeal by the losing party, the appellate court is concerned only with the trial court's orders in the second trial and cannot address any enumerations of error as to the final orders of the trial court in the previous trial, as these judgments were not timely appealed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court had jurisdiction over appeal.</b> - When a defendant filed a notice of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, having previously filed a motion for a new trial after the verdict but before the defendant was sentenced, and later withdrew the motion for new trial, the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the defendant's appeal. Hann v. State, 292 Ga. App. 719, 665 S.E.2d 731 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illness and death of sole counsel for nonresident litigant does not excuse noncompliance with section.</b> - Not even illness and death of sole counsel for nonresident litigant, unaware of this fact, affords Supreme Court grounds for hearing and determining writ of error (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-49, 5-6-50) not sued out within time required by section.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment cannot be considered appealable until actually entered.</b> - Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider enumerations of error arising from breach of contract claim, since the jury's verdict on the claim was never reduced to judgment because of the plaintiff's election to have judgment entered on the plaintiff's theory of fraud. Miner v. Harrison, 205 Ga. App. 523, 422 S.E.2d 899, cert. denied, 205 Ga. App. 900, 422 S.E.2d 899 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No requirement to appeal within 30 days when order appealed from not final judgment.</b> - Trial court erred in denying the children's petition for writ of mandamus to compel a judge to allow the children to appeal from the order dismissing the children's appeals because the judge's prior orders were not final judgments within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(a)(1); thus, the children were not required to appeal from the rulings within 30 days after entry in order to preserve the children's right to pursue appellate review under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(a).

<p class="p4">Defendant's appeals did not qualify as direct appeals from the entry of the defendant's guilty pleas because the defendants were from a ruling on a motion filed ten years after the entry of judgment and sentence and were filed pursuant to notices of appeal that referred to the denial of the motion to void judgment.

<p class="p4">Dismissal or denial of a new trial due to failure to provide the transcript is, for purposes of subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38, an order "finally disposing" of the motion, triggering the 30 days for filing of an appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Order sustaining motion to dismiss on merits and providing self-executing dismissal provision.</b> - Order sustaining general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) on merits and providing self-executing dismissal provision is a final order. If no notice of appeal is filed beforehand, case is not automatically dismissed until expiration of time allowed for amendments and an appeal within 30 days after such date is timely. Chambers v. Peacock Constr. Co., 115 Ga. App. 670, 155 S.E.2d 704, aff'd, 223 Ga. 515, 156 S.E.2d 348 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order affecting earlier final judgment.</b> - Trial court's corrective action in clarifying an omission as to post-trial interest in the court's earlier partial summary judgment, which had been certified as final, constituted a final order which was directly appealable. Nodvin v. West, 197 Ga. App. 92, 397 S.E.2d 581 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment not final as to all parties.</b> - In the absence of an express determination and express direction pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-54(b), the denial of a motion for a new trial as to fewer than all the parties against whom a new trial has actually been sought is not itself a final judgment, does not otherwise terminate the action even as to those in whose favor judgment has previously been entered, and is subject to revision at any time prior to the entry of a judgment as to all parties. Accordingly, the denial of such a motion is not an order "otherwise finally disposing of the motion" so as to trigger the 30-day period established by subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38 for the filing of a notice appeal, unless and until there has been compliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-54(b).

<p class="p4">Although a trial court made no factual determination concerning the defendant's failure to pursue a direct appeal, a habeas court had previously determined that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily withdrew the new trial motion against the advice of counsel and waived the right to a direct appeal; as a result, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(a) and properly limited the record. Simmons v. State, 276 Ga. 525, 579 S.E.2d 735 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of complaint against one of two defendants.</b> - Because an insured could not use a voluntary dismissal of one of the defendants as the vehicle for appellate review of rulings entered by the trial court more than 30 days from the filing of the notice of appeal, and no other final appealable ruling existed in the record, the insured's appeal was dismissed based on the appellate court's lack of jurisdiction. Waye v. Continental Special Risks, Inc., 289 Ga. App. 82, 656 S.E.2d 150 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 392 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Direct appeals may be taken from contempt orders.</b> - Appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the prior orders specified in the notice of appeal because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(a)(2) expressly authorized a direct appeal from an order of contempt.

<p class="p4"><b>Pending motion when final judgment entered does not extend time for appeal.</b> - Hospital's motion to dismiss an appeal was granted because the order granting summary judgment was a final judgment since the order concluded the case and the fact that the ancillary issue of the cost award under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-4(d) remained pending did not prevent the judgment from being final for purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-34(a)(1) and 5-6-38(a); thus, the appeal was untimely since the appeal was brought outside of the 30-day time frame from the trial court's entry of judgment.

<p class="p4"><b>Trial court exceeded its authority.</b> - When a trial court effectively granted the defendant an 11-month extension of time under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-39(c) in which to file a notice of appeal, the appeal was dismissed because the trial court lacked authority under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(a) to do so. Cody v. State, 277 Ga. 553, 592 S.E.2d 419 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Timely filing of notice, delaying motion or grant of extension necessary.</b> - When 30-day period after entry of judgment on verdict expires and no notice of appeal has been filed, no extension of time therefor obtained, nor motion filed which would toll time for filing of notice of appeal, judgment, is unappealed from and becomes law of case. Venable v. Block, 141 Ga. App. 523, 233 S.E.2d 878 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an application for discretionary review was not filed, and a subsequent notice of direct appeal was filed untimely, there was no jurisdiction conferred on the court to hear the appeal. Boney v. State, 236 Ga. App. 179, 510 S.E.2d 892 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">For Court of Appeals to acquire jurisdiction over case, notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of judgment appealed from, unless an extension is granted upon proper application to the trial court, and motion for reconsideration of order granting summary judgment and dismissing counterclaim does not extend deadline for filing notice of appeal from that order.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of denial of new trial motion.</b> - Disposition of the motion for new trial obviated all need for an out-of-time appeal, since the defendant had 30 days after entry of that judgment in which to file an ordinary appeal. Nevertheless, while the denial of the new trial motion was the demise of the notice of appeal, filed earlier, as an out-of-time appeal, it served to vitalize it as a timely appeal. As a premature notice of appeal it became effective upon entry of a final judgment. Shirley v. State, 188 Ga. App. 357, 373 S.E.2d 257 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Premature notice of appeal when no prejudice will result.</b> - If notice of appeal is sufficient to advise opposing party that appeal is being taken from specific judgment, and if no prejudice will result to appellee in allowing appeal, then an appeal should not be dismissed merely because the notice is premature.

<p class="p4">Defendant's motion for an out of time appeal was the functional equivalent of a timely notice of appeal and was treated as such when the document: (1) was filed within the 30-day time limit of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38 for filing a notice of appeal since the notice was filed within 30 days of the filing date of the order which denied the defendant's motion for a new trial; (2) was served upon the state; and (3) undeniably evinced the defendant's intention to seek appellate review of the denial of the motion for a new trial and gave notice to the state of that intent.

<p class="p4"><b>Motion to review or reconsider filed after 30 days.</b> - When the appellant does not file a motion to review or reconsider until well after the 30 days allowed for notice of appeal, the appeal is not properly and timely filed so as to invoke the jurisdiction of the appellate court, and the appeal must be dismissed. Stonecypher v. State, 168 Ga. App. 507, 308 S.E.2d 639 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal for late filing.</b> - Defendant's pro se motion appealing the denial of the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal and/or extraordinary motion for new trial was properly dismissed for untimeliness when the defendant waited until three months after the defendant's conviction to appeal, the defendant's appeal was not properly designated, and failed to enumerate any error relating to the trial.

Because the defendant failed to show good cause for the untimely motion, it could not be construed as an extraordinary motion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41(b), and even if it were so construed, the defendant did not follow the discretionary appeal procedure of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35.

<p class="p4"><b>Time for filing expired.</b> - It was not an abuse of discretion to deny the defendant's motion for a new trial, requested to facilitate the defendant's efforts to become a naturalized citizen, because the trial court considered that the defendant's sentence for giving a false name to an officer had long since been served, that six years had passed since sentencing, and that the sentence was within the statutory guidelines for misdemeanors; claims the defendant's guilty plea was not voluntary were of no avail as the defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or to appeal and the times for doing so had expired.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure of state to file cross-appeal.</b> - When an inmate appealed a habeas court's original order granting the inmate a new appeal in the inmate's criminal case, and the state failed to file a cross-appeal from that original order, the state was not allowed to pursue an appeal of the habeas court's later order on remand granting the inmate a new trial; the merits of the issue were reached and resolved in the habeas court's earlier final order, and the state's attempt to challenge those merits in the instant appeal was untimely.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ineffective assistance of counsel.</b> - Out-of-time appeal was appropriate when, as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, a timely direct appeal was not taken, and the movant for an out-of-time appeal needed to establish a good and sufficient reason entitling the movant to such an appeal; the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal was properly denied when the defendant claimed that the defendant's trial counsel did not provide the defendant with a copy of the plea hearing transcript, but also stated that the defendant first tried to obtain a copy of the transcript nearly eight months after the defendant's guilty plea and conviction, well after the time for a direct appeal had passed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for out-of-time appeal denied.</b> - Denial of the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal from the defendant's conviction and sentence after the entry of a guilty plea was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant's claims that the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel did not show that defense counsel's conduct frustrated the defendant's right to appeal, the defendant did not have an unqualified right to appeal after the entry of a guilty plea, defendant failed to show how the trial court deviated from the negotiated plea as the record showed that the sentence matched the recommendation, and the defendant was not entitled to expand the record in an attempt to meet the defendant's burden for an out-of-time appeal. Jackson v. State, 266 Ga. App. 461, 597 S.E.2d 535 (2004), overruled on other grounds by Collier v. State, 834 S.E.2d 769, 2019 Ga. LEXIS 708 (Ga. 2019). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for an out-of-time direct appeal after the defendant plead guilty. The defendant had not shown that the issues raised could be decided upon facts appearing in the record and did not contend that ineffectiveness of counsel frustrated the defendant's right to file a timely direct appeal; rather, the defendant asserted that counsel failed to investigate, failed to object to the sufficiency of the accusation, failed to personally negotiate the plea agreement, and failed to file a material document. Smith v. State, 291 Ga. App. 459, 662 S.E.2d 253 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendant's pro se motion for an out-of-time direct appeal was properly denied because the defendant's claims were meritless. A plea petition and a transcript showed that the defendant's guilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, and by not objecting to the failure to be placed under oath at the guilty plea hearing, the defendant waived the requirement of an oath. Sweeting v. State, 291 Ga. App. 693, 662 S.E.2d 785 (2008), overruled on other grounds by Collier v. State, 834 S.E.2d 769, 2019 Ga.

<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal. Based on a plea acknowledgment form, counsel's certification, and the plea colloquy, there was no merit to the defendant's claims that the defendant had not been informed of the nature of the charges and that the trial court failed to establish a factual basis for the defendant's guilty plea. Colbert v. State, 284 Ga. 81, 663 S.E.2d 158 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal. The defendant clearly stated the defendant's desire to discontinue the services of trial counsel and accept punishment; in addition, although counsel informed the defendant of the appeal deadline after giving the defendant notice of counsel's intent to withdraw, the defendant waited 18 years before seeking an out-of-time appeal.

<p class="p4">Defendant failed to show an abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal because the defendant failed to demonstrate in the current appeal that the defendant's direct appeal of right of the defendant's convictions and sentences was lost due to the professional deficiency of any attorney as the record showed that the defendant's attempted pro se direct appeal was properly dismissed as untimely.

<p class="p4"><b>Momentary incapacity of attorney.</b> - Contention that the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel when the defendant entered the defendant's guilty plea because the defendant's attorney suffered from laryngitis was not a sufficient reason for granting an out-of-time appeal, there being no claim of substantive or technical ineffectiveness on the part of counsel.

<p class="p4"><b>Opposing counsel's consent to late filing.</b> - Without proper and timely filing of notice of appeal, dismissal is required in spite of the fact of consent given by opposing counsel to the late appeal, as parties may not give jurisdiction to a court by consent, express or implied, as to the person or subject matter of an action.

<p class="p6"><b>2. What Motions Extend Time for Filing</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion to set aside judgment.</b> - There is at least one motion not enumerated in subsection (a) which has effect of extending time for filing notice of appeal, to wit: a motion to set aside judgment. Johnson v. Barnes, 237 Ga. 502, 229 S.E.2d 70 (1976). (But see MMT Enters., Inc. v. Cullars, 218 Ga. App. 559, 462 S.E.2d 771 (1995)). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Motion to set aside, even though based on a nonamendable defect and/or lack of jurisdiction, cannot extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. MMT Enters., Inc. v. Cullars, 218 Ga. App. 559, 462 S.E.2d 771 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Pendency of motion for new trial</b> extends time for filing a notice of appeal. Hughes v. Newell, 152 Ga. App. 618, 263 S.E.2d 505 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Motion to dismiss appeal on ground that notice of appeal was filed more than 30 days after judgment of conviction was without merit, when intervening time was tolled by motion for new trial, the judgment denying which was filed 29 days prior to filing of notice of appeal. Reed v. State, 163 Ga. App. 364, 295 S.E.2d 108 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for new trial must be timely filed to toll time.</b> - When purported motion for new trial was not filed within 30 days as required by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 70-301 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-40), it was thus void and of no effect, and therefore did not toll time for filing notice of appeal under Ga. L. 1968, p. 1072, <span class="s1">§</span> 7. Johnson v. State, 227 Ga. 219, 180 S.E.2d 94 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An untimely motion for new trial is void and does not operate to toll the time for filing of the notice of appeal. Wright v. Rhodes, 198 Ga. App. 269, 401 S.E.2d 35 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appealling denial of exoneration and discharge as void.</b> - Trial court's 1998 sentencing order denying the defendant exoneration and discharge was void as a matter of law because the state never filed a motion for revocation; thus, exoneration and discharge was automatic under the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-60(e), (g), and (h), and the defendant's motion to correct a void sentence was improperly denied. Collins v. State, 338 Ga. App. 886, 792 S.E.2d 134 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Arrest of judgment" refers to criminal appeals.</b> - Exclusive method by which civil judgments may be attacked is set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-60 and an arrest of judgment is not enumerated therein. Thus, even though O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38 lists "arrest of judgment" as one of the motions which extends the time for filing a notice of appeal, it apparently refers to criminal appeals. Daniels v. McRae, 180 Ga. App. 732, 350 S.E.2d 317 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Petition to set aside probate court determination.</b> - Claimant's "petition to set aside" a probate court determination that she was not the widow of the decedent was properly treated as a motion for new trial, which tolled the time for appeal to the superior court. Reid v. Reid, 201 Ga. App. 530, 411 S.E.2d 754 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion for reconsideration was treated as motion for new trial.</b> - Buyer's pending motion for reconsideration in a state court suit was construed as a motion for a new trial since nomenclature did not control and the motion raised both factual and legal issues by claiming that the evidence did not show fraud by the buyer because the brokerage agreement with a real estate broker had expired when the buyer purchased the property; since the motion for reconsideration was a motion for a new trial, the motion tolled the time for filing an appeal and the judgment in the state court suit was not final under Georgia law for collateral estoppel purposes in an adversary proceeding in a bankruptcy court.

<p class="p4">Denial of a motion which does not purport to be based either on a nonamendable defect or on a lack of jurisdiction but is simply a request for the trial court to reconsider the court's decision, is not appealable in the motion's own right pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-60(d), and the filing of such a motion does not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Second application for appeal untimely.</b> - Because plaintiff filed a second application for discretionary appeal on June 28, 2010, after withdrawing the plaintiff's motion for new trial, the motion was untimely as the motion was filed 61 days after the entry of the judgment on April 28, 2010; pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38, the trial court had to dispose of the motion for new trial to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Notice held untimely.</b> - When cross-appellants contended that because appellant in August 1986 successfully moved the trial court to allow the appellant to amend the appellant's notice of appeal merely to change the designated parts of the record necessary to the appellant's appeal and thus to delete certain portions of the record, this constituted a novation or extension of the appellant's original notice of appeal of April 11, 1986, it was held that the filing of the cross appeal in the Supreme Court on August 25 must be related to the original notice of appeal filed by appellant April 11 and could draw life from a mere modification of the notice of appeal reducing the amount of record as originally noticed in the original appeal. It followed that the filing of the notice of cross appeal on August 25, 1986, was far beyond the 15 days allowed for the filing of such a cross appeal. Mobley v. Coast House, Ltd., 182 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to file notice of cross appeal makes review of brief unnecessary.</b> - When appellee denominates one section of the appellee's brief a "cross appeal," but the record reveals that no notice of cross appeal was ever filed, the Court of Appeals need not address this contention in view of subsections (a) and (b) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38.

<p class="p4"><b>Habeas petitioner may cross-appeal without a certificate of probable cause.</b> - When a habeas petitioner is denied relief and wishes to appeal, he or she generally must first seek authorization to appeal by filing an application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal. However, the Supreme Court of Georgia previously has permitted habeas petitioners to pursue cross-appeals under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(b) regarding the partial denial of their habeas petitions without first obtaining such a certificate of probable cause since the warden is already appealing in the case.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grounds for out of time appeal.</b> - Motion for out of time appeal was properly denied when the appellant alleged only that the appellant's attorney's inadequate performance was the reason why no timely appeal was filed and appellant failed to set forth the questions the appellant would raise in an out of time appeal and that the questions could be resolved by facts in the record. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a direct appeal cannot be taken from a guilty plea on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel unless that issue was developed through a post-plea hearing, it cannot be said that the defendant's right of appeal was frustrated; simply put, the defendant had no right of appeal and the defendant's remedy lay in a habeas corpus proceeding.

<p class="p4"><b>Burden is on party desiring to take appeal.</b> - Burden is on party desiring to take appeal to determine when judgment is filed in trial court, and to file the party's notice of appeal within the 30-day period or within the duly authorized extension of the 30-day period. Jordan v. Caldwell, 229 Ga. 343, 191 S.E.2d 530 (1972); Associated Distribs., Inc. v. Willard, 242 Ga. 247, 248 S.E.2d 645 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a litigant's appeal was untimely filed, despite evidence of mistaken delivery beyond the litigant's control the superior court properly held that the court lacked discretion to find otherwise, as the burden to timely file an appeal could not be relieved by providential cause and excusable neglect; thus, the court did not err in dismissing the appeal.

<p class="p4">Defendant's motion for new trial filed more than 30 days after the entry of judgment was untimely under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-40(a), void, and did not toll the 30-day time to file a notice of appeal provided by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-38(a). Because the defendant failed to show good cause for the untimely motion, it could not be construed as an extraordinary motion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-5-41(b), and even if it were so construed, the defendant did not follow the discretionary appeal procedure of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35.

<p class="p4">Trial court properly dismissed the debtors' appeal as a transcript was not filed until over two months after the statutory due date, and the debtors did not request an extension of time to file the transcript; any delay in completing the record past the 30 days granted by statute was presumptively unreasonable and inexcusable.

<p class="p4"><b>Extension granted after period ran.</b> - Although the trial court entered an order granting the motion for an extension of time to file the plaintiff's notice of appeal after the extension period ran, the plaintiff filed a timely motion for extension that the trial court had the authority to grant and, in fact, granted, and the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal within the extension period permitted by statute; thus, the appellate court had jurisdiction to decide the plaintiff's appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Filing during unauthorized second extension.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-39, the trial court is authorized to grant only one extension of time for filing of notice of appeal; thus, filing of notice of appeal during unauthorized second extension comes too late to satisfy requirement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-48.

<p class="p4">Trial court was permitted to deny the defendant's second request for an extension of time to file the defendant's notice of appeal because statutory law allowed only one extension of time to be granted for filing a notice of appeal; thus, the defendant's request for an out-of-time appeal after the defendant did not timely file the defendant's notice of appeal was properly denied as it was the defendant's own conduct which caused the defendant to fail to timely file the notice of appeal in spite of the fact the defendant knew both about the right to appeal and the right to obtain appointed counsel.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delay in filing of transcript is not necessarily cause for dismissal.</b> - Because there was no evidence that an 11-day delay in the filing of a transcript for transmission as part of the appellate record discernibly delayed the docketing of the record in the appellate court, the trial court abused the court's discretion by concluding that the delay was unreasonable, and erred by dismissing an appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Delay must have been unreasonable and inexcusable.</b> - Failure of the appellant to request an extension for the filing of the transcript is not in itself a ground for dismissal of the appeal absent a judicial determination that the resulting delay was both unreasonable and inexcusable.

<p class="p4">In a dental malpractice case, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal because there was some evidence that the delay in the filing of the transcript on the part of the plaintiff was excusable and not caused by the plaintiff as emails were presented showing that the court reporter indicated that the reporter could not meet the various deadlines.

<p class="p4"><b>Determination of whether to grant extension without notice or hearing.</b> - Court reporter is amenable to trial judge for prompt and efficient performance of the court reporter's duties.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Only alleged errors occurring in lower court may be enumerated in appeal,</b> and a statute may not be constitutionally attacked for first time in enumerations of error so as to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction of the appeal. Kohl v. Manning, 223 Ga. 755, 158 S.E.2d 375 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Any ruling or judgment of court affecting judgment appealed from</b> may be enumerated as error by the appellant. Allen v. Rome Kraft Co., 114 Ga. App. 717, 152 S.E.2d 618 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Overruling of motion for new trial</b> does affect judgment on verdict, and may be enumerated. Allen v. Rome Kraft Co., 114 Ga. App. 717, 152 S.E.2d 618 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setting forth erroneous ruling required.</b> - Error of law has as its basis a specific ruling made by the trial court. In order for an appellate court to review a trial court ruling for legal error, a party must set forth in the enumeration of errors the allegedly erroneous ruling. Felix v. State, 271 Ga. 534, 523 S.E.2d 1 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setting forth arguments not required.</b> - Because the arguments supporting a position concerning a legal ruling are not themselves legal rulings, they do not have to be enunciated in the enumeration of errors in order to merit appellate consideration. Felix v. State, 271 Ga. 534, 523 S.E.2d 1 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of motion to suppress.</b> - Remand was required when the defendants adequately set out in the defendants' enumeration of errors that the defendants sought appellate review of the trial court's denial of the defendants' motion to suppress and the Court of Appeals did not address all the arguments raised by the defendants in support of the defendants' enumerated error. Felix v. State, 271 Ga. 534, 523 S.E.2d 1 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Each enumeration may contain only one error.</b> MacDonald v. MacDonald, 156 Ga. App. 565, 275 S.E.2d 142 (1980); Garvey v. State, 176 Ga. App. 268, 335 S.E.2d 640 (1985); Hayes v. State, 189 Ga. App. 39, 375 S.E.2d 114 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On appeal each enumeration of error should address only one error. Pope v. Triangle Chem. Co., 157 Ga. App. 386, 277 S.E.2d 758 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When there are two separate bases for the argument made, each ground should be separately enumerated. Bounds v. State, 207 Ga. App. 665, 428 S.E.2d 673 (1993). But see Felix v. State, 271 Ga. 534, 523 S.E.2d 1 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the defendant asserts several errors in one enumeration, the court will address only one asserted error, especially when the defendant raises new grounds for some of the defendant's objections for the first time on appeal. Rocha v. State, 234 Ga. App. 48, 506 S.E.2d 192 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Must clearly appear.</b> - It is desirable that each enumeration be explicit, precise, intelligible, unambiguous, unmistakable, and unequivocal. But, a degree of generality may be tolerated. This is not to be used as a sword against an appellee to enlarge or amend an enumeration of error, or to encompass bases of objection not fairly included within legitimate parameters urged at trial, but is a shield to accommodate appeal of specific allegation of error. MacDonald v. MacDonald, 156 Ga. App. 565, 275 S.E.2d 142 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of enumeration.</b> - Correct rule with respect to the legal sufficiency of any enumeration of error is that it need be only sufficient to point out the error complained of. Childers v. Tauber, 160 Ga. App. 713, 288 S.E.2d 5 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error sufficiently "set out separately."</b> - In order to take into account the duty imposed by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-48(f), when the enumeration of errors filed in the appellate court identifies the trial court ruling asserted to be error, the error relied upon is sufficiently "set out separately" to require the appellate court to shoulder the court's constitutional responsibility to be a court of review. Felix v. State, 271 Ga. 534, 523 S.E.2d 1 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Pro se litigants.</b> - Enumerations of error that were not in compliance with appellate rules would be considered in deference to the appellant's pro se status. Bennett v. Moody, 225 Ga. App. 95, 483 S.E.2d 350 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of several assertions of error in single enumeration.</b> - Court of Appeals may, in the exercise of the court's sound discretion, elect to review any one or more of the several assertions of error contained within a single enumeration and to treat the remaining assertions of error therein as abandoned. West v. Nodvin, 196 Ga. App. 825, 397 S.E.2d 567 (1990); Reid v. State, 237 Ga. App. 690, 515 S.E.2d 201 (1999). But see Felix v.

<p class="p4">When an appellant argues more than one error within a single enumeration, the appellate court in the court's discretion may elect to review none of the errors enumerated in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-40, or may elect to review any one or more of the several assertions of error contained within the single enumeration and treat the remaining assertions of error therein as abandoned. Robinson v. State, 200 Ga. App. 515, 408 S.E.2d 820 (1991); Wingfield v. State, 229 Ga. App. 75, 493 S.E.2d 235 (1997). But see Felix v.

<p class="p4"><b>Multiple assertions of errors in single enumeration were not reviewed.</b> White v. State, 221 Ga. App. 860, 473 S.E.2d 539 (1996); In re D.A.D., 224 Ga. App. 527, 481 S.E.2d 262 (1997); Duggan v. State, 225 Ga. App. 291, 483 S.E.2d 373 (1997); Stubbs v. Harmon, 226 Ga. App. 631, 487 S.E.2d 91 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>When it is apparent what errors are sought to be asserted, appeal shall be considered.</b> - When it is apparent from notice of appeal, record, enumeration of errors, or any combination of the foregoing, what errors are sought to be asserted upon appeal, an appeal shall be considered notwithstanding that enumeration of errors fails to enumerate clearly the errors sought to be reviewed. MacDonald v. MacDonald, 156 Ga. App. 565, 275 S.E.2d 142 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate brief not sufficient to raise error.</b> - Arguments raised in the appellate brief are not made issues on appeal unless they are properly enumerated as error; thus, a food vendor's argument in an appeal in a personal injury action that a certain jury charge should have been given was not properly preserved for review where the issue was raised in the vendor's brief but was not enumerated as error. Imperial Foods Supply, Inc. v. Purvis, 260 Ga. App. 614, 580 S.E.2d 342 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Application</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Vague enumeration may still be sufficient.</b> - Motion to strike the appellant's enumeration of error should be denied when, though hazy, the motion still conforms to practically unlimited looseness authorized by section. MacDonald v. MacDonald, 156 Ga. App. 565, 275 S.E.2d 142 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of enumeration of error which is too vague.</b> - When enumerated error is so general and does not contain a key which the brief clarifies to identify specific error enumerated, and neither record nor notice of appeal assists in determining which one specific error is enumerated, appellate court will consider only the general grounds as to sufficiency of facts to support judgment.

<p class="p4"><b>Appeal not dismissed for erroneous reference.</b> - Motion to dismiss appeal is not meritorious when based upon the fact that enumeration of errors refers to the wrong date as to order it complains of but when notice of appeal refers to correct date in record. Langford v. First Nat'l Bank, 122 Ga. App. 210, 176 S.E.2d 484 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enumeration setting forth each demurrer by its paragraph number.</b> - Requirement that enumeration of error set out separately errors relied upon does not make necessary a separate numbering as to each of various numbered demurrers (now motions to dismiss) sustained, but an enumeration of error on sustaining of such demurrers setting forth each demurrer by its paragraph number is sufficient. Mull v. Emory Univ., Inc., 114 Ga. App. 63, 150 S.E.2d 276 (1966). But see Felix v. State, 271 Ga. 534, 523 S.E.2d 1 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where record includes motion.</b> - In appeal from judgment of trial court overruling appellant-condemnor's motion for new trial, mere enumeration of judgment as error, without separately enumerating as error each ground of such motion, is sufficient compliance with section when motion as amended is included in the record and when the appellant's brief argues each ground separately. City of Douglas v. Rigdon, 116 Ga. App. 306, 157 S.E.2d 66 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Raising inadequacy of damages by enumerating general grounds of motion for new trial.</b> - Although good practice would call for enumerating as error the inadequacy of the jury's verdict for damages, the question of inadequacy is sufficiently raised for consideration by the court when overruling of general grounds of motion for new trial is enumerated as error, and question of inadequacy of verdict is presented and argued in briefs. Kirkman v. Miller, 116 Ga. App. 78, 156 S.E.2d 558 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere general enumeration to denial of amended motion for new trial</b> is insufficient. Dean v. State, 163 Ga. App. 29, 293 S.E.2d 492 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One enumeration is sufficient to reach all grounds.</b> - When error alleged is in granting or denying of a new trial, one assignment of error is sufficient to reach all grounds of the motion on which grant or refusal was based. National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Ozburn, 42 Ga. App. 393, 156 S.E. 305 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 6332).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exception to sufficiency of evidence when error concerns sufficiency of petition.</b> - When the plaintiff's failure to recover is dependent not upon insufficiency of evidence, but upon insufficiency of the petition, manifestly an assignment of error even in a direct bill of exceptions (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-49, 5-6-50) in which insufficiency of the petition can be reached, which excepts only to sufficiency of evidence and does not except to sufficiency of the petition, is insufficient to present for decision any question respecting insufficiency of the petition to set out a cause of action; although it would be otherwise, perhaps, if it appeared affirmatively from the petition that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. Huson v. Farmer, 53 Ga. App. 131, 185 S.E. 119 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 6-901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enumeration regarding admission of allegedly prejudicial evidence.</b> - Enumeration of error upon admission of evidence complaining that the admission created a false and prejudicial issue, in order to be complete, must set out how evidence was prejudicial and what false issue was created. Essig v. Cheves, 75 Ga. App. 870, 44 S.E.2d 712 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 6-1607).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Enumerations containing multiple allegations of error and failure to address each enumeration.</b> - In an appeal from contempt orders entered in a child custody case, a parent and the parent's attorney failed to comply with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-40 and Ga. Ct. App. R. 10, 25(a), and 25(c)(1); the brief and enumerations of error were rambling and difficult to follow and those arguments that were unsupported by authority were deemed abandoned.

<p class="p4">Defendant's motion to amend the defendant's out-of-time appeal, presenting additional grounds, was denied because the motion was filed 49 days after the appeal was docketed, and enumerations of error must be filed within 20 days of docketing.

Where it is determined that the parties, or either of them, are financially unable to pay the costs of reporting or transcribing, the judge may, in the judge's discretion, authorize trial of the case unreported; and, when it becomes necessary for a transcript of the evidence and proceedings to be prepared, it shall be the duty of the moving party to prepare the transcript from recollection or otherwise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where a trial in any civil or criminal case is reported by a court reporter, all motions, colloquies, objections, rulings, evidence, whether admitted or stricken on objection or otherwise, copies or summaries of all documentary evidence, the charge of the court, and all other proceedings which may be called in question on appeal or other posttrial procedure shall be reported; and, where the report is transcribed, all such matters shall be included in the written transcript, it being the intention of this article that all these matters appear in the record. Where matters occur which were not reported, such as objections to oral argument, misconduct of the jury, or other like instances, the court, upon motion of either party, shall require that a transcript of these matters be made and included as a part of the record. The transcript of proceedings shall not be reduced to narrative form unless by agreement of counsel; but, where the trial is not reported or the transcript of the proceedings for any other reason is not available and the evidence is prepared from recollection, it may be prepared in narrative form. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In criminal cases where the accused was convicted of a capital felony, an additional copy shall be filed for the Attorney General, for which the court reporter shall receive compensation from the Department of Law as provided by law. The original transcript shall be transmitted to the appellate court as a part of the record on appeal; and one copy will be retained in the trial court, both as referred to in Code Section 5-6-43.

If anything material to either party is omitted from the record on appeal or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation, or the trial court, either before or after the record is transmitted to the appellate court, on a proper suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement shall be corrected and, if necessary, that a supplemental record shall be certified and transmitted by the clerk of the trial court.

In case of the inability of the parties to agree as to the correctness of such transcript, the decision of the trial judge thereon shall be final and not subject to review; and, if the trial judge is unable to recall what transpired, the judge shall enter an order stating that fact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One purpose of requirement of filing transcript under subsections (a) and (e)</b> is to afford local counsel in county where case was tried convenient access to exact duplicate copy of record so as to enable counsel to easily ascertain proper references to be included in counsel's brief and written argument. Law v. Smith, 226 Ga. 298, 174 S.E.2d 893 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section provides means of obtaining brief of evidence when not recorded at trial.</b> - When evidence was not reported, the only way of obtaining brief of evidence upon which the court may consider whether there should be a grant of the new trial is provided by this section and if the judge is unable to remember the evidence the evidence shall enter an order to that effect. Hill v. General Rediscount Corp., 116 Ga. App. 459, 157 S.E.2d 888 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award of attorney fees.</b> - Trial court's award of attorney fees to a corporation was upheld as the sheriff challenging the award failed to file a transcript, and the appellate court had to assume that the trial court was authorized to award the fees. Barrett v. Marathon Inv. Corp., 268 Ga. App. 196, 601 S.E.2d 516 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When defendant claimed that the jury was not sworn,</b> the defendant's remedy was to have the record corrected by following the provisions of subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41. Grant v. State, 237 Ga. App. 892, 515 S.E.2d 872 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Filed transcript constitutes public record.</b> - Once the prepared transcript is filed with the trial court clerk, it becomes a matter of public record to which all members of the public have reasonable access. Georgia Am. Ins. Co. v. Varnum, 182 Ga. App. 907, 357 S.E.2d 609 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exclusions from record not permitted.</b> - While the statutory scheme under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-43(a) contemplates requests by the appellee to include portions of the record that the appellant has designated for exclusion, it does not authorize the appellee to request exclusion of items the appellant desires to include. McHugh Fuller Law Group, PLLC v. PruittHealth-Toccoa, LLC, 297 Ga. 94, 772 S.E.2d 660 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in ordering the trial court clerk to omit from the appellate record all submissions filed after entry of the permanent injunction because the statutory scheme presumes that a complete record will be transmitted to the appellate court unless the appellant specifically requests otherwise. McHugh Fuller Law Group, PLLC v. PruittHealth-Toccoa, LLC, 297 Ga. 94, 772 S.E.2d 660 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant not obligated to prepare record.</b> - Obligation of the appellant relates to the transcript, and the obligation for the preparation of the record rests with the clerk. After the appellant has filed a notice of appeal, the appellant's duty as to the record is limited to the payment of costs. When the clerk fails to transmit the record, but there is no indication that this failure is occasioned by the failure of a party to pay costs, the trial court has no discretion to dismiss the appeal. Long v. City of Midway, 251 Ga. 364, 306 S.E.2d 639 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to transcription.</b> - Although trial counsel failed to inform the appellant of the right to have the trial and proceedings transcribed, the appellant, through appellate counsel, did not attempt to file a transcript or stipulation of the case pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41; accordingly, it is presumed that the lack of actual transcription was not prejudicial. Southerton v. State, 205 Ga. App. 366, 422 S.E.2d 251 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While any party in a civil case may, as a matter of right, have a case reported at the party's own expense, it is not incumbent upon the trial judge to arrange for the official reporter to take down the evidence, and when the plaintiff declined to have the hearing transcribed through a court reporter, the plaintiff could not later complain of the lack of a reporter. Hixson v. Hickson, 236 Ga. App. 894, 512 S.E.2d 648 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No transcript was either ordered or made for a trial.</b> - When there is no direct proof of prejudice or bias on the part of a jury, an appellate court can set aside the verdict as excessive only when the amount, considered in connection with all the facts in evidence at trial, shakes the moral senses, i.e., the verdict must carry its death warrant on the verdict's face; however, such issues must be determined from the trial transcript, and when no transcript was either ordered or made for a trial in which a jury entered a judgment against a mortgage company, and the mortgage company made no attempt to have the trial court make a transcript or a reconstructed transcript of the proceedings approved by the trial judge, the appellate court assumed that the judgment was correct and supported by the evidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Burden on appellant to prepare transcript.</b> - Burden is on the appellants to prepare a copy of the transcript for inclusion in the appellate record. Young v. First Am. Bank, 196 Ga. App. 348, 396 S.E.2d 73 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delay in filing of transcript is not necessarily cause for dismissal.</b> - Because there was no evidence that an 11-day delay in the filing of a transcript for transmission as part of the appellate record discernibly delayed the docketing of the record in the appellate court, the trial court abused the court's discretion by concluding that the delay was unreasonable, and erred by dismissing an appeal. Fulton County Bd. of Tax Assessors v. Love, 289 Ga. App. 252, 656 S.E.2d 576 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant only allowed 45 minutes to employ court reporter.</b> - Trial court did not err in only allowing defendant in forma pauperis 45 minutes in which to employ a court reporter after the defendant appeared at the hearing without one when the defendant was provided at least two weeks' notice of the date of the hearing and could have arranged for a court reporter to be present within this time period.

<p class="p4"><b>Transcript or stipulation of record prerequisite to consideration of errors.</b> - Enumeration of errors dependent upon transcript of evidence and proceedings cannot be reviewed by appellate court when it is not reported, there is a dispute between counsel of both parties as to what actually transpired at the hearing, and the trial court is unable to recall it.

<p class="p4">Defendant's claim, that the test results from a blood test were improperly admitted in a criminal trial because the state failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the blood tested was actually the defendant's blood, lacked merit, as the defendant failed to have a transcript created or attached to the appeal of a pretrial hearing on the motion in limine addressing that issue, and pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41(g), the appellate court presumed the trial was conducted in a regular and proper manner.

<p class="p4"><b>Incomplete transcript required new trial.</b> - Defendant was entitled to a new trial because, despite nearly two decades, the state was unable to complete the transcript, the court reporter for the trial died, memories faded, the jury charge, which was missing, was a crucial portion of the trial, and the missing transcript hindered counsel's ability to adequately and zealously represent the defendant.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in granting the state's motion to perfect the record with certified copies of the defendant's prior felony convictions for financial transaction credit card fraud, theft by receiving, and possession of cocaine because the trial court was authorized to find that certified copies of the defendant's three prior felony convictions were considered by the court at the sentencing hearing, even if their admission was tacit rather than explicit.

<p class="p4"><b>When trial judge has no independent recollection of trial.</b> - Criminal defendant's attempts to prepare and file a unilateral account of the proceedings below did not meet the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41, when the trial court had no independent recollection of the defendant's battery trial, and no transcript was available. Dunn v. State, 234 Ga. App. 623, 507 S.E.2d 170 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to timely transmit record and delay in raising issue.</b> - Defendant's due process rights were not violated by the trial court clerk's failure to timely transmit the record to the appellate court for docketing and resolution of the appeal because the defendant failed to raise this issue below, which contributed to the confusing state of the record, and the defendant failed to attempt any clarification or completion of the record via the remedies afforded by law during the seven year delay. Chernowski v. State, 330 Ga. App. 702, 769 S.E.2d 126 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an appeal of a criminal conviction, the appellate court chose to sua sponte reinstate the case to address the appellant's enumerations of error on the merits despite the failure to set forth in the notice of appeal the intention to rely upon a previously transmitted transcript because the court had not yet addressed the issue in a published opinion and used the case to place future appellants on notice that similar procedural errors may result in automatic affirmance of a trial court's decision.

Therefore, the appellate court's refusal to entertain, on motion for rehearing under subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41, under which the action originates in the trial court, the supplementation of the record was not error.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Written motion to supplement not required.</b> - By participating in the state's attempt to supplement the record during a hearing on a motion for new trial, a defendant acquiesced in the state's presentation of the state's theory that the trial court's admonition to the defendant of the right to testify was missing from the record, and it was not necessary that the state file a written motion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41(f) to supplement the record.

<p class="p4"><b>Indigent appellant must take steps to provide transcript.</b> - Although the trial court declared the appellant indigent, and directed the state to provide the appellant with a trial transcript, the appellant apparently took no steps, by making timely request or otherwise, to insure that the pretrial hearing regarding the appellant's motion in limine was duly recorded, nor did the appellant request that the trial court reconstruct this hearing. In the absence of this transcript, the appellate court could not consider the appellant's enumerated error as to the denial of the appellant's motion. Jones v. State, 187 Ga. App. 25, 369 S.E.2d 314 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Improper supplementation.</b> - Supplementation of the record by both the defendant and the state by appending attachments to their respective briefs was not an authorized method; the appellate court cannot consider the factual assertions of the parties appearing in briefs when the evidence does not appear on the record.

<p class="p4"><b>Lost transcripts.</b> - Plaintiff's motion for a new trial because transcripts and exhibits were lost or destroyed by the court reporter was properly denied when the trial court followed the proper procedure in recreating a narrative transcript, and evidence in the available transcript and the narrative transcript supported the jury's verdict.

<p class="p4">Because the defendant was deprived of an adequate trial transcript when a fire at the court reporter's house destroyed the tapes and materials for the transcript, the defendant was denied the defendant's right to appeal, and the defendant was therefore entitled to a new trial; the state's 14-page recreation of the six-day trial prepared under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41 was manifestly inadequate.

<p class="p4"><b>Entirety of record required.</b> - Trial court's denial of defendant's motion to vacate a sentence was affirmed because the defendant did not request that the entire record be transmitted to the appellate court, and, therefore, the appellate court was required to assume that the trial court ruled correctly.

<p class="p4">Although a tenant appealing a writ of possession in favor of a landlord made various arguments based on factual issues that required consideration of the evidence presented to the trial court, the tenant failed to file a transcript of the proceedings and failed to reconstruct the proceedings in accordance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41(g) and (i); the tenant had the burden to show error by the record, but failed to provide any evidence to support the allegations.

<p class="p4">When a wife appealed a trial court's decision to enforce the parties' postnuptial agreement but she failed to provide a transcript under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41, it was assumed that findings that there was full and fair disclosure of the husband's financial condition prior to execution of the agreement were supported by sufficient competent evidence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Certification of reconstructed transcript.</b> - When the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence at the defendant's trial, defendant's simply pointing out the absence of a ruling in the record on the defendant's motion to certify a reconstructed transcript did not carry the burden of showing that the trial court refused to rule on a reconstructed transcript, and since there was no transcript of the trial, the appellate court was bound to assume that the defendant's conviction was supported by evidence.

<p class="p4"><b>Restatement of judge's comments into record.</b> - When, after a lunch break during the guilt phase of the trial, the trial court made a few remarks to the jury while awaiting the return of the defendant, and the trial judge later restated the judge's comments, as well as the judge could remember the comments, into the record, relating that the judge had told the jury that the trial would be slightly delayed because the defendant had eaten late, and had congratulated one of the jurors for having been elected to the board of education, there was no violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41 or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-8-5, and any possible constitutional error relating to a defendant's right to be present during all stages of a defendant's trial was clearly harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

<p class="p4"><b>Recollected testimony of witnesses.</b> - When during a defendant's bench trial, the evidence was not recorded, the defendant did not request or otherwise arrange for recording and, afterwards, the state and the defendant were unable to agree on what transpired during trial, the defendant was afforded the next best thing to a transcript, i.e., the recollected testimony of all witnesses in the criminal trial plus the testimony of persons who observed it. What was recalled was sufficient to conclude that the denial of the defendant's motion for a new trial was proper. King v. State, 195 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>New trial not required for missing documents.</b> - Although the defendant contended that the defendant could not obtain full and fair appellate review of the defendant's convictions based on the five documents missing from the record of the defendant's trial, because the defendant did not show that the defendant had been prevented from raising any viable issue on appeal or otherwise harmed as a result of the minimally incomplete record, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on that ground.

Where there is a transcript of evidence and proceedings to be included in the record on appeal, the appellant shall cause the transcript to be prepared and filed as provided by Code Section 5-6-41; but, when the appellant has designated that the transcript not be made a part of the record on appeal and its inclusion is by reason of a designation thereof by appellee, the appellee shall cause the transcript to be prepared and filed as referred to in Code Section 5-6-41 at his expense. The party having the responsibility of filing the transcript shall cause it to be filed within 30 days after filing of the notice of appeal or designation by appellee, as the case may be, unless the time is extended as provided in Code Section 5-6-39.

<p class="p4"><b>Transcript materials destroyed by fire.</b> - Because the defendant was deprived of an adequate trial transcript when a fire at the court reporter's house destroyed the tapes and materials for the transcript, the defendant was denied the defendant's right to appeal, and the defendant was therefore entitled to a new trial; the state's 14-page recreation of the six-day trial prepared under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41 was manifestly inadequate.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant not obligated to prepare record.</b> - Obligation of the appellant relates to the transcript, and the obligation for the preparation of the record rests with the clerk. After the appellant has filed a notice of appeal, the appellant's duty as to the record is limited to the payment of costs. When the clerk fails to transmit the record, but there is no indication that this failure is occasioned by the failure of a party to pay costs, the trial court has no discretion to dismiss the appeal. Long v. City of Midway, 251 Ga. 364, 306 S.E.2d 639 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant had no obligation to file transcript until the appellant's motion for new trial was disposed of,</b> and the failure to do so or the failure to pay for and file the transcript as soon as it is ready has no controlling bearing on the question of unreasonable delay in filing the transcript after notice of appeal as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-42. Galletta v. Hillcrest Abbey W., Inc., 185 Ga. App. 20, 363 S.E.2d 265 (1987), cert. denied, 185 Ga. App. 910, 363 S.E.2d 265 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Appellate court will order trial clerk to submit omitted requests.</b> - Requests to charge are of such importance in an appeal when the trial court's giving of a charge is cited as error that the appellate court will order the clerk of the trial court to submit that portion of the trial record to the appellate court pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41(f), and a motion to strike the state's supplementation of the record to include the requests on the ground that it is tardily filed will be denied.

<p class="p4"><b>State's violation of duty does not excuse defendant's noncompliance.</b> - It is duty of state to request court reporter to transcribe reported testimony and then file transcript after guilty verdict had been returned in a felony case. However, the state's duty to request court reporter to transcribe reported testimony in felony conviction had no time limit and thus cannot relieve the appellant in felony conviction of duty the court reporter to request court reporter to transcribe reported testimony at same time that the court reporter files a notice of appeal.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Clerk's failure to timely transmit record and delay in raising issue.</b> - Defendant's due process rights were not violated by the trial court clerk's failure to timely transmit the record to the appellate court for docketing and resolution of the appeal because the defendant failed to raise this issue below, which contributed to the confusing state of the record, and the defendant failed to attempt any clarification or completion of the record via the remedies afforded by law during the seven year delay.

<p class="p4"><b>Transcript of hearing on motion for summary judgment.</b> - Trial court did not err in ruling that the transcript of the hearing on a manufacturer's motion for summary judgment accurately portrayed what had occurred at the hearing because the certification of the transcript met the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-14-5, and a driver had the burden to seek corrective action under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41(f).

<p class="p4">In an appeal of a criminal conviction, the appellate court chose to sua sponte reinstate the case to address the appellant's enumerations of error on the merits despite the failure to set forth in the notice of appeal the intention to rely upon a previously transmitted transcript because the court had not yet addressed the issue in a published opinion and used the case to place future appellants on notice that similar procedural errors may result in automatic affirmance of a trial court's decision.

<p class="p4"><b>Appellant bears burden of timely filing transcript or obtaining extension.</b> - Burden is on appellant to file transcript of evidence within 30 days of filing of notice of appeal, or if transcript cannot be obtained within that time the appellant must obtain an extension of time to file a transcript.

Since no transcript existed, the appellate court was unable to determine whether the security corporation had rebutted the presumption that the filing of the transcript 49 days after the 30-day statutory deadline for filing transcripts was unreasonable and no extension was requested.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred in failing to dismiss the state's appeal because the trial court's findings of fact did not support conclusions of law that the state's delay was neither unreasonable nor inexcusable particularly in light of the state's burden to come forward with evidence to rebut the presumption that the delay was inexcusable when the state far exceeded 30 days and the state failed to request an extension.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all criminal cases, the notice of appeal filed as provided in Code Sections 5-6-37 and 5-6-38 shall serve as supersedeas in all cases where a sentence of death has been imposed or where the defendant is admitted to bail. If the sentence is bailable, the defendant may give bond in an amount prescribed by the presiding judge, with security approved by the clerk, conditioned upon the defendant's personal appearance to abide the final judgment or sentence of the court. If the judgment or sentence is or includes a fine which is unconditionally required to be paid, and is not required to be paid over a period of probation, nor as a condition of a suspended or probated sentence, nor as an alternative sentence, the bond may also be conditioned upon payment of the fine at the time the defendant appears to abide the final judgment or sentence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the defendant is a corporation which has been convicted as provided in Code Section 17-7-92, the presiding judge, on the motion of the defendant, prosecuting attorney, or on its own motion, may order that supersedeas be conditioned upon the posting of a supersedeas bond. Said order may be entered either before or after the filing of a motion for a new trial or notice of appeal. The bond shall be in an amount prescribed by the presiding judge, with security approved by the clerk, conditioned upon the defendant's appearance, by and through a corporate officer, agent, or attorney at law, to satisfy the judgment, together with all costs and interest. If the corporation fails to make the bond as ordered, the prosecuting attorney or other proper officer may use any and all lawful process and procedures available to enforce and collect the judgment. Should final judgment be entered in favor of the defendant, the presiding judge shall order a refund of all amounts collected in satisfaction of the judgment. The State of Georgia, and its political subdivisions, district attorney, solicitor-general, sheriff, marshal, all other proper officers, and all agents and employees of the aforementioned persons shall be immune from all civil liability for acts and attempts to enforce and collect a judgment under this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any supersedeas bond may be reviewed by the presiding judge on the motion of defendant, prosecuting attorney, or on its own motion, and the court may require new or additional security, or order the bond strengthened, increased, reduced, or otherwise amended as justice may reasonably require.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial judge may use discretion</b> in determining if bail should be granted. Sellers v. Georgia, 374 F.2d 84 (5th Cir. 1967). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Granting or refusing of bail in felony cases after indictment and conviction is a matter within sound discretion of trial court, and Supreme Court on appeal will not control that discretion unless that discretion has been flagrantly abused. Watts v. Grimes, 224 Ga. 227, 161 S.E.2d 286 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"If sentence is bailable," means</b> when it is bailable in sound discretion of trial judge. Sellers v. State, 112 Ga. App. 607, 145 S.E.2d 827 (1965); Watts v. Grimes, 224 Ga. 227, 161 S.E.2d 286 (1968); Holcomb v. State, 129 Ga. App. 86, 198 S.E.2d 876 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Continuation of bond until appeal is finally decided.</b> - It would be unrealistic to limit bond to single, specified date and not to require that bond be continued in effect until appeal is finally decided. State v. Slaughter, 246 Ga. 174, 269 S.E.2d 446 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Criminal bonds construed with reasonable strictness.</b> - Criminal bond should be construed with reasonable strictness and surety should not be required to fulfill any conditions the surety did not covenant to perform, but intention as expressed by parties should be enforced. Coweta Bonding Co. v. Carter, 230 Ga. 585, 198 S.E.2d 281 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant has no right to suspend order revoking probationary sentence by giving of bond,</b> since final judgment of conviction terminates any right to supersedeas. Morrison v. State, 126 Ga. App. 565, 191 S.E.2d 449 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power to grant nolle prosequi.</b> - In enacting O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-45, the legislature did not intend to deprive the trial court of the court's power to grant a nolle prosequi of a subsequent indictment after the filing of a notice of appeal from an order denying a plea of former jeopardy. Waters v. State, 174 Ga. App. 438, 330 S.E.2d 177 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power of supersedeas.</b> - Notice of appeal did not serve as a supersedeas and generally divested the trial court of jurisdiction to alter or execute a judgment of conviction since the defendant had not been found guilty of theft by receiving, and thus there was no judgment of conviction to appeal. Reedman v. State, 265 Ga. App. 162, 593 S.E.2d 46 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Considerations for bond.</b> - Release on bond should not be granted unless the court finds that there is no substantial risk the defendant will not appear to answer the judgment following conclusion of the appellate proceedings and that the defendant is not likely to commit a serious crime, intimidate witnesses or otherwise interfere with the administration of justice, and that the appeal is not frivolous or taken for delay. Johnson v. State, 176 Ga. App. 620, 337 S.E.2d 42 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction to reconsider order to return property.</b> - Trial court's jurisdiction to reconsider the court's order to return property, which was removed when the state filed the state's notice of appeal, is not retroactively supplied by the fact that the appeal was later dismissed by order of the supreme court for lack of a right of appeal in the state. King v. State, 208 Ga. App. 623, 432 S.E.2d 109 (1993), aff'd, 264 Ga. 282, 443 S.E.2d 844 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of trial court.</b> - Pendency of an appeal in the Supreme Court of Georgia did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to issue an order granting the defendant an out-of-time appeal. Porter v. State, 308 Ga. App. 121, 706 S.E.2d 620 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a criminal case, the trial court maintains jurisdiction over the injunctive relief granted to the state in cases ordering involuntary medication of a defendant, including any modification or stay of that relief. Either the government or the defendant may move to revise the court's sell order if circumstances change during a defendant's treatment. Johnson v. State, 341 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate court lacked jurisdiction over bail conditions.</b> - Appellate court was without jurisdiction to consider the defendant's arguments regarding bail conditions because under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-45(c), such conditions were reviewable by the trial court.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In civil cases, the notice of appeal filed as provided in Code Sections 5-6-37 and 5-6-38 shall serve as supersedeas upon payment of all costs in the trial court by the appellant and it shall not be necessary that a supersedeas bond or other form of security be filed; provided, however, that upon motion by the appellee, made in the trial court before or after the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, the trial court shall require that supersedeas bond or other form of security be given with such surety and in such amount as the court may require, conditioned for the satisfaction of the judgment in full, together with costs, interest, and damages for delay if the appeal is found to be frivolous. When the judgment is for the recovery of money not otherwise secured, the amount of the bond or other form of security shall be fixed at such sum as will cover the whole amount of the judgment remaining unsatisfied, costs on the appeal, interest, and damages for delay, unless the court after notice and hearing and for good cause shown fixes a lesser amount. When the judgment determines the disposition of the property in controversy as in real actions, trover, and actions to foreclose mortgages and other security instruments, or when such property is in the custody of the sheriff or other levying officer, or when the proceeds of such property or a bond for its value are in the custody or control of the court, the amount of the supersedeas bond or other form of security shall be fixed at such sum only as will secure the amount recovered for the use and detention of the property, the costs of the action, costs on appeal, interest, and damages for delay. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Code section, in any civil case under any legal theory, including cases involving individual, aggregated, class-action, or otherwise joined claims, the amount of supersedeas bond or other form of security to be furnished during the pendency of all appeals or discretionary reviews of any judgment granting legal, equitable, or any other form of relief or damages, including compensatory, special, punitive, exemplary, or other damages, in order to stay execution of the judgment during the entire course of appellate review by any court shall be set in accordance with applicable laws or court rules, but the total supersedeas bond or other form of security that is required of all appellants collectively shall not exceed $25 million regardless of the value of the judgment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If supersedeas bond or other form of security is not filed within the time specified by the judge, or if the bond or other form of security filed is found insufficient, a bond or other form of security may be filed at such time as may be fixed by the trial court. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By entering into an appeal or supersedeas bond or other form of security given pursuant to this Code section, the surety submits himself or herself to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as the surety's agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond may be served. The surety's liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of notice or an independent action. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing in this Code section shall deprive the superior courts of their separate power to grant supersedeas under paragraph (1) of Code Section 15-6-9 nor deprive the appellate courts of the power to grant supersedeas in such manner as they may determine to meet the ends of justice. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If an appellee proves by a preponderance of the evidence that a party bringing an appeal, for whom the supersedeas bond or other form of security has been limited pursuant to subsection (b) of this Code section, is dissipating or secreting its assets, or diverting assets outside the ordinary course of business to avoid payment of a judgment, a court may require the appellant to post a bond or other form of security in an amount not to exceed the total amount of the judgment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment of costs in trial court is prerequisite.</b> - In civil action, filing of notice of appeal does not serve as supersedeas until all costs in the trial court have been paid. Chappelaer v. General G.M.C. Trucks, Inc., 130 Ga. App. 664, 204 S.E.2d 326 (1974); Penny Profit Foods, Inc. v. McMullen, 214 Ga. App. 740, 448 S.E.2d 787 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a civil action, the filing of a notice of appeal does not serve as a supersedeas until all costs in the trial have been paid; when all costs are paid, the trial court loses jurisdiction over the case while the appeal is pending. Duncan v. Ball, 172 Ga. App. 750, 324 S.E.2d 477 (1984); Rockdale Awning &amp; Iron Co. v. Kerbow, 210 Ga. App. 119, 435 S.E.2d 619 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Filing of notice of appeal did not serve as a supersedeas because the appellant failed to pay all costs in the trial court and all costs in the appeals preparation. Lott v. Arrington &amp; Hollowell, P.C., 258 Ga. App. 51, 572 S.E.2d 664 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Notice of appeal did not serve as a supersedeas when all costs had not been paid, and although the appellate courts do not condone a party's failure to respond to the motion to dismiss in the first instance, the trial court was not deprived of jurisdiction to consider and rule on that party's motion to set aside the dismissal. Lunsford v. DeKalb Med. Ctr., Inc., 263 Ga. App. 394, 587 S.E.2d 859 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-46, a notice of appeal, with payment of costs, serves as a supersedeas of the judgment appealed and deprives the trial court of jurisdiction over matters affecting such judgment. In the Interest of W.P.B., 269 Ga. App. 101, 603 S.E.2d 454 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§§</b></span><b> 5-6-34 and </b>5-6-35. - While O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35(h) provides that the filing of an application for appeal shall act as a supersedeas to the extent that a notice of appeal acts as a supersedeas, that section applies only to discretionary appeals. O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(b), which applies to interlocutory appeals, does not so provide, but states that if the appellate court issues an order granting an appeal, the applicant may then timely file a notice of appeal and the notice of appeal shall act as a supersedeas, as provided in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-46. Nelson v. Haugabrook, 282 Ga. App. 399, 638 S.E.2d 840 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hearing not required.</b> - Trial court was not required to conduct an oral hearing before granting a motion to require a supersedeas bond under the statute. Rapps v. Cooke, 234 Ga. App. 131, 505 S.E.2d 566 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant's right to initiate posting of bond.</b> - Subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-46 provides that the appellee shall be entitled to the posting of a supersedeas bond upon the appellee's motion. The statute is silent as to whether the appellant can initiate the posting of bond, but no impediment appears which would legally prevent the appellant from doing so if the appellant wishes. Bank S. v. Roswell Jeep Eagle, Inc., 200 Ga. App. 489, 408 S.E.2d 503 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment determining disposition of property.</b> - In an action by mortgagors against mortgagee and foreclosure sale purchaser to challenge the lawfulness of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, a supersedeas bond was authorized even though no money judgment was entered against the mortgagors. Cloud v. Georgia Cent. Credit Union, 214 Ga. App. 594, 448 S.E.2d 913 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Borrower failed to show that the trial court abused the court's discretion in setting a $300,000 supersedeas bond because the case fell within the disposition-of-property provision of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-46(a); the bank argued that interest continued to accrue on the note securing the loan pending appeal, that taxes on the property were coming due, and that the appeal delayed the bank from pursuing the bank's foreclosure, confirmation, and action for deficiency judgment. Duke Galish, LLC v. SouthCrest Bank, 314 Ga. App. 801, 726 S.E.2d 54 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant proceeding in forma pauperis to be reimbursed for costs.</b> - In the absence of a traverse to the appellant's affidavit, it is error to deny the appellant's motion to proceed in forma pauperis. When such a denial does occur, the appellant must be reimbursed for all costs actually paid by the appellant because of the requirements of subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-43. However, the appellant is not entitled to be reimbursed for attorney's fees incurred during the appellant's appeal. Heath v. McGuire, 167 Ga. App. 489, 306 S.E.2d 741 (1983) (decided prior to 1982 amendment of <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Uniform Superior Court Rule 6.2 does not apply</b> to motions for supersedeas bonds. Cloud v. Georgia Cent. Credit Union, 214 Ga. App. 594, 448 S.E.2d 913 (1994); Rapps v. Cooke, 234 Ga. App. 131, 505 S.E.2d 566 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No jurisdiction to order interim special master fees.</b> - Trial court erred in ordering a property owner to immediately pay the special master fees in a quiet title action as the ultimate responsibility for the fees of the special master was directly related to the resolution of the quiet title action; the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order payment of interim fees to the special master. Davis v. Harpagon Co., LLC, 281 Ga. 250, 637 S.E.2d 1 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No jurisdiction to vacate default judgment.</b> - In an unpaid wages case, a trial court lacked jurisdiction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-46 to grant a former employer's second motion to vacate a default judgment as the employer's petition for certiorari as to the denial of the first motion to set aside was still pending when the order granting the second motion was entered. Guthrie v. Wickes, 295 Ga. App. 892, 673 S.E.2d 523 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Defendants in a RICO action failed to exercise the defendants' right to open a prematurely entered default judgment as a matter of right by filing an answer and costs within the 15-day period provided in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-55(a); instead, the defendants filed an appeal. Although the trial court was thereby divested of jurisdiction to alter or amend the judgment, the defendants still could have opened the default as a matter of right by filing an answer and paying costs. Florez v. State, 311 Ga. App. 378, 715 S.E.2d 782 (2011), cert. dismissed, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 64 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No jurisdiction after appeal filed.</b> - Because a neighbor filed a notice of appeal, the trial court lacked jurisdiction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-46(a) to supplement, amend, alter, or modify an order purporting to dismiss two of the neighbor's complaints with prejudice. McLeod v. Clements, 310 Ga. App. 235, 712 S.E.2d 627 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-46(a), the trial court was without jurisdiction to enter final judgment orders in favor of a bank because the orders were entered after notices of appeal as the summary judgment orders had already been filed. Shropshire v. Alostar Bank of Commerce, 314 Ga. App. 310, 724 S.E.2d 33 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Child custody proceedings.</b> - Trial court did not exceed the court's authority in denying a former husband's motion for supersedeas to enforce an emergency order limiting a former wife's visitation and requiring the visitation to be supervised pending appeal because in the court's order resolving the supersedeas issue the trial court expressly excepted the custody and visitation provisions of the court's prior order from any supersedeas effect; the trial court found that the allegations upon which the emergency order was based were not supported by any credible evidence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of traverse to pauper's affidavit</b> is simply to allow hearing on ability to pay. Hubbard v. Farmers Bank, 153 Ga. App. 497, 265 S.E.2d 845 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of successful traverse of pauper's affidavit.</b> - When appellant's pauper's affidavit is successfully traversed, appellant is required to pay court costs and provide such supersedeas bond as is appropriate to the circumstances, and upon failure to comply therewith authorizes dismissal. Spaulding v. Rich's, Inc., 144 Ga. App. 467, 241 S.E.2d 584 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Finding that party not indigent not reviewable.</b> - Trial court's finding that a party was able to pay the costs of preparing a record is not reviewable even though no opposing affidavit challenging the party's affidavit of indigency was filed. Saylors v. Emory Univ., 187 Ga. App. 460, 370 S.E.2d 625, cert. denied, 187 Ga. App. 908, 370 S.E.2d 625 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ordinarily, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-47(b) and 9-15-2(a)(2), a trial court's findings concerning a party's indigency are not reviewable in cases when the affidavit of indigency has been traversed by an opposing affidavit. Quaterman v. Weiss, 212 Ga. App. 563, 442 S.E.2d 813 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a breach of contract suit brought by an oncologist against a corporation, the corporation's failure to submit an opposing affidavit to the oncologist's pauper's affidavit did not alter the fact that the trial court's findings regarding the oncologist's indigency were not subject to appellate review. Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-47(b) and 9-15-2(a)(2), a trial court's ruling regarding indigency was final and not subject to appellate review; the proper forum for determining the truth of a pauper's affidavit was in the trial court.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Must contain statement that inability to pay is due to poverty.</b> - It is essential to sufficiency of pauper's affidavit that it include statement that inability of affiant to pay costs is "because of his poverty," and, being without such statement, neither affiant as plaintiff in error nor the plaintiff's attorneys will be relieved from payment of costs. Stevens v. Bibb Mfg. Co., 45 Ga. App. 282, 164 S.E. 221 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 6166).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to conduct hearing on prisoner's pauper's affidavit.</b> - Trial court erred by failing to conduct a hearing on a prisoner's claim of indigence as the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-2(b) required a hearing before the court could order costs to be paid and there was nothing in the statute that allowed the court, on the court's own, to inquire into the truth of a pauper's affidavit to order the payment of court costs without a hearing. Lee v. Batchelor, 345 Ga. App. 559, 814 S.E.2d 416 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Emergency motion for supersedeas required.</b> - Claim that a tenant's notice of appeal and affidavit of poverty did not act as a supersedeas of an order issuing a landlord a writ of possession was rejected as it was not a matter reflected in the appellate record and was something that should be handled by an emergency motion for supersedeas; further, the tenant did not file an enumeration of errors and brief and no extension had been requested or granted.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to dismiss appeal.</b> - Trial court's dismissal of an appeal from a summary judgment dismissing a wrongful death claim brought by four children, due to the failure of two of the children to pay costs or submit affidavits of indigency, was in error as to two of the children who filed affidavits of indigency; assuming the children filed true affidavits of indigence (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-2(a)(2), (b)), the children had rights to appeal from the dismissal of the children's proportionate shares of the wrongful death case as: (1) the wrongful death claim was not jointly in all the children or in none of the children; and (2) originally, each child had a separate claim for one-fourth of the value of the decedent's life. Mapp v. We Care Transp. Servs., 314 Ga. App. 391, 724 S.E.2d 790 (2012), cert. denied, No. S12C1111, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 660 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

In like manner, the trial court may order the appeal dismissed where there has been an unreasonable delay in the transmission of the record to the appellate court, and it is seen that the delay was inexcusable and was caused by the failure of a party to pay costs in the trial court or file an affidavit of indigence; provided, however, that no appeal shall be dismissed for failure to pay costs if costs are paid within 20 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) of receipt by the appellant of notice, mailed by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, of the amount of costs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of section discussed.</b> - See Brackett v. Allison, 119 Ga. App. 632, 168 S.E.2d 611 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - Section contains specific and limited grounds for dismissal and is replete with provisions for liberal amendment to meet technical objections to appeals, to the end of facilitating a proper decision on the merits. Munday v. Brissette, 113 Ga. App. 147, 148 S.E.2d 55, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 162, 149 S.E.2d 110 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section opens notice of appeal to extrinsic construction</b> for first time and puts burden on court to examine orders themselves in determining from which orders an appeal has been taken. Brackett v. Allison, 119 Ga. App. 632, 168 S.E.2d 611 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Entire section gives to court a very broad discretion.</b> Brookshire v. J.P. Stevens Co., 133 Ga. App. 97, 210 S.E.2d 46 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate courts should reach merits of appeals when possible.</b> - It is the policy of both appellate courts in Georgia to attempt to avoid dismissing appeals and to try to reach the merits of every case when it can be done consistent with the mandate of the law. Johnson v. Daniel, 135 Ga. App. 926, 219 S.E.2d 579 (1975); Gilland v. Leathers, 141 Ga. App. 680, 234 S.E.2d 338 (1977); Corbin v. First Nat'l Bank, 151 Ga. App. 33, 258 S.E.2d 697 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the plaintiff failed to file enumerations of error as a separate document, but did set forth enumerations of error in the plaintiff's brief, it was apparent from the notice of appeal, the brief, the enumerations of error in that brief, and the record, exactly what judgment was appealed from and what errors were asserted, and a liberal construction of the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30 et seq.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>required the court to exercise the court's discretion to reach the merits of the case. Leslie v. Williams, 235 Ga. App. 657, 510 S.E.2d 130 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section does not limit judicial authority under rule regarding dismissal.</b> - Judicial authority under Rule 39, Rules of the Supreme Court to dismiss appeal for failure to comply with order to file enumeration of error is not prohibited by Ga. L. 1965, p. 18, <span class="s1">§</span> 23 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-30), which expresses an intent to avoid dismissals, and is not limited by the three grounds for dismissal contained in Ga. L. 1968, p. 1072, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2, 3. Taylor v. Columbia County Planning Comm'n, 232 Ga. 155, 205 S.E.2d 287 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Belated filing of separate enumerations of error is not a basis for dismissal of an appeal.</b> Reeder v. GMAC, 235 Ga. App. 617, 510 S.E.2d 337 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to file brief and enumerations of error.</b> - In a suit pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-91-90 et seq., seeking to recover against a payment bond for amounts due for labor and materials provided on a construction project on private property, the court dismissed the subcontractors' appeal because the subcontractors failed to set forth an enumeration of errors as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-40. Complete Wiring Solutions, LLC v. Astra Group, Inc., 335 Ga. App. 723, 781 S.E.2d 597 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former Rule 14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (see Rule 39) is directory</b> and its violation does not constitute one of the limited grounds for dismissal as prescribed by this section. Durham v. Stand-By Labor of Ga., Inc., 230 Ga. 558, 198 S.E.2d 145 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What must be shown to order dismissal.</b> - In order for the trial court to order the dismissal of an appeal, it must appear that the delay between the filing of the notice of appeal and the subsequent filing of the transcript was unreasonable and that the unreasonable delay was inexcusable. Gay v. City of Rome, 157 Ga. App. 368, 277 S.E.2d 741 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion of court.</b> - In passing upon issues of unreasonable delay and inexcusable delay, the trial court has discretion. However, it is a legal discretion which is subject to review in the appellate courts. Gay v. City of Rome, 157 Ga. App. 368, 277 S.E.2d 741 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the main appeal was dismissed in the appeal's entirety and the defendant filed no application for interlocutory review of the denial of the motion to transfer venue, the court had no independent jurisdiction over the cross-appeal and dismissal is proper. Patel v. Georgia Power Co., 234 Ga. App. 141, 505 S.E.2d 787 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Formal recitation of conditions of grant or denial not required.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-41 does not, by the statute's terms, require the trial court to make a formal recitation of the conditions upon which the trial court grants or denies a motion to dismiss an appeal. When the challenged order complies with the requirements of <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-48, the trial court is not required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in the court's order denying the motion to dismiss the appeal. Gay v. City of Rome, 157 Ga. App. 368, 277 S.E.2d 741 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No ground exists for dismissing an appeal based on a special demurrer,</b> - or for that matter any motion, if the motion was not timely filed in the trial court. Kimbrough v. State, 336 Ga. App. 381, 785 S.E.2d 54 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hearing.</b> - There is no conflict between the "opportunity for hearing" on a motion to dismiss, as set forth in subsection (c) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-48, and Uniform Superior Court Rule 6.3, and when there is full opportunity to respond to an opponent's motion to dismiss, the court does not err in granting the motion without an oral hearing. Glen Restaurants, Inc. v. Building 5 Assocs., 189 Ga. App. 327, 375 S.E.2d 492, cert. denied, 189 Ga. App. 912, 375 S.E.2d 492 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">If the plaintiff wishes more than 30 days allowed by court order to deliberate on whether the plaintiff should appeal dismissal of the complaint, the plaintiff's remedy is to apply for an extension of time as provided in Ga. L. 1965, p. 18, <span class="s1">§</span> 6 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-39).

<p class="p4">Judgment complained of by parents was a trial court's finding that the parents' children were deprived pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-2(8)(A), and not a later order ruling that the case was closed; the parents' notice of appeal filed more than three months after the order finding deprivation was untimely, and the appeal was dismissed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inexcusable and unreasonable delay.</b> - Considering the fact that the mistaken designation in the notice of appeal could have been easily discovered if some attention had been paid to the matter, and that the earliest inquiry about the status of the appeal did not occur until several months after the notice of appeal had been filed, the trial court was duly authorized to find that plaintiff's delay was inexcusable and unreasonable. Johnson v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 209 Ga. App. 224, 433 S.E.2d 65 (1993); Lindstrom v. Forsyth County, 221 Ga. App. 581, 472 S.E.2d 106 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a limited liability company (LLC) failed to offer an explanation as to why the company did not hire an attorney, obtain the transcript or take any other steps to pursue the company's appeal for over two and one-half years, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in dismissing the appeal, as the lengthy delay was unreasonable, inexcusable, and caused by the LLC.

<p class="p4"><b>Transcript not designated for inclusion in appellate record.</b> - Trial court erred in dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant for failure to timely file a transcript for inclusion in the record on appeal because the appellant's failure to file a transcript could not be deemed to have caused an unreasonable delay as the appellant's notice of appeal did not designate a transcript for inclusion in the appellate record, and the choice of whether to include a transcript in the appellate record was left to the appellant; thus, the trial court abused the court's discretion in dismissing the appellant's notice of appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Request for transcript was ambiguous.</b> - Appellants used ambiguous language in the appellants' notice of appeal and did not include the statutory language suggested regarding whether or not a transcript was to be sent to the appellate court because, when the appellants filed the notice of appeal, there was a transcript of an earlier summary judgment hearing that was already on file, but the appellants had not filed a transcript of a second summary judgment hearing relevant to the appeal; and it was not clear from the appellants' notice of appeal whether the trial court clerk was to wait for the second transcript or send the record with only the transcript already on file.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to state offense and punishment prescribed.</b> - Deficiencies in the defendant's notice of appeal, which did not state the offense and punishment prescribed, did not justify dismissal of the appeal when the notice did provide the specific case number, style, court and date on which the final judgment appealed from was entered and information contained in the notice, considered in conjunction with even a cursory inspection of the record, would make clear the judgment appealed from, as well as the offense and punishment.

<p class="p4"><b>Error sufficiently "set out separately."</b> - In order to take into account the duty imposed by subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-48, when the enumeration of errors filed in the appellate court identifies the trial court ruling asserted to be error, the error relied upon is sufficiently "set out separately" to require the appellate court to shoulder the court's constitutional responsibility to be a court of review.

<p class="p4"><b>Specific grounds stated for directed verdict must be same ones asserted on appeal.</b> - Enumeration of error in a dispossessory case as to the trial court's failure to direct a verdict on the grounds of the lessor's failure to prove demand for possession cannot be construed to encompass, as error, the later refusal to grant judgment n.o.v. on the basis of the lessee's belatedly raised "complete defense" of payment of rent. The trial court's refusal to direct a verdict cannot be expanded to encompass other defects on appeal, because the specific grounds stated for the directed verdict must be the same ones asserted on appeal.

<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction over cross-appeal.</b> - When an appeal from the denial of a summary judgment motion is filed as a cross-appeal, the appellate jurisdiction over the cross-appeal necessarily arises from the court's jurisdiction over the main appeal from the directly appealable order, and thus the cross-appeal must derive its life from the main appeal.

An appellant's voluntary withdrawal of its direct appeal requires the dismissal of a cross-appeal that has no independent basis for jurisdiction and, to the extent it holds otherwise, MARTA v.

<p class="p4"><b>Appellant not obligated to prepare record.</b> - Oligation of the appellant relates to the transcript, and the obligation for the preparation of the record rests with the clerk. After the appellant has filed a notice of appeal, the appellant's duty as to the record is limited to the payment of costs. When the clerk fails to transmit the record, but there is no indication that this failure is occasioned by the failure of a party to pay costs, the trial court has no discretion to dismiss the appeal.

<p class="p4">Because the defendant's notice of appeal from Stephens County superior court was timely, the defendant's error in confusing the counties in an appeal brief was inconsequential to the disposition of the case; thus, the state's motion to dismiss the appeal was denied. McCroskey v. State, 291 Ga. App. 15, 660 S.E.2d 735 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">District attorney's motion to dismiss the defendant's appeal of a judgment denying the defendant's motion to strike an illegal sentence was denied because a direct appeal from the trial court's ruling was authorized; the defendant was contending that the defendant's sentence was illegal because the sentence was based on an unconstitutional statute, which was a colorable claim that the defendant's sentence imposed was void. Wiggins v. State, 288 Ga. 169, 702 S.E.2d 865 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2906, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1251, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 4005 (U.S. 2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal inappropriate sanction for party's refusal to sign deposition.</b> - Dismissal of a party's appeal is not an appropriate sanction for the party's failure to comply with an order to review and sign a deposition. Gerdes v. Dziewinski, 182 Ga. App. 764, 357 S.E.2d 110 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal proper for delay in ordering transcript.</b> - There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court's dismissal of the appellant's appeal based on the appellant's unreasonable and inexcusable delay in ordering the transcript. Kleber v. Cobb County, 212 Ga. App. 441, 442 S.E.2d 296 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal proper since record didn't include all evidence.</b> - In the pageant organizers' appeal from the trial court's denial of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in the model's action for, inter alia, slander, the case was removed from the appeal docket as the record on appeal did not include all of the evidence presented to the jury. Galardi v. Steele-Inman, 259 Ga. App. 249, 575 S.E.2d 921 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No error in favoring transcript.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying a wife's request that the court reporter's audiotapes be replayed in her presence to establish the accuracy of the certified transcript of the wife's remarks against her recollection thereof because the wife did not show error in the trial court's failure to adopt the wife's recollected version of what transpired during the hearing in favor of the court reporter's certified transcript. Willis v. Willis, 288 Ga. 577, 707 S.E.2d 344 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appeals based on void sentence.</b> - State's motion to dismiss the defendant's appeal was without merit and had to be denied as the defendant was entitled to directly appeal the denial of the defendant's petition attacking the defendant's sentence based on the contention that the sentence was void; however, defendant was unable to show that the sentence was void, and, therefore, the defendant's sentence was permissible. Daniel v. State, 262 Ga. App. 474, 585 S.E.2d 752 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Issue preserved for review.</b> - Claim on appeal that the trial court erred by refusing to consider a request for a nonjury bench trial in a criminal matter was preserved for review despite the fact that the counsel did not state an exception or file an objection to the trial court's ruling, as the "bill of exceptions" requirement was abolished a long time ago pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-49(a); the trial court did not err, as there was no requirement that a defendant be given a nonjury trial upon a request and nothing prevented the trial courts from ensuring that the defendants were given the defendants' constitutional jury trial right pursuant to Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI. Lindo v. State, 278 Ga. App. 228, 628 S.E.2d 665 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section sets out forms for enumerations of error and makes them sufficient</b> without reasons given. Dawson v. Garner, 119 Ga. App. 469, 167 S.E.2d 741 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that notice of appeal is not in form suggested in section is immaterial</b> for reason that section specifically provides that "any other form substantially complying therewith shall be sufficient."

</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>2. Content</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enumeration must identify subject matter of objection.</b> - This section, although allowing enumerations of error in highly abbreviated notice form, at very least requires that subject of objection be identified. DeKalb County v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 156 Ga. App. 253, 274 S.E.2d 649 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Subject matter of objection need be indicated only in a general way.</b> Pinyan v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 113 Ga. App. 130, 147 S.E.2d 452 (1966); MacDonald v. MacDonald, 156 Ga. App. 565, 275 S.E.2d 142 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Errors apparent from notice, record, enumeration or combination thereof.</b> - Where it is apparent from the notice of appeal, the record, the enumerations of error, or any combination of the foregoing, what errors are sought to be asserted upon appeal, the appeal shall be considered notwithstanding that the enumerations of error fail to enumerate clearly the errors sought to be reviewed. Robinson v. State, 210 Ga. App. 278, 435 S.E.2d 718 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where error enumerated is not intelligible in itself the brief must make it so,</b> or court has nothing before it for decision. Pinyan v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 113 Ga. App. 130, 147 S.E.2d 452 (1966); MacDonald v. MacDonald, 156 Ga. App. 565, 275 S.E.2d 142 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since subject matter need be indicated only in most general way, appellate court frequently cannot identify or pass upon contention which appellant seeks to urge as cause for reversal unless made intelligible in brief. Wall v. Rhodes, 112 Ga. App. 572, 145 S.E.2d 756 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language regarding whether or not transcript will be sent was ambiguous.</b> - Appellants used ambiguous language in the appellants' notice of appeal and did not include the statutory language suggested regarding whether or not a transcript was to be sent to the appellate court because, when the appellants filed the notice of appeal, there was a transcript of an earlier summary judgment hearing that was already on file, but the appellants had not filed a transcript of a second summary judgment hearing relevant to the appeal; and it was not clear from the appellants' notice of appeal whether the trial court clerk was to wait for the second transcript or send the record with only the transcript already on file. Webb's Erection, Inc. v. Colonial Pacific Leasing Corporation, 345 Ga. App. 202, 812 S.E.2d 602 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Hazy, yet conforming, enumeration suffices.</b> - MacDonald v. MacDonald, 156 Ga. App. 565, 275 S.E.2d 142 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Raising inadequacy of damages by enumerating general grounds of motion for new trial.</b> - Although good practice would call for enumerating as error the inadequacy of jury's verdict for damages, question of inadequacy is sufficiently raised for consideration by court where overruling of general grounds of a motion for new trial is enumerated as error, and question of inadequacy of verdict is presented and argued in briefs. Kirkman v. Miller, 116 Ga. App. 78, 156 S.E.2d 558 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

L. 2006, p. 379, <span class="s1">§</span> 1/HB 1059, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The General Assembly finds and declares that recidivist sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Many sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and some sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The General Assembly finds that this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. The General Assembly further finds that the high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(1) Incarcerating sexual offenders and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(2) Requiring the registration of sexual offenders, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(3) Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual offenders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(4) Collecting data relative to sexual offenses and sexual offenders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(5) Requiring sexual predators who are released into the community to wear an electronic monitoring system for the rest of their natural life and to pay for such system; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(6) Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"The General Assembly further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual offenders and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual offenders to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual offenders. The General Assembly declares that in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual offenders be registered and that members of the community and the public be notified of a sexual offender's presence. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes. Likewise, the designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from findings by the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board and a court if requested by a sexual offender." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section must be construed strictly against state</b> in allowing appeals under specific conditions provided by General Assembly. State v. Clendinin, 136 Ga. App. 303, 221 S.E.2d 71 (1975), overruled on other grounds, 253 Ga. 287, 319 S.E.2d 864 (1984); State v. McIntyre, 191 Ga. App. 565, 382 S.E.2d 669 (1989); State v. Clark, 191 Ga. App. 923, 382 S.E.2d 670, cert. denied, State v. Clark, 191 Ga. App. 923, 382 S.E.2d 670; State v. Sosebee, 191 Ga. App. 725, 382 S.E.2d 681 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The General Assembly having placed in this section specific conditions upon appeals by state in criminal cases, the Court of Appeals will not by judicial construction extend the right of appeal beyond these instances, especially where intent is expressed to limit state to appeals under this chapter. State v. Hollomon, 132 Ga. App. 304, 208 S.E.2d 167 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State's appeal from grant of motion to suppress.</b> - State's appeal from an order excluding the results of tests for alcohol was properly filed under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(4). State v. Holt, 334 Ga. App. 610, 780 S.E.2d 44 (2015), cert. denied, No. S16C0462, 2016 Ga. LEXIS 179 (Ga. 2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Georgia Supreme Court held that the state may appeal a grant of the defendant's motion to suppress data on electronic devices properly seized during an arrest under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1 (a)(4) because even under a strict construction of <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(4), the state has a direct right of appeal when the trial court grants a pre-trial motion to exclude evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained illegally. State v. Rosenbaum, 305 Ga. 442, 826 S.E.2d 18 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State may appeal directly illegal judgment.</b> - Notwithstanding the provisions of this Code section, the state may appeal directly an illegal judgment. State v. Bilal, 192 Ga. App. 185, 384 S.E.2d 253 (1989); State v. Mohamed, 203 Ga. App. 21, 416 S.E.2d 358 (1992); State v. James, 211 Ga. App. 149, 438 S.E.2d 399 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State is authorized to appeal a void sentence</b> pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(5), and the state's appeals are governed by the same time limitations as those applied to other appellants in criminal cases, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-4. State v. Jones, 265 Ga. App. 493, 594 S.E.2d 706 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the absence of express statutory authority requiring the state to file a motion to amend an improper sentence as a prerequisite to appealing that sentence, the state may appeal directly the sentence imposed by the trial court or file a motion to amend the sentence and then directly appeal the denial thereof, but in any event, the state has 30 days from judgment or from the denial of the motion to amend to file its notice of appeal; however, should the defendant file a motion for new trial, that motion tolls the time within which the state can directly appeal the sentence, and in that case, the state has 30 days from the denial of the motion for new trial to appeal the alleged improper sentence. State v. Jones, 265 Ga. App. 493, 594 S.E.2d 706 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State had no right to appeal from no contest plea.</b> - Trial court's order vacating guilty plea and entering a plea of no contest in its stead was not an order from which the state could appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1. The order at issue merely vacated the defendant's guilty plea and substituted a no contest plea in its place, and the state had no right to appeal from such an order. State v. Hill, 321 Ga. App. 759, 743 S.E.2d 448 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Direct appeal available for denial of bail.</b> - When a defendant's case is at an appellate stage and will not return to a pretrial stage unless and until the Georgia Supreme Court affirms the grant of new trial, during the state's appeal, the defendant's case cannot be considered to be pending in the court below; thus, the denial of a defendant's motion for appeal bond is directly appealable by the defendant. Johnson v. State, 304 Ga. 369, 818 S.E.2d 601 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order compelling return of seized property to defendant.</b> - State could not appeal from order compelling the return of seized property to defendant, where the state stipulated it would not use the property at issue in the trial of the charges pending against defendant, and the state did not challenge the trial court's ruling on defendant's motion to suppress. State v. McIntyre, 191 Ga. App. 565, 382 S.E.2d 669 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State may not appeal grant of new trial.</b> - Where, at the close of the defendant's evidence, the court volunteered that in its opinion the state had failed to prove the criminal trespass charge and that, if the jury returned a verdict of guilty, the court would either "set that judgment aside" or "grant a motion for new trial instantly" if defendant requested one on that basis and, immediately following return of the verdicts, the court stated that it was granting "a new trial" on the criminal trespass charge, the court effectively acquitted defendant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if the order had been a proper grant of new trial, it would not have been appealable by the State, as it is not encompassed in <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1. State v. Seignious, 197 Ga. App. 766, 399 S.E.2d 559 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant properly granted new trial.</b> - Upon the state's appeal pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(7), as amended in 2005, the appeals court found that the defendant was properly granted a new trial based on the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, given counsel's failure to interview any of the state's witnesses, present a viable defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter, and adequately investigate whether the victim's death might have been an accident. State v. McMillon, 283 Ga. App. 671, 642 S.E.2d 343 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After the defendant was found guilty of felony murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting death of the defendant's ex-spouse, the trial court properly exercised the court's discretion to grant the defendant a new trial on the general grounds because the court concluded that the jury's guilty verdicts were decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence and contrary to the principles of justice and equity; and the supreme court would not disturb the first grant of a new trial based on the general grounds unless the trial court abused the court's discretion in granting it and the law and the facts demanded the verdict rendered. State v. Hamilton, 299 Ga. 667, 791 S.E.2d 51 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State could not appeal denial of motion to recuse.</b> - Trial court's order denying the state's motion to recuse the judge in a criminal case was not reviewable pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(9) because the state failed to obtain a certificate of immediate review from the trial court and failed to obtain permission to file an interlocutory appeal from the court as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-2. State v. Osborne, 330 Ga. App. 688, 769 S.E.2d 115 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order striking immaterial allegation of accusation</b> could not be appealed by the state. State v. Phillips, 206 Ga. App. 421, 425 S.E.2d 412 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The state cannot circumvent this section</b> and create avenues for appeal by requesting a trial court convert an adverse evidentiary ruling into a motion to quash the indictment and then appeal the adverse ruling that it requested. State v. Land-O-Sun Dairies, Inc., 204 Ga. App. 485, 419 S.E.2d 743 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A revocation of probation hearing.</b> - Appeal by the state from the grant of probationer's motion to suppress was dismissed since a revocation of probation hearing is not a criminal proceeding for purposes of a direct appeal; jurisdiction would lie upon application only. State v. Wilbanks, 215 Ga. App. 223, 450 S.E.2d 293 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction.</b> - The Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to entertain the state's appeal of a dismissal of a juvenile court petition. In re J.H., 228 Ga. App. 154, 491 S.E.2d 209 (1997). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the state, in the person of the district attorney, attempted to avoid the restrictions in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1 et seq., by attacking by way of mandamus and prohibition an alleged magistrate court policy concerning rulings made in criminal prosecutions, and because the state had no ability to appeal the policy, the trial court erred by considering the state's petition for mandamus and prohibition. Magistrate Court v. Fleming, 284 Ga. 457, 667 S.E.2d 356 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant did not file either a cross-appeal to the state's appeal or a separate notice of appeal regarding the superior court's adverse rulings on the other alleged violations of the statute regarding the presiding judge's allegedly improper questioning of the defendant, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant's allegations of error arising from the superior court's adverse rulings. State v. Nickerson, 324 Ga. App. 576, 749 S.E.2d 768 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Supreme court lacked jurisdiction.</b> - State's appeal of an order granting the defendant's motion for new trial was dismissed because the supreme court lacked jurisdiction to consider the state's appeal; the state had no right to file a direct appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(7). State v. Caffee, 291 Ga. 31, 728 S.E.2d 171 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No jurisdiction to grant extraordinary motion for a new trial.</b> - An extraordinary motion for new trial is not among those statutorily enumerated circumstances in which the state may challenge a judgment in a criminal case, therefore, the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain the state's motion or to grant the requested relief. Moody v. State, 272 Ga. 55, 525 S.E.2d 360 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition.</b> - In an original action brought before the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Court dismissed a petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition filed by a prosecutor regarding a criminal prosecution as the prosecutor was not entitled to use the writs to circumvent the statutory limitations on the state's ability to appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-7-1 and 5-7-2.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State may appeal order dismissing indictment</b> even if order is entered during trial. State v. Williams, 246 Ga. 788, 272 S.E.2d 725 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">State was entitled to appeal directly from the sustaining of defendant's special demurrer, because the sustaining of a special demurrer, the result of which is either to strike from or add to the material allegations of an indictment, is equivalent to sustaining a general demurrer and quashing the indictment. State v. Mendoza, 190 Ga. App. 831, 380 S.E.2d 357 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The state's appeal of an order directing a verdict of acquittal on charges against a defendant for family violence battery and cruelty to children was valid because the order was not based on the merits of the case but rather on the fact that the state could not prove any wrongdoing by the defendant on the date stated within the accusation; thus, the trial court's order was actually a dismissal of the accusation. State v. Swint, 284 Ga. App. 343, 643 S.E.2d 840 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The state was permitted to appeal a judgment of a trial court sustaining defendant's demurrer as, while the hearing transcript showed that the trial court considered granting defendant's motion for a directed verdict, the trial court's ultimate ruling was limited to sustaining the demurrer and, in effect, dismissing the accusation because of how the accusation was worded. When the ruling of the trial court is in substance a dismissal of the indictment, the state may appeal an order dismissing an indictment under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(1). State v. Shabazz, 291 Ga. App. 751, 662 S.E.2d 828 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the state's appeal, it was held that a trial court abused the court's discretion by dismissing an indictment against the defendant charging the defendant with felony theft by taking because the fact that it could take years before the defendant would be able to appear in court due to the defendant's immigration status did not provide any legal basis for dismissing the indictment. State v. Bachan, 321 Ga. App. 712, 742 S.E.2d 526 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of state's appeal under O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 5-6-48(c) upheld.</b> - The trial court properly dismissed the state's appeal from an order barring the defendant's trial on speedy trial grounds, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-48(c), as the order was not the type the state had a right to pursue under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1; moreover, the order was not void, as it was entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. State v. Glover, 281 Ga. 633, 641 S.E.2d 543 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer order was appealable by state.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(1) granted the state the right to appeal in a criminal case from an order transferring a case from the state court to the recorder's court as the order effectively set aside or dismissed the state court accusation against defendant and precluded defendant's prosecution there; defendant's motion to dismiss the state's appeal of the order granting the motion to transfer was denied. State v. Serio, 257 Ga. App. 369, 571 S.E.2d 168 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer order was not appealable by state.</b> - Juvenile court erred in finding that a juvenile case involving armed robbery with a firearm was subject to the transfer provisions delineated in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-30.2 because, under subsection (f) of that section, the transfer provisions did not apply in cases involving armed robbery with a firearm, which were subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the superior court under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-28(b)(2)(A)(vii). However, because the juvenile court had concurrent jurisdiction to enter the judgment due to the state's filing a petition in the juvenile court, the state had no right to appeal from the petition pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(A)(5). In re D. L., 302 Ga. App. 234, 690 S.E.2d 522 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority to dismiss charge.</b> - Where a criminal case was called for trial, the court granted the state's motion for continuance and the case was then reset for trial, and the state was not ready to try the case on that date, the court properly dismissed the charges against the defendant. State v. Grimes, 194 Ga. App. 736, 392 S.E.2d 727 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Trial court's order quashing an indictment based solely on the failure to revise the grand jury list</b> during the time period set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-12-40(a)(1) was reversed, as the statute was not obligatory, but directory in nature, merely suggesting a timetable for grand jury lists to be revised; hence, the trial court's order was reversed. State v. Parlor, 281 Ga. 820, 642 S.E.2d 54 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge improperly dismissed.</b> - Because the defendant's alleged mistake of fact regarding a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon required consideration of facts extrinsic to the accusation to be decided by a jury, the trial court erred in dismissing the charge, sua sponte; moreover, as such dismissal was not an adjudication of guilt, the state could appeal from the same without violating the defendant's double jeopardy rights. State v. Henderson, 283 Ga. App. 111, 640 S.E.2d 686 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">At defendants' probation revocation hearings, a trial court erred when the court dismissed indictments in the three cases-in-chief for unavailability of evidence because the dismissals lacked a legal basis, such as failure to prosecute or due process violations, and thus interfered with the state's right to prosecute criminal cases.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining questions of double jeopardy.</b> - Title 16 contains proscription of double jeopardy beyond that provided for in the United States and Georgia Constitutions. Therefore questions of double jeopardy in Georgia must now be determined under expanded statutory proscriptions: <span class="s1">§§</span> 16-1-6, 16-1-7 and 16-1-8. State v. Warren, 133 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grant of plea in bar upheld.</b> - Trial court did not err by granting the defendant's motion for a plea in bar dismissing the charges of conversion of sales and use taxes, theft by taking, and false swearing against the defendant because the charges were not brought within four years of the dates on which the crimes were allegedly committed as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-3-1.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment reversed.</b> - When a mother and daughter were charged with the murder of the daughter's boyfriend, the judgment sustaining the double jeopardy plea in bar on the basis of insufficient evidence in the first trial was reversed because there was evidence of a common criminal intent, including the women's presence, companionship, and conduct before and immediately after the fatal shooting.

If the defendant in a criminal case files any pretrial motion to exclude evidence on the ground that it was obtained in violation of law, the grant of such a motion may be appealed by the state.

<p class="p4">In a robbery case, the state's direct appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(5) from an order excluding evidence of a similar robbery under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-4-404(b) was accepted because, although the trial court was not required to treat the state's pretrial notice of other crimes evidence as a motion under <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(5), the state complied with the provisions of the statute. An order excluding intrinsic evidence was not appealable because the pretrial notice did not cover intrinsic evidence. State v. Battle, 344 Ga. App. 565, 812 S.E.2d 1 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State appeal not allowed.</b> - Because the state failed to request that the trial court put an oral order of suppression in writing, and show that the trial court refused to do so, it did not have the right to appeal from said order; moreover, while the state could have filed a mandamus petition seeking to require the court to do put the oral order in writing, it did not seek said relief. State v. Morrell, 281 Ga. 152, 635 S.E.2d 716 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a defendant's prosecution for drug possession, the state did not have the right to appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(4) from an oral ruling that suppressed the defendant's statements prior to the defendant's arrest at a stop scene for failure to give Miranda warnings because the transcript did not affirmatively show that the state requested the trial court to put the oral order in written form and that the trial court refused to do so.

<p class="p4"><b>Basis for suppression order.</b> - Paragraph (4) authorizes the state to bring a direct appeal only when the trial court's exclusion of evidence is based upon the determination that the state unlawfully obtained it, and not when the exclusion is based upon some general rule of evidence.

State v. Gosch, 179 Ga. App. 613, 347 S.E.2d 353 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where defendant's pretrial motion did not seek the exclusion of any evidence on the ground that it had been obtained in violation of law, and the exclusion of intoximeter test results was based upon the trial court's finding of a material alteration thereof, paragraph (4) was not authority for the state to bring an appeal.

During the final hearing on the defendant's motion, the trial court refused to allow the state to present evidence to contest the motion as a means of sanctioning the state for prosecutorial conduct that the trial court deemed to be dilatory in nature, and the fact that the trial court was the direct cause of the state's inability to meet the state's burden of showing that the identifications were lawfully obtained in no way divested the court of appeals of jurisdiction to hear its appeal pursuant to <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(4).

<p class="p4">Final order of acquittal of all defendants was vacated because the state's pretrial notice of appeal of an evidentiary ruling was effective and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to try the defendants pending resolution of the appeal; because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to proceed with a trial of the defendants, such proceedings were without legal effect and the directed verdicts of acquittal were void.

<p class="p4"><b>Admission of videotape.</b> - In a prosecution for obstruction of a law enforcement officer and simple battery, suppression of a videotape on the ground that it did not capture the entire encounter between the officer and the defendant was error because the probative value of the videotape was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. State v. Forehand, 246 Ga. App. 590, 542 S.E.2d 110 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Suppression of evidence from sobriety checkpoint authorized.</b> - Appellate court erred by reversing a trial court decision granting the appellant's motion to suppress evidence resulting from a traffic safety checkpoint stop of appellant's vehicle because the checkpoint at which appellant was stopped was unconstitutional since the checkpoint did not meet the case law requirement that supervisory personnel made the decision to implement the checkpoint.

<p class="p4"><b>Suppression of custodial statement evidence upheld.</b> - Appellate court affirmed the trial court's order granting the defendant's motion to suppress the custodial statement made to the detectives because asking to contact a girlfriend so the girlfriend could call the defendant's lawyer was a clear request for an attorney and the detectives should have ceased any further questioning.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State appeal from granting of motion to suppress.</b> - While the state had a right to appeal from the trial court's act of granting defendant's motion to suppress, the trial court's ruling that defendant invoked defendant's right to remain silent was not clearly erroneous as the record showed that defendant shook defendant's head in the negative when the state police investigator asked the defendant, "You don't want to talk about it?" and, thus, the inculpatory statements defendant made in regard to the shooting of another person had to be suppressed.

<p class="p4">Court of Appeals was mistaken when the court concluded that the appeal was subject to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(5) and dismissed the appeal as untimely as the state's appeal from the grant of the defendant's motion to suppress fell under <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(4) and was timely filed within 30 days of that ruling.

<p class="p4"><b>State's appeal from void sentence.</b> - Since the state was authorized to directly appeal from an allegedly void sentence, the state's argument that a trial court erred in failing to allow it to withdraw from a plea agreement was properly before the appellate court.

<p class="p4"><b>State's appeal to grant of new trial to defendant.</b> - In the state's appeal, a trial court erred in granting the defendant a new trial with regard to child sex abuse convictions because the defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel since the two witnesses that were not called by defense counsel were not shown to have been reasonably known to defense counsel.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>State's right of appeal in criminal cases is strictly construed.</b> - The General Assembly having placed in <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1 specific conditions upon appeals by state in criminal cases, Court of Appeals will not by judicial construction extend right of appeal beyond these instances, especially where intent is expressed to limit state to appeals under this chapter. State v. Hollomon, 132 Ga. App. 304, 208 S.E.2d 167 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Upon an appeal by the state from an order granting the defendant a new trial, because the state failed to obtain a certificate of immediate review pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-2, the state's attempted appeal was nugatory and did not activate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Georgia. Accordingly, that appeal was dismissed. State v. Ware, 282 Ga. 676, 653 S.E.2d 21 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a trial court's order denying defendant's special demurrer was not a final order, and because an O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-2 certificate of immediate review was not issued, the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1 to affirm the trial court's order. State v. Outen, 289 Ga. 579, 714 S.E.2d 581 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motion to dismiss accusation not final judgment.</b> - Where defendant was charged with abandoning his two minor children and filed a motion to dismiss the accusation, asserting general grounds, the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss, because defendant did not comply with the interlocutory appeal procedure prescribed by subsection O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(b); the overruling of defendant's motion to dismiss the accusation, leaving the case pending for trial, was not a final judgment from which appeal could be taken, absent a certificate of immediate review. Boyd v. State, 191 Ga. App. 435, 383 S.E.2d 906 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sustaining of motion to suppress evidence illegally seized</b> authorizes direct appeal by state. State v. Smalley, 138 Ga. App. 747, 227 S.E.2d 488 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interlocutory orders.</b> - The enactment of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(b) which changed the method by which interlocutory orders are appealed made no essential modification of the principal effect of this section. State v. Blosfield, 165 Ga. App. 111, 299 S.E.2d 588 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to obtain required certificate.</b> - Because the former version of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-2, which was then in effect, required the state to obtain a certificate within ten days of the entry of an order granting a new trial and the state did not obtain the required certificate, the state did not have a right to file a direct appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(7). State v. Caffee, 291 Ga. 31, 728 S.E.2d 171 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">State's appeal of an order granting the defendant's motion for new trial was dismissed because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-2 required the state to obtain a certificate of immediate review to appeal the entry of the order granting a new trial, but the state did not obtain the required certificate. State v. Caffee, 291 Ga. 31, 728 S.E.2d 171 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court's order denying the state's motion to recuse the judge in a criminal case was not reviewable pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-1(a)(9) because the state failed to obtain a certificate of immediate review from the trial court and failed to obtain permission to file an interlocutory appeal from the court as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-7-2. State v. Osborne, 330 Ga. App. 688, 769 S.E.2d 115 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State may not waive defendant's failure to obtain certificate.</b> - Defendant's failure to obtain the certificate of immediate review of the trial court's judgment notwithstanding a mistrial would result in a dismissal of appeal even where the state would voluntarily waive any objection regarding the departure from the appeal procedure. Blackburn v. State, 169 Ga. App. 498, 314 S.E.2d 244 (1984); State v. Strain, 177 Ga. App. 874, 341 S.E.2d 481 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition.</b> - In an original action brought before the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Court dismissed a petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition filed by a prosecutor regarding a criminal prosecution as the prosecutor was not entitled to use the writs to circumvent the statutory limitations on the State's ability to appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-7-1 and 5-7-2. Howard v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State appeal allowed.</b> - Final order of acquittal of all defendants was vacated because the state's pretrial notice of appeal of an evidentiary ruling was effective and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to try the defendants pending resolution of the appeal; because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to proceed with a trial of the defendants, such proceedings were without legal effect and the directed verdicts of acquittal were void. State v. Brown, 333 Ga. App. 643, 777 S.E.2d 27 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Direct appeal available for denial of bail.</b> - When a defendant's case is at an appellate stage and will not return to a pretrial stage unless and until the Georgia Supreme Court affirms the grant of a new trial, during the state's appeal, the defendant's case cannot be considered to be pending in the court below; thus, the denial of a defendant's motion for appeal bond is directly appealable by the defendant.
