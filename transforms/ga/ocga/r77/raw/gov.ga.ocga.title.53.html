<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of Revised Probate Code.</b> - Subsequently-enacted legislation which stated that if an administrator was not appointed within five years after the death of an intestate, then the estate property would be vested in decedent's heirs, and which did not mention anything about divestment of the estate property, did not apply to prevent the probate court from granting the estate administrator's petition to distribute decedent's property even though the estate administrator was not appointed for nearly four decades after the death of the decedent, as the law in effect at the time the estate administrator was appointed had no time limit for the appointment and the subsequently-enacted legislation did not apply to prohibit the estate administrator from being appointed and distributing the property.

<p class="p6"><b>COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p4">This section modifies former OCGA Sec. 53-4-6.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This section expands the forfeiture provisions to apply not only to the killer's right to take a property interest from the decedent but also to serve as a fiduciary of the decedent's estate or any trust created by the decedent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rule applies only to prevent a killer from receiving benefits from the slain person or serving as a fiduciary and does not affect the distribution of the killer's estate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(See OCGA Sec. 33-25-13, which contains a similar rule relating to the receipt of benefits from a life insurance policy.) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This section applies to situations in which the "killing" is such as would constitute murder, felony murder, or voluntary manslaughter, as described in OCGA Secs. 16-5-1 and 16-5-2. The section does not apply to homicide by vehicle, as defined in OCGA Sec. 40-6-393.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The nature of the killing may be established either by a criminal conviction or a guilty plea or, in a civil proceeding, by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Subsection (b) carries forward the rule of former OCGA Sec. 53-4-6 that the share of the individual who engages in the felonious and intentional killing is distributed as if the killer predeceased the decedent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Additionally, the appointment of personal representatives or trustees will proceed as if the killer had predeceased the decedent. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Subsection (c) clarifies that the descendants of the killer are not precluded from taking from the slain person's estate or serving as personal representative or trustee. However, if the descendants are taking by intestacy in place of the killer, the descendants may not take a greater share of the decedent's estate than the share to which the killer would have been entitled. This subsection prevents unfairness in those circumstances in which the treatment of an individual as having predeceased the decedent would result in a diminution of the shares that other individuals would have received had that individual not been treated as having predeceased the decedent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following example illustrates the application of this rule:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assume that a decedent who dies intestate is survived by a brother who has three children and by the one child of a predeceased sister. Under Code Sec. 53-2-1, the sister's child takes one-half of the estate and the brother takes one-half of the estate. But if the brother (as well as the sister) had predeceased the decedent, the same statute directs that the four nieces and nephews of the decedent would share the estate equally. Consequently, the sister's child's share would be diminished to one-fourth. The last sentence of subsection (b) avoids that result by providing that, if the brother is treated as having predeceased the decedent because he killed the decedent, the brother's children (who are taking in place of the brother) will only take the one-half interest that the brother would have taken. Subsection (c) also reflects the rule that Code Sec. 53-4-64 (the anti-lapse statute) does not apply in cases in which a beneficiary is treated as having predeceased the testator due to the fact that the beneficiary killed the testator unless the individuals who would take as substitute beneficiaries for their "predeceased" parent are also descendants of the testator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Conviction for voluntary manslaughter.</b> - Son's conviction for voluntary manslaughter of his father did not establish that he acted with malice so as to prevent his inheriting from his father's estate, nor was malice established by a prior decision finding the son ineligible to receive life insurance benefits because of the manslaughter conviction.

<p class="p4"><b>Legal fees paid by spouse who killed other spouse.</b> - In an estate administrator's conversion suit against a law firm, the trial court properly granted the law firm summary judgment with regard to the administrator attempting to recover $125,000 in legal fees the decedent's spouse had paid to the law firm as the law firm accepted the fees from the decedent's spouse in good faith since it was not determined until the spouse pled guilty to the homicide that the spouse had killed the decedent. Further, there was no evidence that the spouse did not have title to the money when the money was paid. Levenson v. Word, 294 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>2. Life Insurance Policies</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of section to life insurance policies.</b> - Ga. L. 1959, p. 299, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 suggests that it refers to heritable property owned by the decedent and properly a part of the decedent's estate. While an insured is the owner of a contract of insurance on the insured's own life, this is a different sort of ownership because the insured cannot, unless the insured elects to turn the policy in for the policy's cash surrender value, make the policy's proceeds available to the insured during the insured's lifetime. National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 125 Ga. App. 589, 188 S.E.2d 435 (1972) (decided under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299, <span class="s1">§</span> 1). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The legislative scheme under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 is clear that unless the insured affirmatively indicates that the estate is intended as beneficiary, the policy proceeds go to the beneficiary as against the claims of creditors or personal representatives of the deceased. This is generally true even when no beneficiary is named in the policy, but a statute indicates for whose benefit the proceeds are to be used in such event. National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 125 Ga. App. 589, 188 S.E.2d 435 (1972) (decided under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299, <span class="s1">§</span> 1). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When insured could have changed beneficiary at any time, Ga. L. 1959, p. 299, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 does not prohibit the payment of proceeds from life insurance policies to insured's estate where insured killed the policies' beneficiary and then himself. Willis v. Frazier, 128 Ga. App. 748, 197 S.E.2d 830 (1973) (decided under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>3. Vested Interest</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of section to vested interest.</b> - When wife already had a vested one-half undivided interest in the property with a remainder estate in the other one-half interest, subject to divestiture only if she predeceased the husband, the wife's interest was not forfeited even though she killed her husband. Moore v. Moore, 231 Ga. 232, 201 S.E.2d 133 (1976) (decided under Ga. L. 1959, p. 299, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Ademption is confined to specific legacies.</b> Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 753, 34 S. Ct. 322, 58 L. Ed. 467 (1913); Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Legacy is not a specific legacy, which will be adeemed when it does not bequeath a bond so labeled and sequestered as to be distinguished from another bond of a similar kind; it is a demonstrative legacy and does not fail if the subject matter is not in existence on the death of the testator. Young v. Young, 202 Ga. 694, 44 S.E.2d 659 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a will may reasonably be construed as showing an intention of the testator to bequeath to the six legatees something of the value of $1,000.00 each, and only three bonds remain, the will stating the $1,000.00 payments to be made from bonds, a fair and just execution of the will, as found by the trial court, would be to sell the three bonds and place the proceeds in the general assets and from that fund pay the six legatees $1,000.00 each. Young v. Young, 202 Ga. 694, 44 S.E.2d 659 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Failure by the testator to particularize the $1,000.00 bonds bequeathed to stated children, forbid their being classified as specific legacies, and, consequently they do not fail but are payable as general legacies, $1,000.00 to each legatee, out of the general assets of the estate, including the proceeds from the sale of the three bonds on hand after the payment of debts, if any, and the expenses of administration.

<p class="p4"><b>Determination if transfer is an advance on inheritance.</b> - Summary judgment, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56, was reversed since a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether a transfer of money to the decedent's child before the decedent died was an advancement on the child's inheritance, and whether the child breached the fiduciary duty as a result. Walters v. Stewart, 263 Ga. App. 475, 588 S.E.2d 248 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In cases of intestacy, law favors equal distribution among intestate's heirs.</b> There are only two ways by which the scheme of equality among the heirs may be upset. The first, of course, is by the making of a will on the part of the ancestor providing for a distribution of the ancestor's estate in a manner other than that set forth by law; and, the second is by a valid and binding contract executed between the ancestor and the heir, which clearly shows a meeting of the minds between them acknowledging on the part of the heir receipt in full for the heir's prospective share of the ancestor's estate. Such a contract when entered into is binding and enforceable. Cassedy v. Bland, 99 Ga. App. 34, 107 S.E.2d 697 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Advancement determined by intent of parent at time of transaction.</b> - Deed of gift by a father-in-law to a son-in-law, accepted by the latter, which contains a provision clearly indicating that it was the intention of the grantor that the property so conveyed was to be an advancement to the daughter, the wife of the grantee, is an advancement to the daughter under the terms of the statute, notwithstanding the daughter may have been ignorant, not only of the fact that the deed contained such a provision, but even of the existence of the deed altogether. Ireland v. Dyer, 133 Ga. 851, 67 S.E. 195, 26 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1050, 18 Ann.

<p class="p4">When testator, while acting as guardian for the father of the minor in whose behalf suit was instituted, had advanced to her ward, out of the funds inherited by him, a sum of money with which to buy an aeroplane, and during the interim between his arrival at majority and his death at age 25 there was no evidence of an inclination on his part to require his mother to account for the sum so advanced to him, auditor was authorized to find a ratification on his part, and, to that extent, to deny a recovery against the executor of the testator. Kytle v. Kytle, 180 Ga. 833, 181 S.E. 81 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ademption Rule</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of ademption.</b> - Ademption of a specific legacy is the extinction or withdrawal of it, in consequence of some act of the testator equivalent to its revocation, or clearly indicative of an intention to revoke. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 753, 34 S. Ct. 322, 58 L. Ed. 467 (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ademption is effected by the extinction of the thing or fund bequeathed, or by disposition of it subsequent to the will from which an intention that the legacy should fail is presumed. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 753, 34 S. Ct. 322, 58 L. Ed. 467 (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Term "ademption" is sometimes used as synonymous with satisfaction, but such use is inaccurate, as ademption operates independently of intention in case the specific thing given is, at the testator's death, no longer owned by testator. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 753, 34 S. Ct. 322, 58 L. Ed. 467 (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ademption generally.</b> - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterward become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Thompson v. Long, 202 Ga. 718, 44 S.E.2d 651 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standard for defining a "conveyance"</b> is whether there has occurred a change in the testator's ownership sufficiently radical to manifest, as a matter of law, the testator's intention to revoke the specific devise. The term "conveyance" includes a single transaction by which a testator sells the testator's fee simple title to real estate in return for a security title to the real estate sold. Peacock v. Owens, 244 Ga. 203, 259 S.E.2d 458 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ademption arises upon the conveyance of the specific property covered by the legacy,</b> and rests upon a rule of law independent of any supposed actual intent of the testator; and in the absence of any facts which would bring the case within the exceptions set forth in statute, and in the absence of any provision in the will in contemplation of such a contingency, a trial court properly held that a devise had been wholly adeemed by reason of the conveyance of the realty involved, and since the testator died intestate as to this devise, that the proceeds thereof passed into the residuum of the estate. Thompson v. Long, 202 Ga. 718, 44 S.E.2d 651 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Devise adeemed.</b> - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterwards become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Moncrief v. Shuman, 169 Ga. 217, 150 S.E. 98 (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a testator conveys to a third party specific property devised and the will contains no provision for such a contingency, there can be no inquiry into a testator's intention in adeeming specifically bequeathed property. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Devise held to be adeemed.</b> - When wife devised one-half interest in real estate to husband by specific devise, but did not devise the proceeds of its sale to husband, the specific devise was adeemed by alienation when testator sold the fee simple title in return for a down payment, note, and security title. Powell v. Thorsen, 253 Ga. 572, 322 S.E.2d 261 (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-105).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exceptions</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exceptions to ademption rule.</b> - There are four exceptions to the rule that ademption occurs when a testator conveys to another the specific property bequeathed, those exceptions are: (1) where the testator afterwards becomes possessed of the same property; (2) where the attempt to convey fails; (3) where the testator exchanges the property for other of like character; and (4) where the testator merely changes the investment of a fund bequeathed. Lang v. Vaughn, 137 Ga. 671, 74 S.E. 270, 40 L.R.A. (n.s.) 542, 1913B Ann. Cas. 52 (1912) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817) Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A specific devise is adeemed when, after the execution of the will, the testator "conveys" to another the specific property devised unless one of the following four exceptions applies: reacquisition by the testator; failure of the conveyance; receipt of like property in exchange for the devised property and mere change in the investment of a fund. Peacock v. Owens, 244 Ga. 203, 259 S.E.2d 458 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

(This subsection reflects the rule of ademption by satisfaction that appeared in former OCGA Sec. 53-2-105.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under subsection (b), if the advancement is of a demonstrative or general testamentary gift, the amount of the advancement is charged against any amount the beneficiary is slated to receive under the will.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subsection (c) outlines the traditional "hotchpot" method of taking advancements into account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This method is applied in the case of a beneficiary of a residuary share of the transferor's estate or an heir. The "hotchpot" is calculated by adding to the value of the transferor's residuary or intestate estate the value of all advancements made by the transferor except advancements of demonstrative or general testamentary gifts and satisfactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then each recipient's "distributable share" is determined. If an advancement is less than the recipient's distributable share of the estate, the value of the advancement must be charged against any share the recipient is due to receive. For example, suppose the recipient (R) received an advancement valued at $50,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The transferor dies intestate, survived only by three children (A, B, and R) and with an intestate estate of $250,000. The value of R's advancement will be added back to the value of the estate, bringing the value of the "hotchpot" estate to $300,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under the laws of intestacy, each of the children is due to receive 1/3 of the estate ("distributable shares" of $100,000 each).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, since R has already received $50,000 as an advancement, R's distributable share of $100,000 is charged with the advancement so that R receives only an additional $50,000 from the probate estate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A and B each receive $100,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the recipient's advancement equals or exceeds the value of the recipient's distributable share, then the advancement is ignored and the recipient receives nothing further from the estate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, suppose R received an advancement of $150,000 and the transferor died intestate with an estate of $180,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hotchpot estate would equal $330,000 ($180,000 + $150,000), thus entitling each heir to a "distributable share" of $110,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, since R has already received $150,000, the value of the advancement is not brought into the hotchpot estate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>R receives nothing further from the estate, and A and B split the $180,000 estate evenly between themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>In cases of intestacy, law favors equal distribution among intestate's heirs.</b> - In an accounting under this statute when the main object of the litigation is to ascertain and settle authoritatively the amount which each distributee has been advanced by the intestate, the verdict should find the several amounts specifically. The law, and not the jury, determines whether advancements shall be accounted for. Andrews v. Halliday, 63 Ga. 263 (1879) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2582). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There are only two ways by which the scheme of equality among the heirs may be upset. The first, of course, is by the making of a will on the part of the ancestor providing for a distribution of the ancestor's estate in a manner other than that set forth by law; and, the second is by a valid and binding contract executed between the ancestor and the heir which clearly shows a meeting of the minds between them acknowledging on the part of the heir receipt in full for the heir's prospective share of the ancestor's estate. Such a contract when entered into is binding and enforceable. Cassedy v. Bland, 99 Ga.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For purposes of this Code section, the term "property" includes any interest in property and any power over or right with respect to the property. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A person may renounce even if a spendthrift or similar restriction applies to the property renounced. Persons who may renounce include fiduciaries acting on behalf of an individual, such as personal representatives, trustees, conservators, or guardians, as well as duly authorized attorneys in fact, whether acting on behalf of an individual or fiduciary. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A renunciation must be made by a written instrument that describes the renounced property, declares the renunciation and the extent of it, and is signed by the person making the renunciation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The written instrument must be received by the transferor of the property, the transferor's legal representative, or other holder of title to the property not later than the date which is nine months after the later of: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">The instrument may also be filed in the probate court of the county in which proceedings concerning the transferor's estate are pending or in which they could be commenced and, in the case of real property, in the real property records of the county in which the real property is located. An instrument so filed in the probate court shall be conclusively presumed to have been received by the personal representative of the transferor's estate not later than the date of such filing, but earlier receipt may be shown. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A will or other governing instrument may otherwise provide expressly or by implication, but the fact that a remainder or other future interest following a renounced interest is conditioned upon surviving the holder of such renounced interest shall not, without more, be sufficient to indicate that such conditioned interest should not accelerate by reason of such renunciation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, solely for the purposes of the proviso of paragraph (5) and the proviso of paragraph (7) of subsection (c) of Code Section 53-2-1, any individual renouncing who is the only sibling or the only aunt or uncle surviving the decedent shall not be deemed to have predeceased the decedent. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(g)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In every case a renunciation relates back for all purposes to the applicable date among the following: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Any renunciation that is otherwise valid but fails to meet the requirements of subsections (c) and (d) of this Code section shall operate as a transfer of the property to those persons who would have received it had the renunciation met those requirements. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(i)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing in this Code section alters the duties of any fiduciary to act in the best interests of the person the fiduciary represents.

<p class="p6"><b>COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p4">This subsection replaces former OCGA Sec. 53-2-115.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The section mirrors the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 2518 and related United States Treasury Regulations. The section is not intended to preempt other common law or statutory forms of renunciation but rather to provide a mechanism whereby persons may make renunciations that constitute "qualified disclaimers" under that Internal Revenue Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-115 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Term "encumbrance" in paragraph (d)(1)</b> of former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-115 referred to an encumbrance placed on the property by the disclaimant, not an encumbrance existing at the time of the decedent's death. Brown v. Momar, Inc., 201 Ga. App. 542, 411 S.E.2d 718 (1991) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-115).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Acceptance".</b> - Heir's acceptance of $460 from decedent's accounts for use in purchasing personal clothing did not constitute the type of "acceptance" sufficient to preclude the heir's timely renunciation of the heir's testamentary interest. Jordan v. Trower, 208 Ga. App. 552, 431 S.E.2d 160 (1993) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-115).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceleration "otherwise indicated" by testator.</b> - When, under the will, no wife or child of the testator's sons would have the right of possession to trust property prior to the death of the sons, the inter vivos renunciation of their immediate interests by the sons did not accelerate the remainder interests. Wetherbee v. First State Bank &amp; Trust Co., 266 Ga. 364, 466 S.E.2d 835 (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-115).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceleration prohibited when class could not be ascertained.</b> - Trust agreement prohibited acceleration when the class of remaindermen consisted of living grandchildren of the settlor and beneficiary, so that the class could not be ascertained until the death of the settlor's and beneficiary's last child. Linkous v. Candler, 270 Ga. 284, 508 S.E.2d 657 (1998) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-115).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of renunciation on Medicaid benefits.</b> - While a Medicaid claimant was entitled under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-1-20 to renounce an inheritance under the will of the claimant's spouse, this did not insulate that choice from the application of Medicaid's eligibility regulations. Thus, the Georgia Department of Community Health properly denied Medicaid vendor benefits to the claimant. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Medders, 292 Ga. App. 439, 664 S.E.2d 832 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-1-20(g), a beneficiary's renunciation of a devise or bequest relates back to the date of death. However, nothing in <span class="s1">§</span> 53-1-20 requires the Georgia Department of Community Health to ignore the date a Medicaid claimant files a renunciation in applying its transfer-of-resource policies. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Medders, 292 Ga. App. 439, 664 S.E.2d 832 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Posthumous child qualified as decedent's child.</b> - Decedent's posthumous, out-of-wedlock child was entitled to pursue a wrongful death claim under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-4-2 to the exclusion of the decedent's parents. Under the statute pertaining to descent and distribution, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-1(a)(1), the posthumous child qualified as the decedent's child and to ignore the laws of descent and distribution would run counter to the essence of a wrongful death claim; simply because the decedent's parents wished to share in any award did not render an inequitable result in light of the priority ordinarily given to children by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 19-7-1(c)(2). deVente v.

<p class="p4"><b>Must be an interested person to have standing to offer will to probate.</b> - Trial court erred by denying two children's motion to dismiss the petition to probate filed by the decedent's brother because the brother lacked standing to offer the will to probate under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2 because the brother was not an interested person as the brother was not a judgment creditor of an heir of the decedent, a purchaser from an heir, a person claiming under an earlier will, or an administrator appointed for the decedent before discovery of the will.

<p class="p4"><b>Impact of parent's cruel treatment of decedent's child.</b> - Despite evidence of a parent's cruel treatment of the parent's decedent child, the trial court erred in finding that the parent forfeited parental rights, and thus lost the status as a parent and, in so doing, lost the right to recover as an heir of the decedent's estate, as the loss of parental power did not necessarily result in a parent's loss of a right to inherit as an heir from the estate of that parent's child, short of having the parent's rights terminated prior to the child's death; hence, summary judgment against the parent on the issue was reversed.

<p class="p11">(ii) A court of competent jurisdiction has otherwise entered a court order establishing paternity; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(B) (i) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph notwithstanding, a child born out of wedlock may inherit from or through the father, other children of the father, or any paternal kin by reason of the paternal kinship if evidence of the rebuttable presumption of paternity described in this subparagraph is filed with the court before which proceedings on the estate are pending and the presumption is not overcome to the satisfaction of the trier of fact by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(ii) There shall exist a rebuttable presumption of paternity of a child born out of wedlock if parentage-determination genetic testing establishes at least a 97 percent probability of paternity.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 1800, former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3029, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Georgia's pre-1980 intestacy scheme concerning illegitimate children (formerly Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-904) was unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because the statute excluded significant categories of illegitimates whose inheritance rights could be recognized without jeopardizing the orderly administration of estates. Poulos v. McMahan, 250 Ga. 354, 297 S.E.2d 451 (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4); Hill v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient evidence of right to inherit.</b> - Right to inherit under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-3 was established notwithstanding the fact that decedent never took steps to legitimate petitioner where decedent acknowledged petitioner as his biological child and acknowledged petitioner's son as his grandchild. There was a rebuttable presumption that the man who was married to claimant's mother at the time of claimant's birth was the biological father. In re Estate of Slaughter, 246 Ga. App. 314, 540 S.E.2d 269 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Born-out-of-wedlock claimant was entitled to a rebuttable presumption under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-3(2)(B) that a decedent was the claimant's father, and that the claimant was entitled to inherit from the estate because the claimant produced parentage-determinative genetic testing, which established at least a 97% probability that the decedent was the claimant's father.

Sardy v. Hodge, 264 Ga. 548, 448 S.E.2d 355 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1191, 115 S. Ct. 1255, 131 L.

<p class="p4"><b>"Clear and convincing,"</b> as applied to evidence under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4, is a more stringent standard than "preponderating" and requires a greater quantum and high quality of proof in plaintiff's favor.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of doctrine of virtual legitimation.</b> - Doctrine of virtual or equitable legitimation will allow an illegitimate child to inherit from the child's intestate father's estate when the evidence is clear and convincing. Prince v. Black, 256 Ga. 79, 344 S.E.2d 411 (1986), rev'g, 176 Ga. App. 465, 336 S.E.2d 318 (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Child born out of wedlock is not required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child's natural father intended the child to share in his estate as prescribed by the rules of descent and distribution, just that he intended that the child take from his estate. Varner v. Sharp, 219 Ga. App. 125, 464 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a child born out of wedlock does prove that decedent was the child's father and that he intended for the child to take from the estate, the court must determine, based upon the rules of intestate succession, the amount to which the child is entitled; the burden of proving such amount does not rest with the child. Varner v. Sharp, 219 Ga. App. 125, 464 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of virtual legitimation applied.</b> - When decedent's actions indicated that decedent was in the process of taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the child whom he and his cohabitant had conceived would be born into a legitimate family environment, and everything necessary for his divorce from his estranged wife was complete except for the final decree, there was clear and convincing evidence that decedent intended for his unborn child to be born into a legitimate family environment, and his unexpected death would not defeat the claim of the child, who could inherit under the doctrine of virtual legitimation. Simpson v. King, 259 Ga. 420, 383 S.E.2d 120 (1989) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of virtual legitimation not applied retroactively.</b> - Alleged illegitimate children were not entitled to inherit from father's estate since the children could not produce an order establishing parentage, and the doctrine of virtual legitimation did not apply since inheritance had been settled. Tolbert v. Whatley, 223 Ga. App. 508, 478 S.E.2d 587 (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Only illegitimate child through maternal line obtained interest in property.</b> - When the owner of a tract of land died in 1926 and the owner's sole surviving heirs were a nephew and niece who died in 1942 and 1947, respectively, each of whom was survived by an illegitimate son, the son of the niece inherited sole title to the property through the maternal line of descent, although he and the son of the nephew have since operated under the assumption that they were co-owners. Carter v. Becton, 250 Ga. 617, 300 S.E.2d 152 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Estate administrator had right to inspect.</b> - Order granting an estate administrator of a deceased shareholder the right to inspect the defendant's corporate books and denying the defendant's motions to compel and stay pending arbitration was affirmed because the statutes governing the transfer of stock to the estate vested ownership of the shares in the administrator of the estate and the probate court's order granted the adminstrator trustee's powers over those shares.

<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of administrator.</b> - Subsequently-enacted legislation which stated that if an administrator was not appointed within five years after the death of an intestate, then the estate property would be vested in decedent's heirs and did not mention anything about divestment of the estate property did not apply to prevent the probate court from granting the estate administrator's petition to distribute decedent's property even though the estate administrator was not appointed for nearly four decades after the death of the decedent as the law in effect at the time the estate administrator was appointed had no time limit for the appointment and the subsequently-enacted legislation did not apply to prohibit the estate administrator from being appointed and distributing the property.

Because under Georgia law, the appointment of an administrator divested the heirs of their ownership interests directly in the property, a petition for appointment of an administrator was an act to obtain possession of property of the estate in violation of the automatic stay and, further, because it was commenced against the debtor as an heir of the estate, it violated the stay as the commencement of a judicial proceeding against the debtor.

<p class="p4"><b>Best method of proving that no administration was ever had upon a particular estate</b> is to introduce the evidence of the ordinary (now judge of probate court), or of another who has examined the records in the court of ordinary (now probate court) where letters of administration should have been granted, that no such letters are shown by those records.

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right of administrator to recover lands held by heirs for payment of debts.</b> - Heirs at law are entitled to the possession of lands owned by an intestate at the time of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>death, until those lands are needed for the purpose of administration; that is, when necessary, the administrator has a qualified right thereto to pay debts and to make legal distribution. Smith v. Fischer, 52 Ga. App. 598, 184 S.E. 406 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While an heir may bring an action to recover property of an intestate when there is no administrator, or when the administrator consents to the action, the law plainly gives the administrator the right to recover property held adversely to the estate of an intestate. Andrews v. Walden, 208 Ga. 340, 66 S.E.2d 801 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an administrator sues for land, the administrator makes out a prima facie case for the land's recovery upon proof that the administrator's intestate died seized thereof, and that the estate owes debts, which makes it necessary for the personal representative to administer the land for the payment thereof, the administrator having obtained leave to sell the land, and such prima facie case, the suit being against the heirs at law of a deceased son of the intestate, is not overcome by evidence that the deceased son had made declarations that in his lifetime there had been between the heirs a division in kind of the lands formerly owned by the intestate and that the portion sued for had by such division been set apart to him. Hortman v. Vissage, 193 Ga. 596, 19 S.E.2d 523 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Administrator, who was also estate creditor, still had to publish notice of proposed sale.</b> - Trial court properly denied an estate administrator's petition for leave to recover and sell the estate's property as the administrator failed to publish notice of the petition and proposed sale, as required by former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-23, and personal service on the heirs in another proceeding to recover the real property did not satisfy the publication requirement. Huggins v. Powell, 293 Ga. App. 436, 667 S.E.2d 219 (2008) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-10).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof required to defeat right of administrator to recover land for distribution.</b> - In order to defeat the right of an administrator to recover the land for distribution, it is necessary for the heir in possession not only to show that the land can be divided in kind, but that it is the purpose and intention and desire of all the heirs that the land shall be so divided. Jones v. Wilson, 227 Ga. 360, 180 S.E.2d 727 (1971) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>2. Order of Sale</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application for order of sale must allege necessity.</b> - When an administrator applies for leave to sell the land of an intestate, it is essential that the administrator should allege that the sale is necessary for the purpose either of paying debts or making distribution; the ordinary (now judge of probate court) has no authority whatever to grant an administrator leave to sell land, unless it is necessary for one or the other of these purposes. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order authorizing sale by administrator as conclusive proof of necessity of sale.</b> - Order granting leave to the administrator to sell the lot on which the dwelling was located is conclusive on the defendants as to the necessity of such sale by the administrator. City of Griffin v. McKneely, 101 Ga. App. 811, 115 S.E.2d 463 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order of sale not binding upon heir unless personal notice given.</b> - Such an order for sale or distribution is not "conclusive evidence of either fact" unless personal notice has been given an heir in possession. Jones v. Wilson, 227 Ga. 360, 180 S.E.2d 727 (1971) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When it is sought to use the order as conclusive evidence against the heir in such a proceeding, the heir is entitled, under the statute as construed by this court, to personal notice of the application. Unless this character of notice is given, the court is without jurisdiction to render a conclusive judgment, and the heir is at liberty to attack the judgment. The order is, however, in any event prima facie evidence against the heir. But the prima facie showing made against the heir by the order may be overcome, in a proper case, by any competent evidence showing that there is no necessity for a sale. Jones v. Wilson, 227 Ga. 360, 180 S.E.2d 727 (1971) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Administrator liable for rents accruing after grant of order to sell.</b> - When an administrator is granted leave to sell the land of the estate for the purpose of paying debts and distribution, the administrator may collect rents accruing afterwards, and the administrator and the administrator's sureties may be held liable therefor on the administrator's bond. Whether the same would be true as to rents accruing after the intestate's death, but before the order granting leave to sell, it does not appear that rents for any such period would be involved. Jones v. Wilson, 195 Ga. 310, 24 S.E.2d 34 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Two features of former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 113-1018 were especially to be noted:</b> (1) the application may be made by the "representative" of the estate - it is clearly intended to embrace executors as well as administrators; and (2) the statute contemplates a proceeding for the distribution of the estate.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under Laws 1812, Cobb's 1851 Digest, p. 292, Code 1863, <span class="s1">§</span> 2542, Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2543, Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2584, Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2584, Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3479, Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4057, Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-11 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sections which carry provisions into effect.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 1019 and 1020 provided the machinery for carrying into effect the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Two features of former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 113-1018 were especially to be noted:</b> (1) the application may be made by the "representative" of the estate - it is clearly intended to embrace executors as well as administrators; and (2) the statute contemplates a proceeding for the distribution of the estate. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This statutory proceeding is really a legal substitute for the final division</b> and final settlement of accounts by an administrator or an executor. It constitutes the last step in winding up an estate with the stamp of judicial approval on the distribution of the estate as made by the representative. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distribution in kind.</b> - A proceeding under this statute differs from a final approval and settlement of an administrator's account after the division of an estate only in that the statute permits the delivery of the assets in kind and relieves the administrator from the necessity of reducing the assets to the form of cash. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If it was practicable, the ordinary (now probate judge) can order a distribution in kind on the application of the administrator or any distributee of the estate provided all the distributees should agree to such a division; for any one of them would have the right to insist upon a sale of the estate and a distribution of the proceeds. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment of probate court presumed fair and competent.</b> - Probate court by express statute being clothed with jurisdiction generally to divide the property of decedents in kind, and being a court of original and competent jurisdiction for that purpose, it must be conclusively presumed that the court had before it all necessary and competent evidence to authorize the judgment. In these circumstances, the courts are always extremely loath to enter upon an investigation de novo. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equitable claims between cotenants.</b> - Probate court is without jurisdiction to resolve a dispute which involves equitable claims asserted by cotenants. Evans v. Little, 246 Ga. 219, 271 S.E.2d 138 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of superior court to interpret will.</b> - Though it is the rule that a direct proceeding to construe a will must be brought in a court of equity, when the construction of a will is incidentally involved in a proceeding over which the probate court has jurisdiction, this court has jurisdiction under such conditions to interpret the will so far as may be necessary in the proceeding before it. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where devisee brings equitable petition against coexecutors of an estate seeking a partition of the property of the estate through a sale by the receiver, and alleging that more than 20 years had elapsed since the executors had qualified, that all the debts of the estate had been paid, and that executors were in possession of all real and personal property belonging to the estate, the allegations are insufficient to authorize the grant of the prayers for equitable petition between the devisees because plaintiff devisee has a full and adequate remedy under the law in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to require executors to distribute the estate by division or partition. Salter v. Salter, 209 Ga. 511, 74 S.E.2d 241 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Exercise by the superior court of the court's equity jurisdiction in order to fully and adequately resolve all issues between tenants in common would not be an interference with the orderly administration of an estate. Evans v. Little, 246 Ga. 219, 271 S.E.2d 138 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Partition action by tenant.</b> - Existence or nonexistence of administration of the estate does not preclude the bringing of a partition action by a tenant in common. Evans v. Little, 246 Ga. 219, 271 S.E.2d 138 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of order of probate court setting apart portion of estate to beneficiary.</b> - An order of the probate court, setting apart a given portion to a beneficiary necessarily constitutes a double-barreled adjudication that such beneficiary is entitled to the amount of property awarded, and that the beneficiary is not entitled to more than that awarded the beneficiary. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">When parties holding as heirs an undivided interest in lands have abandoned, without formally dismissing, a proceeding instituted in the superior court for partition, and agreed among themselves to institute such a proceeding in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to bring about a partition of the same lands, and this is done by appropriate proceeding in that court, resulting in a judgment confining the assignment of the various parcels by the appraisers, no objection being filed or appeal taken, they are bound by such judgment. They will not subsequently be permitted to disregard such judgment, and seek, by amendment to the original petition in superior court, another partitioning of such lands. Zeagler v. Zeagler, 192 Ga. 453, 15 S.E.2d 478 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1020). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Former O.C.G.A.

Adams v. Adams, 249 Ga. 477, 291 S.E.2d 518 (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose.</b> - Prime purpose of this statute is to provide a suitable support and maintenance for the widow and minor children, if any, of a father who has died. The state gives the year's support a priority over all debts, even though reduced to judgment, and a priority over the taxes due the sovereign state. Beddingfield v. Old Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 175 Ga. 172, 165 S.E. 61 (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute has for its purpose the joint support and maintenance of the widow and the minor children. It is based on considerations of public policy; and as the provisions of the statutes in reference thereto are to be construed in favor of the beneficiaries entitled to support, proceedings thereunder are to be construed in favor of the intended beneficiaries of the law. Farmers Bank v. Williams, 188 Ga. 789, 5 S.E.2d 195 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002); Ennis v. Ennis, 207 Ga. 665, 63 S.E.2d 887 (1951);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Beneficent purpose of the provision for a year's support is to see that the widow and minor children, upon the death of the husband and father, shall not be cut adrift, but shall have immediate relief by having set apart funds or property to carry them through the period of a year, taking into consideration the circumstances and standing of the family previous to the death of the husband, and also keeping in view the solvency of the estate. Tilley v. King, 193 Ga. 602, 19 S.E.2d 281 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purpose of this statute is to provide a support for a limited period for those members of the family whom the deceased was, while in life, legally bound to support. Woodes v. Morris, 247 Ga. 771, 279 S.E.2d 704 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An award entered after the 1979 amendment</b> of year's support statute, but from an estate of a decedent who died before the amendment, is valid. Lawrence v. Lawrence, 254 Ga. 692, 333 S.E.2d 610 (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When property is set apart to a widow and the widow's minor children</b> the property is intended to be used for their joint support and maintenance. Tribble v. Knight, 238 Ga. 84, 231 S.E.2d 68 (1976) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Entitlement to a year's support award is a matter of status,</b> and is established by demonstrating that the applicant belongs within one of the classes of intended beneficiaries codified in subsection (b) of former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2. Gentry v. Black, 256 Ga. 569, 351 S.E.2d 188 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2); Driskell v. Crisler, 237 Ga. App. 408, 515 S.E.2d 416 (1999);(decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When one establishes that he or she is the spouse of the deceased, eligibility for year's support is also established. Gentry v. Black, 256 Ga. 569, 351 S.E.2d 188 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Entitlement to the right to a year's support is a matter of status.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It vests upon the death of the spouse. Wigley v. Hambrick, 193 Ga. App. 903, 389 S.E.2d 763 (1989), cert. denied, 193 Ga. App. 911, 389 S.E.2d 763 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Year's support is designed to care for widow during the first year</b> following her husband's death. Davis v. Birdsong, 275 F.2d 113 (5th Cir. 1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Award of property continues after the expiration of the year,</b> so long as the property lasts, to be used for the support of the widow during her life and the children until the children are married or reach majority. Tribble v. Knight, 238 Ga. 84, 231 S.E.2d 68 (1976) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Personal items from the marital residence.</b> - Genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether certain personal items the executor demanded to be returned from a decedent's widow were taken from the marital residence and were thus included in the year's support awarded to the widow, making summary judgment improper. Rabun v. Rabun, 341 Ga. App. 878, 802 S.E.2d 296 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support reflects public policy.</b> - Law does not require that a father provide for the support of his children after his death. Public policy, of course, favors the support of minor children by the father's estate after his death. Russell v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 247 Ga. 556, 276 S.E.2d 641, overruled on other grounds, Dolvin v. Dolvin, 248 Ga. 439, 284 S.E.2d 254 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">A year's support is an anomaly and special favorite of legislation and jurisprudence. Rimes v. Graham, 199 Ga. 406, 34 S.E.2d 443 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Policy of the law is to protect this favored creature of the law</b> and preserve the property or money set aside as a year's support for that purpose and none other. Rimes v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hinge upon which right of year's support hangs</b> is legal obligation to support during lifetime of deceased. The granting of a year's support is an extension of that obligation beyond the life of the person so obligated, thereby creating a debt of the estate as a necessary expense of administration. Woodes v. Morris, 247 Ga. 771, 279 S.E.2d 704 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Statutes to be construed liberally.</b> - Statutes providing for a year's support and fixing its priority are to be construed liberally in favor of the dependents. Olmstead v.

<p class="p4"><b>Solvency of estate immaterial.</b> - Year's support provided for by statute will be allowed whether the decedent's estate is solvent or insolvent. Hopkins v.

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of application of year's support upheld.</b> - Summary judgment in favor of a caveator, and against a wife, on the wife's application for year's support from the estate of the wife's decedent husband was properly denied as the wife opted instead to accept a $5,000 bequest from the husband's will in lieu of a year's support under a prenuptial agreement which was found to be valid, binding, and enforceable, and the wife failed to show any evidence of duress, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, unconscionability, or changed circumstances which would have voided the agreement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Arbitrary exclusion of minor children from application prohibited.</b> - To arbitrarily discriminate against the minor child under the application for 12 months' support, and so set apart to the widow the entire assets of an insolvent estate, is such as to render such action nugatory and void; and a judgment based on such action is void as a matter of law.

<p class="p4">When the appraisers assumed that it was not compulsory on them to set aside any portion of the estate for the benefit of the minor, who was, so far as the record shows, more dependent upon his father's estate for support and maintenance than the widow who received the entire net amount of the insolvent estate, the appraisers acted under a mistake of law causing the judgment thereby obtained to be set aside.

<p class="p4"><b>Year's support may not attach to alienated property.</b> - Widow is not entitled to have a year's support set apart in land to which the husband during his lifetime conveyed all his title, since such year's support can only be set aside from property of the estate of the husband.

<p class="p4">A judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) allowing a year's support for the family of deceased will not attach to property which has been conveyed away by the deceased prior to his death and is no longer a part of his estate; the rule is the same as applied to the legal title, although the property was conveyed as security only.

Children attaining majority or ceasing by marriage to be of the family, cannot, during that time coerce partition of land thus allowed and set apart, the whole land being charged with the support of the family.

<p class="p4"><b>Disposition of unconsumed property upon death of widow.</b> - Because the statute expressly states that the year's support for the family may be set aside on the application of the widow, when it is set aside, the provision so made inures to the benefit of the class named in the statute. Accordingly, a widow and three children, who are unmarried minors and members of the family at the time of their father's death, are vested with an undivided one-fourth interest each in the lands set apart under the year's support; and the interest which minors take under a year's support is not divested upon reaching majority; and after the widow's death such children are entitled to their proportionate interest in the unconsumed property; and the proportionate interest of the widow under the year's support goes to her heirs at law upon her death intestate.

<p class="p4"><b>Annulment of subsequent remarriage.</b> - When wife died in 1982, husband remarried in 1984, husband petitioned for a year's support from estate of deceased former wife's estate, and then husband obtained decree of annulment of second marriage, the trial court erred in excluding from evidence the marriage certificate and the proffered testimony concerning the nature of the actual relationship between petitioner for a year's support and the second woman, since given the financial benefits which petitioner and the woman stood to achieve after the caveat was filed by having their marriage annulled, a manifest injustice could result if caveators were not permitted to go behind the annulment decree in an attempt to prove that the couple had in fact cohabitated as man and wife both before and after the entry of the annulment decree.

Having no right to any benefit obtained by the mother, plaintiff was not represented by her or bound by her acts. Therefore, while the other children of the decedent father were so bound, she was not estopped or precluded from attacking the validity of the proceedings. Jones v.

<p class="p4"><b>Testamentary provision in lieu of year's support must be clearly expressed.</b> - In case of testacy, in order to put the widow to an election between the provisions made in her favor in the will and her right to a year's support, such testamentary provision in her favor must be either expressly made in lieu of a year's support, or the intention of the testator to that effect must be deduced by clear and manifest implication from the will, founded on the fact that the claim of year's support would be inconsistent with the will or so repugnant to its provisions as necessarily to defeat them. Chambliss v. Bolton, 146 Ga. 734, 92 S.E. 204 (1917) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4045); Clark v. Clark, 62 Ga. App. 738, 9 S.E.2d 710 (1940); Bowen v.

<p class="p4">Widow's claim for a year's support is not barred by accepting provisions made for her in her husband's will when the will does not show a plain and manifest intention on the part of the testator that the provisions made for the wife should be in lieu of a year's support, although the will provides that the executors conduct certain farming operations and pay the profits thereof to the wife, and that his property be kept "intact" and none of the lands be sold unless absolutely necessary. Burch v. Harrell, 57 Ga. App. 514, 196 S.E. 205 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When husband's will provides that all of the property of the testator is devised to the widow and the daughter for life, with remainder over to other children of the testator, and that the property of the testator be kept intact as long as either the widow or daughter should live, the wife's claim for a year's support is inconsistent with and repugnant to the will and necessarily defeats the provisions of the will, in that the allowance of a year's support to the widow will defeat the testamentary scheme of the testator, which was to provide for his wife and daughter and to keep his estate intact so long as either of them should live. Therefore the widow may elect whether she will take a life estate under the will or a year's support. Rogers v. Woods, 63 Ga. App. 195, 10 S.E.2d 404 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When by the will the widow is devised a life estate in all of the testator's property, in order to put her to an election between the provisions of the will in her favor and her right to a year's support, such provisions in the will must be either expressly made in lieu of a year's support, or the intention of the testator to that effect must be deduced by clear and manifest implication from the will, founded on the fact that the claim of year's support would be inconsistent with the will or so repugnant to the will's provisions as necessarily to defeat the provisions. Rogers v. Woods, 63 Ga. App. 195, 10 S.E.2d 404 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the will does not expressly require an election by the widow and there is no conflict of facts requiring submission to a jury, the trial court has the duty as a matter of law to determine if the will can be read to give the "clear and manifest implication" necessary to require an election of the widow. Studstill v. Studstill, 130 Ga. App. 803, 204 S.E.2d 496 (1974) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Will which did not provide that the devise of income from real property to the widow was in lieu of a year's support, as might have been done under the statute, does not preclude the widow's right to claim a year's support. Strickland v. Miles, 131 Ga. App. 300, 205 S.E.2d 880 (1974) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the will devised to the widow a life estate in the marital home, and directed payment by the estate of taxes, insurance, and certain maintenance expenses on the family home, and it contained a further provision relative to income to the widow during her lifetime, inasmuch as the unquestioned desire of the testator was to provide certain basic needs to the wife during her lifetime, there was no manifest implication of the will that would require the widow to elect between a year's support and the benefits of the will. Young v. Ellis, 250 Ga. 838, 301 S.E.2d 271 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-5).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of testamentary provision as renunciation of right to year's support.</b> - Even though the will of a decedent provides that his widow shall take under the will only if she renounces her right to a year's support, she must do some act which shows her acceptance of that provision in lieu of a year's support. Walraven v. Walraven, 76 Ga. App. 713, 47 S.E.2d 148 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When after will was probated, widow was entitled, under the will's terms, to receive, use and consume as her own what she testified she had received, this would not bar her right to a year's support or require her to account therefor in having year's support set apart. Clark v. Clark, 62 Ga. App. 738, 9 S.E.2d 710 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Withdrawal of funds by a widow</b> from a joint checking account with her deceased husband, after his death, is not tantamount to an election to take under the will of her deceased husband, particularly when there was evidence of excessive medical expenses of the widow following her husband's death. Howard v. Howard, 150 Ga. App. 213, 257 S.E.2d 336 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Estoppel.</b> - When a widow claims the legacy in lieu of a year's support made under the will and at the same time makes application to the ordinary (now probate judge) for a year's support, any interested person may file a caveat to the return of the appraisers, and may set up as a bar to the allowance of year's support an inconsistent election on the part of the widow, whereby under the provisions of the will she has estopped herself from such an allowance. Bowen v. Bowen, 200 Ga. 572, 37 S.E.2d 797 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question of fact.</b> - Summary judgment was not proper when a question of fact remained as to whether the funds received by the surviving spouse passed to her outside the estate and did not constitute an election to take under the will and if she was therefore entitled to the statutory year's support. Wynn v. Wynn, 202 Ga. App. 679, 415 S.E.2d 287 (1992) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-5). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment against a widow where she testified that she was unaware of her year's support rights at the time of her election to take two real-property bequests under the will and the executor presented no evidence that she knew the condition of the estate at that time. Brown v. Estate of Brown, 246 Ga. App. 332, 539 S.E.2d 824 (2000) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-5).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grant of life estate to widow</b> under will does not preclude award of year's support. Adams v. Adams, 249 Ga. 477, 291 S.E.2d 518 (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testamentary gift in addition to a year's support.</b> - Widow's claim for a year's support is not barred by accepting provisions made for her in her husband's will when the will does not show a plain and manifest intention on the part of the testator that the provisions made for the wife should be in lieu of a year's support, although the will provides that the executors conduct certain farming operations and pay the profits thereof to the wife, and that his property be kept "intact" and none of the lands be sold unless absolutely necessary. Burch v. Harrell, 57 Ga. App. 514, 196 S.E. 205 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Life estate in widow.</b> - When under a will the widow is given a life estate in all of the property, it is correct and proper for the appraisers to carve her year's support allowance out of the remainder interest, when that is the only interest, other than the life estate, created by the will. Saxon v. Aycock, 72 Ga. App. 728, 34 S.E.2d 914 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Widow is entitled to a 12 months' support out of the estate of her deceased husband, notwithstanding the fact that he left to her by will, which was probated over her caveat thereto, a life estate in all of his property real and personal. Russell v. Hall, 245 Ga. 677, 266 S.E.2d 491 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Will provisions in lieu of year's support.</b> - Testator can make provisions in the testator's will for the benefit of his widow and in lieu of a year's support, and when this is done the widow must elect as between the provisions of the will for her benefit and her right to a year's support. Saxon v. Aycock, 72 Ga. App. 728, 34 S.E.2d 914 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When husband's will provides that all of the property of the testator is devised to the widow and the daughter for life, with remainder over to other children of the testator, and that the property of the testator be kept intact as long as either the widow or daughter should live, the wife's claim for a year's support is inconsistent with and repugnant to the will and necessarily defeats the provisions of the will, in that the allowance of a year's support to the widow will defeat the testamentary scheme of the testator, which was to provide for his wife and daughter and to keep his estate intact so long as either of them should live. Therefore, the widow may elect whether she will take a life estate under the will or a year's support. Rogers v. Woods, 63 Ga. App. 195, 10 S.E.2d 404 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Waiver by electing to take inconsistent benefit.</b> - When a husband as the head of a family has a homestead set apart for himself and wife, and the widow after his death continues upon the property constituting the homestead for a great number of years, enjoying during that period the rents, issues, and profits of the homestead, she will not be allowed, after the expiration of such a time, to take a year's support out of the homestead property, but will be conclusively presumed to have made an election in favor of the enjoyment of the homestead as such, and against the right to have a year's support set apart to her. McDaniel v. Kelley, 61 Ga. App. 105, 5 S.E.2d 672 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In case of testacy, in order to put the widow to an election between the provisions made in her favor in the will and her right to a year's support under the statute, such testamentary provision in her favor must be either expressly made in lieu of year's support, or the intention of the testator to that effect must be deduced by clear and manifest implication from the will, founded on the fact that the claim of year's support would be inconsistent with the will or so repugnant to its provisions as necessarily to defeat them.

<p class="p6"><b>2. Qualification of Minor Children for Beneficial Interest</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Minor children must be named or described in application.</b> - In order for minor children to take an interest in property set apart as a year's support, it should in some manner appear in the application that it is made in their behalf; and when it affirmatively appears that the application was made by the widow, and that minor children were not referred to therein by name or otherwise, they take no interest in the property set apart. Farmers Bank v. Williams, 188 Ga. 789, 5 S.E.2d 195 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002); Gale v. Stewart, 105 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Names or number of children need not appear in application for year's support.</b> - In order for minor children to take an interest in the property set apart for year's support it is not necessary that their names appear in application therefore, nor does the fact that the number of the children was not set out affect their rights. Farmers Bank v. Williams, 188 Ga. 789, 5 S.E.2d 195 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When one who is not mentioned in a year's support, either by name or description, that one can take no beneficial interest thereunder; however,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is not necessary that the names or number of the minor children appear in the proceeding for them to take an interest in the property set apart. Thus, the minor children take a beneficial interest in property set apart under a year's support proceeding in which a named "widow, and . . . minor children" are designated in various portions of the proceeding. Ennis v. Ennis, 207 Ga. 665, 63 S.E.2d 887 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support to minor child.</b> - When plaintiff takes no beneficial interest in the property set aside to the widow, plaintiff is not barred, on account of the allowance to the widow, from obtaining a year's support as a minor child of the deceased. Gale v. Stewart, 105 Ga. App. 767, 125 S.E.2d 694 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

In such a situation, an independent proceeding for year's support would be proper by the one excluded. Collins v. Collins, 110 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support.</b> - In a probate matter, a trial court erred by dismissing an executor's objection to the setting aside of certain real property as a year's support in favor of an estate as the executor had filed an objection within 15 days of the default order amending the year's support order, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-55(a), and by paying costs.

<p class="p4">After the ordinary (now probate judge) receives a belated return and cites interested parties, by publication as prescribed by law, to show cause why the return should not be approved and made the judgment of the court, and such return is duly approved, it is too late for a creditor to object that the return was not made within 30 days of the appointment of the appraisers.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2573, former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3467, former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4043, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 113-1005, 113-1005.1, 113-1005.2, and 113-1005.3, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-9 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Excessive award.</b> - Award of title to the entire marital residence as year's support exceeded the amount necessary to support the surviving spouse for 12 months from the decedent's death; the surviving spouse's contributions during marriage did not entitle the surviving spouse to support based on an equitable interest in the marital residence. Hunter v. Hunter, 256 Ga. App. 898, 569 S.E.2d 919 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award of year's support to spouse upheld.</b> - When co-executors claimed that the probate court erred by failing to consider the value of the room and board the decedent's spouse received in lieu of wages from the spouse's own employer and that it improperly assumed that the spouse alone would need an amount of money equal to the amount the spouse and the decedent together had spent on living expenses in the last year of decedent's life but the co-executors failed to include in the record on appeal the transcript of the hearing on the decedent's spouse's petition for a year's support, there was no basis in the record for the court to reverse under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-7(c) an award to the spouse. In re Estate of Battle, 263 Ga. App. 73, 587 S.E.2d 140 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award of year's support improper.</b> - Undisputed evidence demanded that in light of the decedent's spouse's resources, the spouse's application for a year's support had to be denied and a directed verdict had to be granted against the spouse and in favor of the decedent's children; the evidence showed that during the 12 months following decedent's death, the spouse received $126,000 in cash from the decedent's assets outside of probate and received<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$22,019 in income for a total of $148,019. Allgood v. Allgood, 263 Ga. App. 177, 587 S.E.2d 377 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Superior court's order reversing a year's support award in the amount of $30,000, along with title to a vehicle and antique furniture, and instead enforcing an oral agreement for an equal division of the assets of the estate after payment of all expenses was proper as: (1) the wife failed to testify as to the amount of money needed to maintain the standard of living for a period of 12 months after the decedent husband died; (2) the wife presented no evidence of any income earned during the marriage; (3) no evidence documenting the wife's medical expenses incurred during the marriage was presented; and (4) the wife's testimony about the decline in the standard of living was relevant under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-7(c)(3), but provided little guidance to the court. Taylor v. Taylor, 288 Ga. App. 334, 654 S.E.2d 146 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 322 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because it appeared from the testimony that a widow's standard of living was improved after receiving an award of year's support after the decedent's death, and that the widow had the resources independent of the year's support to afford those improvements, the award was erroneously entered; thus, the trial court erred in denying a motion for involuntary dismissal filed by the decedent's only child. Anderson v. Westmoreland, 286 Ga. App. 561, 649 S.E.2d 820 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 676 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of spouse's petition for year's support improper.</b> - Probate court erred by allowing the objections of a bank and a decedent's parents solely on the basis of adverse title and by denying a year's support to the widow when the widow failed to meet the resulting burden of proof because the probate court lacked the jurisdiction under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. III, Para. I and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-9-30 to determine that the relevant money-market account and real property were not part of the estate; despite the jurisdictional limitation and the lack of an appropriate objection, the probate court proceeded to conduct a hearing as to the amount necessary for the widow's support, thereby inappropriately placing upon the widow a burden of proof that was contrary to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-7(a) and otherwise lacking in the absence of the jurisdictionally defective objections to the petition. In re Mahmoodzadeh, 314 Ga. App. 383, 724 S.E.2d 797 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Superior court erred in setting aside the year's support award for failure to provide evidence of the amount sufficient to constitute a year's support because the only issue properly before the superior court on appeal from the probate court under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-3-29 was whether or not an objection had been made to the petitioner's petition for year's support, and because the superior court found that no objection had been made to the petition for year's support, the court erred in placing the burden of proof to show the amount sufficient for year's support upon the petitioner as the language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-7(c) indicated that the petitioner shouldered that burden of proof only once an objection had been made. Garren v. Garren, 316 Ga. App. 646, 730 S.E.2d 123 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4084, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-10 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Title to property set apart as a year's support to a widow and minor children vests in them</b> for such purpose, share and share alike. Moore v. Pittman, 185 Ga. 619, 196 S.E. 50 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Vesting of title.</b> - Property duly set apart to the widow, or widow and minor child, of an intestate as a year's support vests in them, and is not subject to be administered as a part of the estate of the deceased husband or father. Holamon v. Jenkins, 50 Ga. App. 129, 177 S.E. 262 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When property owned by one at the time of one's death is set apart to one's minor children as a year's support, the title thereto vests in such children share and share alike, and a child's arrival at majority does not divest his or her legal interest. Pardue Medicine Co. v. Pardue, 194 Ga. 516, 22 S.E.2d 143 (1942) ??? (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a year's support was set aside to the widow and three minor children jointly under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002, the title thereto vested in them for their joint support and maintenance, and the other children had no interest therein. When the minor children married or attained their majority, the right of support and maintenance from the property set aside as a year's support belonged to the widow alone as long as the property lasted or as she lived, and she was entitled to its use and control. She could sell the property for her maintenance and support. The children who have attained their majority have no right to participate in its consumption or its control. King v. King, 203 Ga. 811, 48 S.E.2d 465 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When uncontradicted evidence showed that the application for a year's support made by widow was not admitted to record, and there was no judgment by the ordinary (now probate judge) making the return of the appraisers the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court), title to the property did not vest in the widow under a valid year's support proceeding.

<p class="p4"><b>Award of year's support to widow and minor child made in gross.</b> - When property is set aside to a widow and minor children in gross, the widow and minor children become owners of the property in common, and share equally in the title. Walden v. Walden, 191 Ga. 182, 12 S.E.2d 345 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an application for a year's support is made by a widow for herself and her minor child, the law contemplates that an award shall be made to such widow and minor child in gross, and not that awards shall be made to them separately; so that, although the legal title will vest in them share and share alike, the use of the entire property shall be a joint one for the support of both the mother and the child, and of neither to the exclusion of the other, so long as the widow lives and until the child marries or reaches majority. McCommons v. Reid, 201 Ga. 500, 40 S.E.2d 73 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Because the law does not confer upon the appraisers the power to direct that the fund be paid to a widow over a period of time,</b> husband's estate is not held together during the time that the fund is in the hands of husband's legal representative subject to the use of the widow; estate of the husband is divested of any interest in the money.

<p class="p4"><b>Right to testamentary disposition of property awarded as year's support.</b> - While the widow is entitled, after the child or children reach majority, to the possession of the entire property for her support and maintenance, and has the right to sell the property for such purpose, this does not include the power to give the children's share of the property to another by will. Walden v. Walden, 191 Ga. 182, 12 S.E.2d 345 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006); Barber v.

<p class="p4">When property is set apart as a year's support for the benefit of the widow alone, the fee vests in her, and she can make a testamentary disposition of the unconsumed portion thereof; and, accordingly, the petition of another seeking to recover an interest in the property as an heir at law failed to set forth a cause of action. Hiers v. Striplin, 210 Ga. 293, 79 S.E.2d 539 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of judgment setting apart year's support.</b> - Judgment setting apart a year's support is not void on the ground that the appraisers have not filed with their report a plat of the land set apart. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When no caveat to widow's application for support was filed, and citation had issued and been published as required by law, a court of equity would not set aside the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) for irregularities. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3832, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-9 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Close scrutiny when wife or child excluded.</b> - Under the general rules of evidence, every presumption is in favor of the probate of a will after it is shown that the testator was of sound mind and disposing memory at the time the will was executed; but under the statutory provisions, if it appears that the testator has excluded his wife, and that he has no child, there is but little, if any, presumption in favor of the propounder; for the will is to be closely scrutinized, and upon the slightest evidence of aberration of intellect, or collusion, or fraud, or any undue influence or unfair dealing, probate should be refused. Rules as to the nature of proof and the quantum of evidence necessary for a caveator to produce and present to the court and jury, in ordinary cases of probate of wills, can have no application in the face of the declaration that probate of a will of the class referred to should be refused upon the slightest evidence of any of the ingredients of operative causes set forth in law. The law does not define the term "slightest evidence," but it is the superlative degree of the adjective "slight," and therefore must mean very slight. Deans v. Deans, 171 Ga. 644, 156 S.E. 691 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3832); Bowman v. Bowman, 205 Ga. 796, 55 S.E.2d 298 (1949);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When one bequeaths one's entire estate to strangers to the exclusion of one's spouse and children, upon the slightest evidence of the aberration of intellect, or collusion or fraud, or any undue influence or unfair dealing, probate should be refused. Crawford v. Crawford, 218 Ga. 369, 128 S.E.2d 53 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence of aberration of intellect would, when coupled with the fact that the testator bequeathed the testator's entire estate to a stranger to the exclusion of an afflicted child as well as the testator's other children, make a question for the jury to weigh the testimony and determine whether or not the testator had the mental capacity to make a will at the time of the will's execution. English v. Shivers, 220 Ga. 737, 141 S.E.2d 443 (1965) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of pre-1998 probate code.</b> - Trial court did not err when the court applied the law in place before the 1998 probate code was adopted to determine whether a husband and wife had a contract not to revoke their joint and mutual will because the issue was not the propriety of the devises in the will but whether the husband and wife had a contract not to revoke the will; the 1998 probate code only applies to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 1998, so it would not apply to any contract allegedly made in 1980. Davis v. Parris, 289 Ga. 201, 710 S.E.2d 757 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute expressly authorizes a testator to give one's entire estate to strangers,</b> to the exclusion of one's spouse and children. Marshall v. Trust Co., 231 Ga. 415, 202 S.E.2d 94 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Word "strangers" in legal contemplation</b> has a meaning distinctly different from the meaning in common usage or parlance. For instance, one who is not a party to a contract is generally referred to as a stranger to the contract. The word is often used in a legal sense to convey the meaning converse to "privy" or "privity." Deans v. Deans, 171 Ga. 664, 156 S.E. 691 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3832).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Strangers" may include anyone other than wife or child.</b> - When a father, who has no wife, by will leaves one's entire estate to persons other than one's child, one is leaving it to "strangers" within the meaning of the law. Deans v. Deans, 171 Ga. 664, 156 S.E. 691 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3832). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute expressly authorizes a testator to give one's entire estate to strangers, who might be one's concubines, to the exclusion of one's spouse and children. Hood v. First Nat'l Bank, 219 Ga. 283, 133 S.E.2d 19 (1963) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Common-law spouse of a testator is not a stranger</b> within the meaning of the law, and the "slightest evidence of aberration of intellect" test of the law does not apply. Yuzamas v. Yuzamas, 241 Ga. 577, 247 S.E.2d 73 (1978) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Protection for wives and children.</b> - Statute which formed a distinct class to protect - the wife and children of a testator - there is no reference or provision for the husband, and therefore no law upon which the husband could caveat his wife's will, except those provided for any other heirs. Deans v. Deans, 171 Ga. 664, 156 S.E. 691 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3832). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Provisions of statute are applicable to a wife and child or children; a child or children where there is no wife; and to a wife alone where there is neither child nor children. Smith v. Davis, 203 Ga. 175, 45 S.E.2d 609 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application only if party excluded in will.</b> - Statute should be applied only if party is altogether excluded in the will. Johnson v. Sullivan, 247 Ga. 663, 278 S.E.2d 640 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When testator's wife is altogether excluded by the terms of the will,</b> the provisions of this statute apply. Gornto v. Gornto, 217 Ga. 136, 121 S.E.2d 139 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exclusion of wife prerequisite to statute's application.</b> - Provisions of this statute are applicable only when the wife, there being no child or children, is altogether excluded in the will of her husband. Beman v. Stembridge, 211 Ga. 274, 85 S.E.2d 434 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Small bequest to wife.</b> - Statute is not applicable when the testator having no children and approximately two years after separating from his wife, executed a will which provided for a $1.00 bequest to his wife. Beman v. Stembridge, 211 Ga. 274, 85 S.E.2d 434 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Child excluded.</b> - When one who has been altogether excluded in a will establishes the fact that one is a child of the testator, the trial judge must give in charge to the jury the rule of this statute. Deans v. Deans, 171 Ga. 664, 156 S.E. 691 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3832).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provisions of this statute have no application where</b> testator made a nominal bequest to his daughter, since daughter was not altogether excluded in the will. Lee v. Boyer, 217 Ga. 27, 120 S.E.2d 757 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Jury must determine whether circumstances require grant or refusal of probate.</b> Under the provisions of this statute, it is for the jury to determine whether there are any circumstances, even very slight, which make it the duty of the jury to refuse probate of a will. Deans v. Deans, 171 Ga. 664, 156 S.E. 691 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3832).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of mental state on execution date controlling.</b> - Evidence that testator had suffered aberration of intellect on dates other than the date of execution of the will did not bar probate when the evidence did not indicate such aberration on the date of execution and there was no evidence of a continuously disabling mental disorder. Dean v. Morsman, 254 Ga. 169, 327 S.E.2d 212 (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-9).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of undue influence on execution date controlling.</b> - Evidence that indicated sole beneficiary's great influence over testator in different areas of the testator's life did not bar probate where, on the date of execution of the will, testator appeared to be acting on testator's own volition and not pursuant to beneficiary's undue influence. Dean v. Morsman, 254 Ga. 169, 327 S.E.2d 212 (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-9).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Invalidation of will on ground of unreasonableness.</b> - Fact that testator made dispositions of property in the testator's will that favored the propounder and other people, and did not favor the caveator, did not show that the will could be invalidated on the ground of unreasonableness, as the testator was free under the law to bequeath the majority of the testator's estate to other relatives rather than the caveator, who was the testator's estranged wife.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intent to exclude will contestant.</b> - Probate court erred in finding a genuine issue of material fact regarding a will contestant's beneficiary status because although there could be a genuine issue of fact as to the contestant's status as the testator's daughter, resolution of that issue was unnecessary in determining the daughter's status under the will, which clearly and unambiguously expressed the testator's intent that only the daughters born of the testator's marriage would share as children thereunder; the plain terms of the will clearly reflected the testator's intent to exclude the contestant because the contestant was not mentioned in any portion of the will, as contrasted with the daughters, who were specifically designated as the testator's "two living children," were named co-executors, and were named as trustees of respective trusts created for each of them from the family trust, and by defining the term "children" as "lawful blood descendants," the testator demonstrated the testator's intent that the testator's child born out of wedlock not be included as a beneficiary under the will.

<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between deed and will.</b> - A paper reciting: "I [the maker], being in good health and of sound and disposing mind and memory, do make and publish this my last will and testament, hereby revoking all former wills by me at any time heretofore made," and containing an attestation clause reciting that the paper is "signed, sealed, published, and delivered by the" maker "as and for her last will and testament," and that the witnesses, four in number, have subscribed their names in the maker's presence and in the presence of each other, and which at the time of the paper's execution is delivered to the party for whose benefit the paper is made as the will of the maker, though the devising or granting clause may contain language appropriate to a deed in some respects, is not a deed, but is an instrument testamentary in character. Page v. Jones, 186 Ga. 485, 198 S.E. 63 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the owner of property transfers the property inter vivos to another person in trust, the disposition is not testamentary merely because the interest of the beneficiary does not take effect in enjoyment or possession before the death of the settler, or because in addition the settler reserves power to revoke or modify the trust; in such a case the trust is created in the lifetime of the settler and the mere fact that the settler can destroy the trust or alter the trust does not make the disposition testamentary, although if the trust were not to arise until the settler's death the intended trust would be testamentary. Wilder v. Howard, 188 Ga. 426, 4 S.E.2d 199 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If an instrument in the form of a deed conveys an estate in praesenti, although the right of possession be postponed, the instrument is a deed; but, if the instrument conveys no present estate or right, but is an attempt to convey an estate or right in the property upon the death of the grantor, the instrument is testamentary in character and will not be upheld as a deed. Smith v. Thomas, 199 Ga. 396, 34 S.E.2d 278 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If deed were testamentary in character, it would be of no effect, since it was not executed in the manner which would entitle it to probate as a will. Childs v. Mitchell, 204 Ga. 542, 50 S.E.2d 216 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the intention by the grantor is to convey a present estate, although possession be postponed until the death of the grantor, the instrument is a deed. Martin v. Smith, 211 Ga. 600, 87 S.E.2d 406 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Deed containing this reservation: "This conveyance is made with the distinct reservation by the grantor that she retains for herself an exclusive control of all of said lands as long as she may live, and to have the right to use them as her own and as she sees fit, including the working and selling of timber during the remainder of her natural life," is a warranty deed, and not a will. Martin v. Smith, 211 Ga. 600, 87 S.E.2d 406 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An instrument containing a reservation by a grantor, who reserved a life estate, of the right to dispose of the land that the grantor owned during the grantor's lifetime is a deed rather than an attempted will.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 113-201 and 113-206, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-2-20 and 53-2-22 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>When testamentary capacity is the issue, capacity must be determined by</b> the condition of the mind at the time of the execution of the will. Hill v. Deal, 185 Ga. 42, 193 S.E. 858 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Though, as tending to illustrate the condition of the mind, evidence may be received as to what was the mental capacity at a prior or a subsequent time, yet if it be certain from all the testimony that at the time of the execution of the instrument there was no want of testamentary capacity, the instrument offered will not be refused probate on the ground of lack of sound and disposing mind and memory. Hill v. Deal, 185 Ga. 42, 193 S.E. 858 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although evidence as to the mental capacity at a time prior or subsequent to the execution of the will may be shown to illustrate the condition of the testator's mind, still the controlling question to be determined, when testamentary capacity is the issue, is whether the testator had sufficient testamentary capacity at the time of executing the will. Spivey v. Spivey, 202 Ga. 644, 44 S.E.2d 224 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Neither age and physical impairments, nor declarations made subsequent to the execution of the will and contrary to the will's terms are sufficient alone to raise issues of mental incapacity. Irvin v. Askew, 241 Ga. 565, 246 S.E.2d 682 (1978) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What is mental capacity to make a will is a question of fact.</b> - On the trial of an issue of devisavit vel non, whether the alleged testator had mental capacity to make a will at the time of signing the paper is a question for decision by the jury, and a witness cannot testify as to such legal conclusion. Morgan v. Bell, 189 Ga. 432, 5 S.E.2d 897 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Capacity to make a contract is not identical</b> with the mental capacity necessary to make a valid will; a person with mental capacity less than that required to make a contract may have that degree of mental capacity necessary to make a valid will. Smith v. Davis, 203 Ga. 175, 45 S.E.2d 609 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Understanding nature of testament.</b> - Person has testamentary capacity who understands the nature of a testament or will, viz., that it is a disposition of property to take effect after death, and by one who is capable of remembering generally the property subject to disposition and the persons related to that person by the ties of blood and of affection, and also of conceiving and expressing by words, written or spoken, or by signs, or by both, any intelligible scheme of disposition. If the testator has sufficient intellect to enable the testator to have a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of the testator's property, this will suffice. Morgan v. Bell, 189 Ga. 432, 5 S.E.2d 897 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201); Spivey v. Spivey, 202 Ga. 644, 44 S.E.2d 224 (1947);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testimony as to mental status is necessarily opinionative,</b> and the law requires that before a will can be probated, and subscribing witnesses shall be inquired of as to apparent capacity or noncapacity; the fact that a witness witnesses a will qualifies the witness to give an opinion on that subject. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, 187 Ga. 268, 200 S.E. 679 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the testimony of both expert and nonexpert witnesses was insufficient to overcome the positive testimony of two of the subscribing witnesses, the testimony of the other subscribing witness being inconclusive, that at the time the will was executed the testator apparently had testamentary capacity, the evidence demanded a verdict in favor of the propounder. Spivey v. Spivey, 202 Ga. 644, 44 S.E.2d 224 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When there is an issue as to the testamentary capacity of the testator, the opinion as to the sanity of the testator may be given in evidence by a witness who attested the will without first stating the facts upon which one bases such opinion. Brooker v. Brooker, 208 Ga. 387, 67 S.E.2d 117 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When although the pleadings raised an issue as to testamentary capacity of the testator, not a single witness testified that the testator was not of sound and disposing memory at the time of executing or acknowledging the will, there was no evidence to carry this issue to the jury. Brooker v. Brooker, 208 Ga. 387, 67 S.E.2d 117 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption favoring testamentary capacity is necessarily a rebuttable presumption,</b> and the capacity of the testator is always a proper subject of inquiry. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, 187 Ga. 268, 200 S.E. 679 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden is on the propounder to show the factum of the will,</b> free and voluntary action, and apparent testamentary capacity, and when this is shown, together with the presumption of testamentary capacity which exists in the absence of proof, a prima facie case for the propounder is made out. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, 187 Ga. 268, 200 S.E. 679 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201); Johnson v. Sullivan, 247 Ga. 663, 278 S.E.2d 640 (1981);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the presumption in favor of testamentary capacity exists, the presumption alone is not sufficient to make out for the propounder a prima facie case. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, 187 Ga. 268, 200 S.E. 679 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201); Johnson v. Sullivan, 247 Ga. 663, 278 S.E.2d 640 (1981);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Law, in its zealousness always to safeguard the rights of a deceased testator, although presuming testamentary capacity, deems it wise not to rely solely upon that presumption, but to make inquiry into the immediate circumstances of the execution of the will from those who were present at the time. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, 187 Ga. 268, 200 S.E. 679 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Charge that the presumption is always in favor of a mental capacity to make a will, where elsewhere in the charge the jury was instructed that the burden was on the propounder to establish the factum of the will, that it was freely and voluntarily made, and that the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make a will, as a prerequisite to the making out by the propounder of a prima facie case was not error. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, 187 Ga. 268, 200 S.E. 679 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p4">This section carries over the concepts of former OCGA Secs. 53-2-21, 53-2-23, and 53-2-25.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Former Code Sec. 53-2-21 described the capacity necessary to make a will as including a "decided and rational desire" on the part of the testator: "decided, as distinguished from the wavering, vacillating fancies of a distempered intellect, and rational, as distinguished from the ravings of a madman, the silly pratings of an idiot, the childish whims of imbecility, or the excited vagaries of a drunkard."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The changes from the former Code section are not intended to change the standard for determining testamentary capacity, but rather to eliminate from the Code language that was merely illustrative and, in some cases, outdated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The terms "insane" and "monomania," while of uncertain medical meaning, are retained because they have been defined or referred to often in Georgia case law. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Former OCGA Sec. 53-2-24 is not carried forward so that individuals who are suffering from disabilities such as hearing or speech impairments or visual impairments may make wills in the same way as individuals who do not suffer from such impairments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Capacity to make a contract is not identical with the mental capacity necessary to make a valid will;</b> a person with mental capacity less than that required to make a contract may have that degree of mental capacity necessary to make a valid will. Smith v. Davis, 203 Ga. 175, 45 S.E.2d 609 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Person has testamentary capacity who understands the nature of a testament or will,</b> viz., that it is a disposition of property to take effect after death, and by one who is capable of remembering generally the property subject to disposition and the persons related to that person by the ties of blood and of affection, and also of conceiving and expressing by words, written or spoken, or by signs, or by both, any intelligible scheme of disposition. If the testator has sufficient intellect to enable the testator to have a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of the testator's property, this will suffice. Griffin v. Barrett, 183 Ga. 152, 187 S.E. 828 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205); Morgan v. Bell, 189 Ga. 432, 5 S.E.2d 897 (1939); Fowler v.

<p class="p4">As tending to illustrate the mental condition at that time, evidence of such condition at other times may be received; but when it is sought to establish testamentary incapacity by such evidence, it does not controvert the positive testimony of the subscribing witnesses unless it would be proof of testamentary incapacity at the time the will was signed. Anderson v. Anderson, 210 Ga. 464, 80 S.E.2d 807 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-204). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In order to execute a will it is necessary, as a minimum, that the testator have a rational desire as to the disposition of the testator's property.

<p class="p4">While the fact that a person did or did not become insolvent, displease one's family, or become dependent as the result of signing a deed is not evidence of mental capacity, yet if his or her mental capacity was so impaired that he or she did not know at the time whether such would or could be the case, then such person would not have the capacity to make a will much less the capacity to execute a deed. Joiner v. Joiner, 225 Ga. 699, 171 S.E.2d 297 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Terminal cancer patient capacity to execute wills while taking prescription medications.</b> - When a testator, who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, executed one will in February 2004 and another shortly before the testator's death in October 2004, there was sufficient evidence to support a jury's finding that the testator lacked testamentary capacity at the time the testator executed the October will; there was evidence that the testator was taking medication that had as possible side effects hallucination, disorientation, impaired mental performance, and confusion; that two days before the will was executed, the testator had difficulty completing sentences, was somewhat forgetful, and denied having siblings; and that on the day the will was executed, a witness, who described the testator as "morphined up," saw a beneficiary of the will repeatedly administer medicine to the testator via an eyedropper used to administer narcotics. Lillard v. Owens, 281 Ga. 619, 641 S.E.2d 511 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court was authorized to conclude that a decedent's will was invalid based on the decedent's lack of testamentary capacity under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-11 based on evidence that the decedent was confused and disoriented, did not recognize family members, and had a car accident after which doctors found the decedent was unable to make decisions personally.

<p class="p4"><b>Physical infirmities and weakness of intellect resulting from old age</b> do not constitute mental incapacity to make a will, unless such weakness actually amounts to imbecility. Bailey v. Bailey, 204 Ga. 556, 50 S.E.2d 617 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Impact of dementia.</b> - In a will contest, it was error to grant propounders' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as there was some evidence that the 95-year-old decedent lacked testamentary capacity, including expert testimony that the decedent suffered from some degree of dementia and testimony that the decedent appeared confused and spoke of deceased relations as if the relatives were alive. Mosley v. Warnock, 282 Ga. 488, 651 S.E.2d 696 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unreasonable disposition of property alone insufficient to prove testamentary incapacity.</b> - An unnatural or unreasonable disposition of one's property is not of itself sufficient to justify a finding that a testator was lacking in testamentary capacity. Watkins v. Jones, 184 Ga. 831, 193 S.E. 889 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasonableness or unreasonableness of the disposition of a testator's estate</b> has strong evidential value on the issue as to the testator's testamentary capacity and when the extent of the mental weakness is in doubt. Ellis v. Britt, 181 Ga. 442, 182 S.E. 596 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When to the probate of a will a caveat has been filed on the grounds of testamentary incapacity or undue influence, and there is doubt as to the extent of weakness of intellect, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the disposition of the estate may be considered by the jury. In the trial of such issue the source from which the property disposed of by the will came into the decedent's possession may be shown. Shaw v. Fehn, 196 Ga. 661, 27 S.E.2d 406 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, in probate proceeding, there is nothing in the testimony taken as a whole to support a finding that when the will was executed testator did not possess testamentary capacity, it was therefore erroneous to submit that issue to the jury. Brumbelow v. Hopkins, 197 Ga. 247, 29 S.E.2d 42 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On the propounding of a will, where the question is insanity, monomania, or undue influence, the unreasonableness of the disposition of the will is always a question to be considered by the jury. A reasonable disposition of property, without more, strongly indicates mental capacity to make a will. An unreasonable disposition of property may indicate a lack of mental capacity to make a will. It follows that a reasonable or unreasonable disposition of property, regardless of the nature of the insanity or inability alleged, should be given much consideration by the jury, if any doubt exists from the evidence as to the testator's ability to make the alleged will. Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 202 Ga. 391, 43 S.E.2d 329 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The reasonableness, or unreasonableness of a will, while a legitimate subject of investigation by a jury in case of doubt as to the testator's capacity to make a will, is not to be considered until such a doubt has been first created by other evidence. Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 202 Ga. 391, 43 S.E.2d 329 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-205).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient evidence of revocation of will.</b> - Evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the trial court to find, as a matter of fact, that the decedent had the necessary mental capacity to revoke a 1988 will because the record showed that the relevant circumstances had changed significantly in the 16 years since the execution of the 1988 will, giving the decedent good reasons to want to revoke the old will such as several people listed in the 1988 will having died, including both of the co-executors named.

<p class="p4">It takes a greater quantum or higher degree of mentality to make a contract than it does to make a will. Anderson v. Anderson, 210 Ga. 464, 80 S.E.2d 807 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-202). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Although evidence as to the mental capacity at a time prior or subsequent to the execution of the will may be shown to illustrate the condition of the testator's mind, still the controlling question to be determined, when testamentary capacity is the issue, is whether the testator had sufficient testamentary capacity at the time of executing the will.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delusions have to be insane to deprive one of testamentary capacity.</b> - In a dispute concerning the distribution of the decedent's estate, the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the verdict finding that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity because there was no evidence that the decedent lacked the ability to form a decided and rational desire as to the disposition of the decedent's property; and the caveators expressly disclaimed that the decedent was insane or suffered from monomania, and, instead, they merely argued that the decedent suffered from delusions; however, the caveators' claim nevertheless failed as the case law was clear that not every delusion deprived one of testamentary capacity, rather, it had to be an insane delusion, but none of the decedent's delusions were insane ones.

<p class="p4">When the witnesses, both for the propounder and the caveator, testified to the effect that the deceased had perfectly normal periods up until a very short time before death, almost all the facts relied upon to establish the mental incapacity of the deceased occurred after the will was executed, most of them very shortly before death, the only doctor who testified said that the next year after the will was executed the deceased was perfectly normal, and on the date the will was executed, the deceased went to the office of the deceased's attorney and in a perfectly intelligent manner furnished the information for the preparation of the will, all of the subscribing witnesses testifying that the deceased was perfectly normal the day the will was executed, the evidence was not sufficient to carry the burden placed by law upon the caveator.

<p class="p4">Upon the trial of an issue arising upon the propounding of a will and a caveat thereto, the burden, in the first instance, is upon the propounder of the alleged will to make out a prima facie case, by showing the factum of the will and that at the time of the will's execution the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make the will, and, in making the will, acted freely and voluntarily. When this is done, the burden of proof shifts to the caveator. Cornelius v.

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of undue influence rule.</b> - The undue influence rule not only does not challenge the right of the citizen to make a will, but contemplates added protection of that right, and works destruction to any disposition by will and testament of property by any person other than the person entitled to make disposition thereof.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time of submission of will for probate cannot be basis for undue influence.</b> - Fact that the propounder may have submitted will for probate sooner than might seem appropriate under the proprieties cannot be said to have any bearing upon the question as to whether or not the instrument was procured under undue influence at the time of its execution. Ehlers v. Rheinberger, 204 Ga. 226, 49 S.E.2d 535 (1948), for comment, see 11 Ga. B.J. 348 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What constitutes undue influence.</b> - Undue influence, to invalidate a will, must amount to force or fear and must, in effect, make the will the mental offspring of some other person, and be operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will is executed. It must destroy the free agency of the testator and constrain the testator to do what is against the testator's will, but what the testator is unable to refuse. Trust Co. v. Ivey, 178 Ga. 629, 173 S.E. 648 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Crews v. Crews, 219 Ga. 459, 134 S.E.2d 27 (1963);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Undue influence in procuring a will to be made must amount to moral coercion; it must destroy the free agency of the testator and constrain the testator to do what is against the testator's will but which the testator is unable to refuse. Griffin v. Barrett, 183 Ga. 152, 187 S.E. 828 (1936), later appeal, 185 Ga. 443, 195 S.E. 746 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The undue influence which the law contemplates as a ground to invalidate a properly executed will must be such as amounts to fraud, deceit, force, or coercion, destroying the testator's free agency. It must also be operative at the time the will is executed, and not merely at some other time. Boland v. Aycock, 191 Ga. 327, 12 S.E.2d 319 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Undue influence or fraud, to invalidate the will, must amount to force or fear and must, in effect, make the will the mental offspring of some other person, and must be operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will is executed. Butler v. Lashley, 197 Ga. 461, 29 S.E.2d 508 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Undue influence which operates to invalidate a will is such influence as amounts either to deception, or to force and coercion, destroying free agency. Butler v. Lashley, 197 Ga. 461, 29 S.E.2d 508 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Ehlers v. Rheinberger, 204 Ga. 226, 49 S.E.2d 535 (1948); Morgan v. Ivey, 222 Ga. 850, 152 S.E.2d 833 (1967), for comment, see 11 Ga. B.J. 348 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Sauls v. Estate of Avant, 143 Ga. App. 469, 238 S.E.2d 564 (1977) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To be sufficient to invalidate a will on the ground of undue influence, the evidence must show that such influence amounted to fear, force, overpersuasion, or coercion, to the extent of destroying the free agency and will power of the testator, and in effect made the will the mental offspring of another; and it must be shown that the undue influence was operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will was actually executed and published. Bailey v. Bailey, 204 Ga. 556, 50 S.E.2d 617 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Sweat v. Hughes, 219 Ga. 703, 135 S.E.2d 409 (1964);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Undue influence in procuring a will may exist in many forms, and it may be operated through diverse channels; the existence and effective power of undue influence is not always susceptible of direct proof, but may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Stephens v. Brady, 209 Ga. 428, 73 S.E.2d 182 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Such influence that is obtained by flattery, importunity, superiority of will, mind, or character, which would give dominion over the will to such an extent as to destroy free agency, or constrain one to do against one's will what one is unable to refuse, such is the kind of influence which the law condemns as undue. Sauls v. Estate of Avant, 143 Ga. App. 469, 238 S.E.2d 564 (1977) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>There can be no fatally undue influence without</b> a person incapable of protecting oneself as well as a wrongdoer to be resisted. Morgan v. Ivey, 222 Ga. 850, 152 S.E.2d 833 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Sauls v. Estate of Avant, 143 Ga. App. 469, 238 S.E.2d 564 (1977);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Undue influence must exist at time of execution of will.</b> - Evidence of undue influence over the mind and will of the testator at another time will not invalidate a will. Only such influence which exists at the time of the purported will's execution destroys the testator's freedom of volition so as to invalidate a will. Crews v. Crews, 219 Ga. 459, 134 S.E.2d 27 (1963) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It must be shown that the undue influence was operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will was actually executed and published. Morgan v. Ivey, 222 Ga. 850, 152 S.E.2d 833 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Sauls v. Avant, 143 Ga. App. 469, 238 S.E.2d 564 (1977);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">For undue influence to be a proper ground of caveat, it must exist at the time of the will's execution. Pendley v. Pendley, 251 Ga. 30, 302 S.E.2d 554 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Undue influence exercised prior to execution of the paper may continue</b> to operate on the mind of the testator until the paper is actually executed; and if upon account thereof the testator executes a paper in which the will of the person exercising the influence is substituted for that of the testator, the paper will be void, though the influence commenced at an antecedent date. Trust Co. v. Ivey, 178 Ga. 629, 173 S.E. 648 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Undue influence of wife may continue subsequent to death of wife.</b> - If the undue influence was exercised by a wife, the effect thereof may have continued after her death and may have been operative upon her husband at the time he executed the paper shortly after her death. Trust Co. v. Ivey, 178 Ga. 629, 173 S.E. 648 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Undue influence is a question of fact requiring jury consideration.</b> - It cannot be said as a matter of law that undue influence shown to have been exerted by the wife was not operative upon the husband at the time he executed his will, where the wife died only a short time before the paper was executed. Trust Co. v. Ivey, 178 Ga. 629, 173 S.E. 648 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Mere absence of direct evidence and circumstances showing that the propounder practiced fraud or undue influence at or about the time the last will was executed did not demand a finding in favor of the propounder since there was evidence, direct and circumstantial, from which the jury could have drawn the conclusion that the last will as executed by the testator resulted from prior fraud and undue influence practiced by the propounder upon the testator, and that these prior actions of the propounder controlled the mind of the testator at the time the testator executed the last will. Stephens v. Brady, 209 Ga. 428, 73 S.E.2d 182 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the motions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict filed by the executors of a will and trust because there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the documents were invalid as a product of undue influence based on the executors taking complete control of the elderly testator and isolating the testator from the testator's sons, as well as substituting desires and having the testator sign a new will and trust, which benefitted the executors and excluded the testator's wife and sons. Davison v. Hines, 291 Ga. 434, 729 S.E.2d 330 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Will propounder was not entitled to a directed verdict in a will caveat as the evidence established a question for the jury on the issue of undue influence because there was more than merely an opportunity for the propounder to influence the testator; there was also evidence of the testator's diminished mental faculties and an established confidential relationship between the propounder and the testator. Odom v. Hughes, 293 Ga. 447, 748 S.E.2d 839 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No undue influence when attorney not agent of propounder.</b> - When attorney who drafted the will was not an agent of the propounder, and since no agent of the propounder was present when the will was executed, an inference is assumed that there was no undue influence at the crucial time of execution. Norton v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust, 248 Ga. 847, 285 S.E.2d 910 (1982), aff'd, 253 Ga. 596, 322 S.E.2d 870 (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fraud</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud is a distinct head of objection to the validity of a will,</b> from importunity and undue influence; usually they are the very opposites of each other. Both are equally destructive of the validity of a will. Stephens v. Brady, 209 Ga. 428, 73 S.E.2d 182 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 113-208, 113-209).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud, to invalidate a will, must amount to force or fear</b> and must, in effect, make the will the mental offspring of some other person, and must be operative on the mind of the testator at the time the will is executed. Butler v. Lashley, 197 Ga. 461, 29 S.E.2d 508 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-209).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud must affect testator's plan in making will.</b> - There was no fraud when the basis for such claim was the attorney's failure to inform testator as to the powers and fees of an executor, matters which did not affect the testator's plan in making the testator's will. Yancey v. Hall, 265 Ga. 466, 458 S.E.2d 121 (1995) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-209). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly granted a will beneficiary summary judgment on the issue of fraud because there was no evidence in the record that would create a genuine issue of material fact as to fraud since the alleged two misrepresentations were not shown to have been relied upon by the testator when the will was created. Johnson v. Burrell, 294 Ga. 301, 751 S.E.2d 301 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Representations of infidelity sufficient to raise presumption of fraud.</b> - For one to represent to a wife that her husband is unfaithful to his marital vows, and giving to another the love and affection due his wife, whether the representation of infidelity be true or false, is likely to strongly influence her in the disposition of the property she may leave; hence, the evidence on behalf of the caveators was sufficient on the issue of fraud to have gone to the jury. Stephens v. Brady, 209 Ga. 428, 73 S.E.2d 182 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-209).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of fraud practiced prior to execution of will.</b> - Mere absence of direct evidence and circumstances showing that the propounder practiced fraud at or about the time the last will was executed did not demand a finding in favor of the propounder where there was evidence, direct and circumstantial, from which the jury could have drawn the conclusion that the last will as executed by the testator resulted from prior fraud practiced by the propounder upon the testator, and that these prior actions of the propounder controlled the mind of the testator at the time the testator executed the last will. Stephens v. Brady, 209 Ga. 428, 73 S.E.2d 182 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-209).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud established.</b> - There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that a testator's will was procured by fraud because the propounder and the propounder's wife encouraged the caveator and the caveator's spouse to go on vacation, and they embarked on a campaign to convince the testator that the caveator had stolen all the testator's money, left the testator broke, and abandoned the testator; those were misrepresentations, but the misrepresentations worked because the testator changed the testator's will to disinherit the caveator completely, and as a result of those misrepresentations, the testator went into the meeting with the attorney who drafted the will intending to leave the testator's entire estate to the propounder, and the testator would have done so were it not for the attorney's suggestion that the testator leave something to the caveator's children, who were the testator's grandchildren.

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof shifts to caveator when prima facie case made by propounder of will.</b> - Upon the trial of an issue arising upon the propounding of a will and a caveat thereto, the burden, in the first instance, is upon the propounder of the alleged will to make out a prima facie case, by showing the factum of the will and that at the time of the will's execution the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make the will, and, in making the will, acted freely and voluntarily. When this is done, the burden of proof shifts to the caveator. Cornelius v. Crosby, 243 Ga. 26, 252 S.E.2d 455 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cross examination of executor on effect of in terrorem.</b> - In a will contest, the caveator was properly prevented from cross-examining the executor as to the effect of the will's in terrorem clause as the uncontroverted testimony showed that the testator was of sound mind and was not influenced by the desires of others, and evidence as to the effect of the forfeiture provision would not have been probative of either undue influence or the lack of testamentary capacity. Caswell v. Caswell, 285 Ga. 277, 675 S.E.2d 19 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury question as to undue influence.</b> - It is for the jury to say under the circumstances, whether undue influence has been exercised. Bryan v. Norton, 245 Ga. 347, 265 S.E.2d 282 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It is reversible error to charge on undue influence when there is no evidence</b> to show that undue influence was exerted upon a testator, resulting in the testator making the will. Orr v. Blalock, 195 Ga. 863, 25 S.E.2d 668 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Proof</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for rebuttable presumption of undue influence.</b> - In order to give rise to the rebuttable presumption that a will is the void product of undue influence, the evidence must show a confidential relationship wherein the primary beneficiary was capable of exerting the power of leadership over the submissive testator. Crumbley v. McCart, 271 Ga. 274, 517 S.E.2d 786 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of circumstantial evidence permissible as proof of undue influence.</b> - Undue influence in procuring a will may exist in many forms, and it may be operated through diverse channels; the existence and effective power of undue influence is not always susceptible of direct proof and undue influence may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Stephens v. Bonner, 174 Ga. 128, 162 S.E. 383 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3834).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Very wide range of testimony is permissible on the issue of undue influence,</b> due to the fact that it seldom can be shown except by circumstantial evidence. It results from the circumstances and surroundings of the testator and the testator's associations with the person or persons exercising the undue influence. Peretzman v. Simon, 185 Ga. 681, 196 S.E. 471 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Bowman v.

<p class="p4"><b>It is proper to consider the testator's dealings and associations with the beneficiaries,</b> the testator's habits, motives, feelings, the testator's strength or weakness of character, the testator's confidential, family, social, and business relations, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the will, the testator's mental and physical condition at the time the will was made; the testator's manner and conduct, and generally every fact which will throw light on the issue raised by the charge of undue influence. Stephens v. Bonner, 174 Ga. 128, 162 S.E. 383 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3834); Peretzman v. Simon, 185 Ga. 681, 196 S.E. 471 (1938); Fowler v.

<p class="p4">In determining whether undue influence had been exercised by the wife, so as to substitute her will for that of her husband in his last will and testament, all of the circumstances including the conduct and demeanor of the parties with respect to each other, their comparative ages and mental capacity, and especially any physical and mental infirmity due to advanced age of the husband, may be taken into consideration. Trust Co. v. Ivey, 178 Ga. 629, 173 S.E. 648 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegations of undue influence must be accompanied by the particular facts.</b> Bare conclusions such as "fraud, scheme, device, and undue influence" are insufficient allegations in a caveat to present an issue. English v. Shivers, 219 Ga. 515, 133 S.E.2d 867 (1963) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the caveat is stripped of allegations as to matters which do not appear to have had any bearing or influence upon the testator in the making of the testator's will and nothing remains except bare conclusions of the pleader as to fraud, scheme, device, and undue influence, the caveat does not provide sufficient issues to challenge the validity of the will. Marlin v. Hill, 192 Ga. 434, 15 S.E.2d 473 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Allegations of a caveat need not in each instance furnish the exact or precise words</b> and language employed for the purpose of unduly influencing the testator or the exact dates upon which this is said to have occurred. Levens v. Levens, 203 Ga. 646, 47 S.E.2d 748 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient allegation of fraud or undue influence.</b> - Allegations in a caveat to the probate of a will, "that the deceased had been insane for six or seven years prior to his death, was insane at the time the alleged will was signed, if he ever signed it, and that said alleged will is only the will" of named beneficiaries and "ought not to be probated as the will" of the alleged testator, and that the caveator had paid for the funeral expenses of the decedent without any knowledge that the chief named beneficiaries "had had decedent make a will giving them everything he had, if he ever signed the will," were insufficient to present any issue as to fraud or undue influence. Hastings v. Hastings, 175 Ga. 805, 166 S.E. 192 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3834). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ruling upholding the 2010 will was affirmed because subscribing witnesses stated in an affidavit that the testatrix was mentally competent when the will was executed, it was self-proved, and contained an affidavit complying with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-24, which created a presumption that the will was executed with the requisite testamentary formalities, including that the testatrix had sufficient mental capacity to do so, and the challenger failed to rebut that presumption. Woods v. Stonecipher, 349 Ga. App. 698, 824 S.E.2d 633 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegations of mental incapacity require examination of reasonableness of will.</b> - When a will is attacked upon the grounds of the mental incapacity of the testator, and of undue influence in the procurement of the will, it is always proper to inquire whether the provisions of the will are just and reasonable, and in accord with the state of the testator's family relations, or the contrary. Knox v. Knox, 213 Ga. 677, 101 S.E.2d 89 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence required to show undue influence varies as to peculiar circumstances.</b> - Rules of evidence take into account the peculiar circumstances surrounding the issue of undue influence and acts, conduct, and circumstances may constitute undue influence when exercised on a person of failing mind, poor health, and other mental and bodily enfeeblements which would not be such undue influence as to void a will executed by a person of sound mind, good health, and intelligence. Bowman v. Bowman, 205 Ga. 796, 55 S.E.2d 298 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Quantity of influence varies with the circumstances of each case, according to the relations existing between the parties and the strength or weakness of mind of the testator; thus, the amount of influence necessary to dominate a mind impaired by age or disease may be decidedly less than that required to control a strong mind. Bowman v. Bowman, 205 Ga. 796, 55 S.E.2d 298 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Undue influence necessary to dominate a mind impaired by age, disease, or dissipation is less than that required to control a strong mind. Crews v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere confidential relationship insufficient as proof of undue influence.</b> - Person standing in a confidential relation to another is not prohibited from exercising any influence whatever to obtain a benefit to oneself. The influence must be what the law regards as undue influence; such influence that is obtained by flattery, importunity, superiority of will, mind, or character, which would give dominion over the will to such an extent as to destroy free agency or to constrain one to do against one's will what one is unable to refuse. Daniel v. Etheredge, 198 Ga. 191, 31 S.E.2d 181 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208); Bailey v. Bailey, 204 Ga. 556, 50 S.E.2d 617 (1948); Morgan v.

<p class="p4">Merely showing that the persons receiving substantial benefits under the instrument sought to be propounded occupied a confidential relationship to the testator and had an opportunity to exert undue influence is insufficient to show undue influence. Crews v. Crews, 219 Ga. 459, 134 S.E.2d 27 (1963) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly granted a will beneficiary summary judgment on the issue of undue influence because the caveators failed to come forward with any evidence that the beneficiary attempted to influence the making or the contents of the testator's will despite the existence of a confidential relationship. Johnson v. Burrell, 294 Ga. 301, 751 S.E.2d 301 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption arises when such beneficiary is not natural object of maker's bounty.</b> - When a person obtaining a substantial benefit under a will occupies a confidential relationship toward the maker of the will and is not a natural object of the maker's bounty, a presumption of undue influence arises if it is shown that the will was made at the request of such person. Bryan v. Norton, 245 Ga. 347, 265 S.E.2d 282 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Representation of infidelity between spouses as undue influence.</b> - For one to represent to a wife that her husband is unfaithful to his marital vows, and giving to another the love and affection due his wife, whether the representation of infidelity is true or false, is likely to strongly influence her in the disposition of the property she may leave; hence, the evidence on behalf of the caveators was sufficient on the issues of fraud and undue influence to have gone to the jury. Stephens v. Brady, 209 Ga. 428, 73 S.E.2d 182 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of undue influence is rebuttable.</b> - Presumption of undue influence based on the existence of confidential relations between the beneficiary and the testator and the active participation of the beneficiary in the execution of the will is rebuttable by any evidence showing that the testator acted freely and voluntarily in making the testator's will and not under the coercion of the person charged with undue influence. Bryan v. Norton, 245 Ga. 347, 265 S.E.2d 282 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Persuasion is not undue influence.</b> - Honest persuasion to make a will of a certain kind, though constant and importunate and though accompanied by tears and entreaties, does not constitute undue influence, in the absence of fraud or duress, even though the testator yields to the influence in order to have quiet or peace of mind, or to keep the respect or love of members of the testator's family; provided the testator is in a mental condition to make a choice between following the testator's original intention or of yielding the testator's view in favor of the wishes of the other person. Boland v. Aycock, 191 Ga. 327, 12 S.E.2d 319 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Evidence of the caveators on the question of whether the paper propounded for probate was the result of undue influence exercised over the mind of the testator failed to present an issue for the jury; it showed no more than a mere opportunity to exercise undue influence, which is not sufficient. Bailey v. Bailey, 204 Ga. 556, 50 S.E.2d 617 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-208). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>No lack of testamentary capacity.</b> - Daughter failed to show lack of testamentary capacity despite the fact that the testator's medical record contained the word "dementia" without an indication as to whether it was used as a diagnosis, a report from family members, or a matter for concern at later examinations; the testator's accountant and lawyer testified that the testator was aware of the property the testator possessed and of the relatives and that the testator expressed an intelligent scheme of disposition.

<p class="p4"><b>Undue influence established.</b> - Evidence did not demand a verdict contrary to that returned by the jury, which found that in executing a new will that favored the appellants over the appellees, the testator had been subject to undue influence by the appellants; there was evidence that the testator was cared for 24 hours a day by the appellants, who administered medication to the testator; that an appellant was with the testator during visits; that the appellees felt uncomfortable when visiting; that an appellant had the testator's financial power of attorney, wrote checks on the testator's accounts, and kept the testator's books; that two of the appellants had an attorney draft the new will and provided the attorney with an estate distribution plan; that the new will was witnessed by a neighbor and two cousins of the appellants; that an appellant administered a narcotic to the testator on the day the new will was executed; that the appellants did not inform the appellees of the new will; and that the terms of the new will were inconsistent with the testator's repeated statements to others that the parties were to be treated equally. Lillard v. Owens, 281 Ga. 619, 641 S.E.2d 511 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court correctly denied an executor's motion for directed verdict in an action wherein the child of the testator filed a caveat and objection to the probate of the testator's last will and testament on the grounds that the will was the product of undue influence as sufficient evidence existed to support the conclusion that undue influence was used to have the testator bequeath the only asset, namely a home, to the caregiver who was hired by the executor. The record established that the executor blocked calls from the testator's child, refused to let the child see the testator, and a confidential relationship was established between the caregiver and the testator as the caregiver took an active role in the planning, preparation, and execution of the will. Bean v. Wilson, 283 Ga. 511, 661 S.E.2d 518 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence regarding the circumstances and surroundings of the testator and the testator's associations authorized the jury's finding that the testator's will was the product of undue influence because the propounder and the propounder's wife encouraged the caveator and the caveator's wife, who had moved in with the testator and the testator's wife and provided the care they needed, to leave the state for a vacation, and in their absence the propounder poisoned the testator's mind against the caveator, telling the testator falsely that the caveator had stolen all the caveator's money, that the testator was broke, and that the caveator had abandoned the testator and would not return; acting under the influence of the propounder and the propounder's wife, the testator secured a restraining order that prevented the caveator from seeing the testator for six months after the caveator returned, and the testator's will radically changed the distribution of the estate envisioned by the testator in a previous will by changing the will to disinherit the caveator completely.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 113-109 and 113-301, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose.</b> - Substantive origin of the statute of frauds, as well as that of the former section, was the need to establish rules for the execution of wills which precluded as well as possible the occurrence of fraud in the disposition of estates, often the result of a life's labor. Waldrep v. Goodwin, 230 Ga. 1, 195 S.E.2d 432 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Law provides no special formalities about the witnesses to a will;</b> it is sufficient if the witnesses attest and subscribe the will in the presence of the testator; the law implies the request in the consummation of the act, and no special request by the testator is necessary. Whitfield v. Pitts, 205 Ga. 259, 53 S.E.2d 549 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Attestation of a will by the subscribing witnesses, signed by the witnesses in the presence of the testator and with the testator's knowledge may be treated as the equivalent of a request by the testator that these persons subscribe their names as witnesses to the paper, and especially when such testator is shown to have been seeking witnesses for the purpose of having the witnesses attest the testator's will. Glenn v. Mann, 234 Ga. 194, 214 S.E.2d 911 (1975) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Designation-of-beneficiary document insufficient to operate as will.</b> - Although the designation-of-beneficiary document for purposes of decedent's teachers' retirement system benefits executed by the decedent in 1965 did contain the signature of a notary public, as well as the signature of the decedent's employer, there was no showing that these persons signed the document in the presence of the decedent as attesting witnesses and therefore the document could not operate as a will. Kirksey v. Teachers' Retirement Sys., 250 Ga. 884, 302 S.E.2d 101 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Wills must be in writing, and executed according to prescribed formalities,</b> and a failure to dispose of property cannot be supplied by showing sayings and statements of the testator that the testator desired or intended to dispose of the property in a certain way, or that the testator understood that the will disposed of the property in a way different from that expressed in the will. Lining v. Jackson, 203 Ga. 22, 45 S.E.2d 410 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the only objection which the caveator makes to the appointment of an administrator is that it was the intention of the testator that the property should go to the caveator, and there is nothing in the will to indicate that such was the testator's intent, the court properly sustained the demurrer (now motion to dismiss) to the caveat. Lining v. Jackson, 203 Ga. 22, 45 S.E.2d 410 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Woo v. Markwalter, 210 Ga. 156, 78 S.E.2d 473 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attestation clause.</b> - Paper testamentary in its nature does not require for its due execution an attesting clause declaring it a will, and reciting its execution according to the terms of the statute, pointing out how wills shall be executed. If it be subscribed by the testator, in the presence of the witnesses, and be attested and subscribed by the witnesses in the testator's presence, it is sufficient. Whitfield v. Pitts, 205 Ga. 259, 53 S.E.2d 549 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acknowledgment may be inferred.</b> - Acknowledgment by testator need not be explicit, but may be inferred from conduct. Norton v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust, 248 Ga. 847, 285 S.E.2d 910 (1982), aff'd, 253 Ga. 596, 322 S.E.2d 870 (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testator may sign using any name or signature intended to authenticate</b> an instrument as testator's will. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 245 Ga. 291, 264 S.E.2d 222 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testator's mark sufficient to show intent to authenticate will.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a propounder's motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether a testator's will was properly executed because pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20(a), the testator's mark was sufficient to show that she intended to authenticate the instrument as her will, and her intent to authenticate the will could not be questioned simply because she needed physical assistance to mark the instrument; the testator was unable to place her signature on the will, so one of the witnesses assisted her by moving her hand to the signature line, and it was her intent that the mark would serve as her signature. Strong v. Holden, 287 Ga. 482, 697 S.E.2d 189 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Express direction" required by statute</b> may be by express conduct as well as by express words. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 245 Ga. 291, 264 S.E.2d 222 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Testator's hand resting upon the pen while it was being manipulated to produce the testator's signature constitutes the testator's "express direction" within the meaning of law. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 245 Ga. 291, 264 S.E.2d 222 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's assistance in helping testator sign will.</b> - When there was evidence that the attorney who prepared the will enabled the testator, who because of the testator's physical condition could not write, to make the testator's mark by placing the testator's hand upon the pen as the mark was made, this was sufficient to authorize the jury to find that the testator signed the will. Crutchfield v. McCallie, 188 Ga. 833, 5 S.E.2d 33 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Particular acts of authentication.</b> - Statute does not of itself make that which is attested by a witness the signature of the testator. Like the statute of frauds upon which it was modeled, it does not set forth any particular acts of authentication by the testator to be attested by the witnesses. Waldrep v. Goodwin, 230 Ga. 1, 195 S.E.2d 432 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testator to sign in presence of witnesses.</b> - To constitute a legal execution of an instrument purporting to be a will, it is absolutely necessary that the attesting witnesses either actually see the testator sign the instrument, or that the testator acknowledge the testator's signature thereto either expressly or impliedly. Thornton v. Hulme, 218 Ga. 480, 128 S.E.2d 744 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301); Glenn v. Mann, 234 Ga. 194, 214 S.E.2d 911 (1975);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As with questions of the authenticity of the testator's signature, of the testamentary capacity of the testator, and of the undue influence upon the testator of others in making the testator's will, the signing, or acknowledgment of the testator's signature, by the testator in the presence of attesting witnesses is a matter of proof. Waldrep v. Goodwin, 230 Ga. 1, 195 S.E.2d 432 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Attestation of a will requires that the testator must either sign in the presence of the witness or acknowledge the testator's signature to the witness. Norton v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust, 248 Ga. 847, 285 S.E.2d 910 (1982), aff'd, 253 Ga. 596, 322 S.E.2d 870 (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testator must be able to see witnesses sign a will.</b> - Line-of-vision test of former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20, under which a testator must be able to see the witnesses sign the testator's will from the place where the testator is situated without changing the testator's place if the testator so desires is part of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20 as revised in 1998; revised statutory language must be construed to be consistent with existing law unless a contrary intent is clear from the language of the revised statute, and because no contrary intent appears in <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20, which mirrors the language of the previous version, the formalities of the former Georgia Probate Code for the execution of a will are maintained. McCormick v. Jeffers, 281 Ga. 264, 637 S.E.2d 666 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Will not signed in the presence of the testator.</b> - Will of a testator was improperly admitted to probate under the line-of-vision test of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20(b) because the witnesses signed the will at a dining room table where the testator could not see them without changing position from the bedroom chair where the testator had signed the will; because the evidence unequivocally established that the testator could not have seen the witnesses sign the will if the testator desired to do so, any presumption of proper execution arising from the will's attestation clause was rebutted by clear proof that the will was not properly executed in that the witnesses did not sign the will in the testator's presence. McCormick v. Jeffers, 281 Ga. 264, 637 S.E.2d 666 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signature of witnesses in each others' presence.</b> - It is not necessary that the subscribing witnesses sign in the presence of each other; it is sufficient if each signs in the presence of the testator. Whitfield v. Pitts, 205 Ga. 259, 53 S.E.2d 549 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testator and witnesses in adjoining rooms.</b> - If the situation and circumstances of the testator and the attesting witnesses to a will at the time of the will's attestation are such that the testator, in the testator's actual position, might have seen the act of attestation, the requirement of the law that the witnesses shall sign in the testator's presence is sufficiently met. Glenn v. Mann, 234 Ga. 194, 214 S.E.2d 911 (1975) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Subscribing witnesses can attest a will, even though the witnesses and the testator are in adjoining rooms in the same house, if the testator in the testator's actual location might have seen the attestation. Newton v. Palmour, 245 Ga. 603, 266 S.E.2d 208 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signatures not required to be on same page.</b> - Provisions of the code regarding signing and attestation of a will do not require that the signatures of the testator and of the witnesses be on the same page and such a requirement is not imposed by case law. In re Estate of Brannon, 264 Ga. 84, 441 S.E.2d 248 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When all of the signature pages are physically connected as part of the will, the fact that a testator's signature and the signatures of witnesses do not appear on the same page does not in itself invalidate the execution of the will. In re Estate of Brannon, 264 Ga. 84, 441 S.E.2d 248 (1994) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Priority of signatures.</b> - Rules of construction as laid down in Duffie v. Corridon, 40 Ga. 122 (1869), Brooks v. Woodson, 87 Ga. 379, 13 S.E. 712 (1890) and those cases following, that witnesses attest a testator's signature and that a will is rendered invalid if a witness signs before the testator no matter whether the signatures are affixed in the same continuous transaction, are rationalizations opposing the effectuation of testamentary desires while offering no preventative for fraud. They will no longer be followed because there can be no fraud when all parties sit at the same table and affix their signatures in the presence of each other regardless of who signs first. Waldrep v. Goodwin, 230 Ga. 1, 195 S.E.2d 432 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though witnesses attest to the will as declared by the testator and no priority of signature of testator and witnesses should be assigned in the execution of a will, the requirement that the testator must sign or acknowledge the testator's signature in the presence of the witnesses is not eliminated.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Witness also signing as notary.</b> - It was error to grant summary judgment to a caveator in a will contest in which the first of three witnesses signed both as a witness and as a notary. Even if the first witness did not intend to act as a witness, if the first witness and a second witness signed the will in the decedent's presence, then O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20(b), requiring two witnesses, was satisfied even if a third witness signed outside the decedent's presence; furthermore, although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 45-17-8(c)(1) disqualified a witness from also acting as a notary, the first witness's disqualification as a notary was immaterial because the will was not a self-proving one requiring a notary.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements of statute met.</b> - Will met the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20(b) because the will was executed by the testator and signed by two subscribing witnesses, the one surviving witness testified as to the will's due execution, and the caveators presented no evidence challenging the validity of the signatures or the testator's capacity.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Codicil not properly executed.</b> - Trial court erred in finding that a codicil to a testator's will was valid because the propounders failed to prove due execution of the codicil when the testator failed to sign or acknowledge the testator's signature on the first codicil in the presence of at least, and possibly both, subscribing witnesses pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-20(b); the testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses was unequivocal that the testator did not sign the first codicil in the witness's presence and did not acknowledge the testator's signature.

<p class="p4"><b>Question as to whether requirements of attestation were met.</b> - In a brother's action to probate a will, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the sister because a question of fact for a jury existed as to whether the testimony from the witnesses, and the presence of the witnesses' initials on each page along with the testator's signature met the requirement for attestation.

<p class="p4"><b>Propounder of will must prima facie prove factum of will.</b> - When the court charged the substance of the provisions of the statute for the attestation of wills, it was not error, without request, to fail to charge the jury the exact language of the statute. Middleton v. Waters, 205 Ga. 847, 55 S.E.2d 359 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a proceeding to probate a will the burden is upon the propounder to prima facie prove the factum of the will, that is, that the will was executed with requisite formalities; that the testator executed the will freely and voluntarily, and was at the time of sound and disposing mind and memory. This burden carried, the onus of proving the will is not valid for one of the reasons alleged in the caveat shifts to the caveator. Bianchini v. Wilson, 220 Ga. 816, 141 S.E.2d 889 (1965) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The propounder of a will carries the burden of proving a prima facie case by presenting the subscribing competent witnesses who testified that the testator signed the will in their presence, after the will had been read, and that the testator possessed the mentality to know what the testator was doing. Waters v. Arrendale, 223 Ga. 617, 157 S.E.2d 289 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-301).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof.</b> - Trial court did not err in finding that a codicil to a testator's will was invalid because the court properly charged the jury that the caveators had no burden to prove the grounds of their caveats to the propounders' petition to probate codicils; because testamentary capacity and voluntary execution were necessary elements of the propounders' case, the burden of persuasion remained on the propounders to prove their assertions by a preponderance of the evidence, and in the absence of an asserted affirmative defense, the caveators had no duty to affirmatively prove anything but were required only to come forward with evidence to rebut the propounders' prima facie case as to essential elements.

<p class="p4"><b>Statute requires that a testator have knowledge of the contents of the will</b> at the time of execution, not that the testator recall the contents at some subsequent time.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to have will read back insufficient as proof of lack of knowledge.</b> - When a will was written as directed by the testator, and the evidence shows that the testator wishes were carefully and thoroughly discussed in the process and expressed in the will, the fact that the will was not read back to the testator after the will was written, in the absence of any other evidence that the testator did not know the contents of the will, is ineffective as showing a lack of knowledge on the part of the testator. Whitfield v. Pitts, 205 Ga. 259, 53 S.E.2d 549 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-305).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>"Clear and convincing evidence" not required.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-42 contained no "clear and convincing evidence" standard of proof of the testator's knowledge of the will's contents. Lowe v. Young, 260 Ga. 890, 400 S.E.2d 619 (1991) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-42).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Scrivener's testimony.</b> - When there was evidence that the will was read to the testator - who was mentally alert, coherent, able to speak and respond to questions - and that the testator verbally assented to the will, the fact that this was the scrivener's testimony did not vitiate the evidence, but merely went to the evidence's credibility, which was a jury issue.

<p class="p4"><b>Location of signature.</b> - Even though the testator did not sign the last page of the will relating to the disposition of the testator's estate, the will was valid since the testator's signature appeared on the next page, the self-proving affidavit. Hickox v. Wilson, 269 Ga. 180, 496 S.E.2d 711 (1998) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40.1) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56 to will caveators in a will propounder's action seeking to probate a decedent's will since the decedent had sufficiently signed the will on the signature line of the self-proving clause, pursuant to former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40.1, and there existed two competent witness signatures which were sufficient for attestation purposes; accordingly, the statutory requirements for proper execution of a will under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40 appeared to have been met and a jury issue was raised as to whether, in fact, the requirements were met. Miles v. Bryant, 277 Ga. 362, 589 S.E.2d 86 (2003) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-40.1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Admission of self-proved will.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-24(c), when a will is self-proved, it "may be admitted to probate without the testimony of any subscribing witness." In fact, compliance with the requirements of execution are presumed without the live testimony or affidavits of witnesses; that is, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-21(a), the affidavit creates a presumption regarding the prima facie case, subject to rebuttal.

<p class="p4">Self-proving affidavit attached to a testator's will created a rebuttable presumption that the signature and attestation requirements were met and allowed the will to be admitted into evidence without the testimony of the witnesses to the will or other proof that the formalities for the will's execution were met. Duncan v. Moore, 275 Ga. 656, 571 S.E.2d 771 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a sister's challenge to her brother's will, the probate court erred in finding that the will was not sufficiently proven due to the executor's failure to produce the witnesses; the will had an attached self-proving affidavit and could be admitted without other proof that formalities of execution were met, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-24.

<p class="p4">Ruling upholding the 2010 will was affirmed because subscribing witnesses stated in an affidavit that the testatrix was mentally competent when the will was executed, it was self-proved, and contained an affidavit complying with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-24, which created a presumption that the will was executed with the requisite testamentary formalities, including that the testatrix had sufficient mental capacity to do so, and the challenger failed to rebut that presumption.

<p class="p4"><b>No express written contract found.</b> - Because the only references to mutuality in a joint will under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-31 were in the title of the instrument and in the attestation clause, those references were insufficient to constitute either an "express statement" required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-51 or an express written "contract" requirement of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-30, and there was no clear and definite agreement so as to trigger the fraud exception; accordingly, the surviving wife's deed of gift of real property to a nephew was not precluded, and the will was revocable because there was no express written contract to the contrary. Hodges v. Callaway, 279 Ga. 789, 621 S.E.2d 428 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Decedent's son, grandson, and friend did not prove a written will contract meeting the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-30 because handwritten memorandum discovered after the decedent's death did not reflect the consideration the son, grandson, and friend described as part of the will contract and did not embody any promise on the decedent's part, but the notes simply stated the decedent's wishes as to the disposal of property and the handling of the estate; the signature is, in fact, a mandatory statutory requirement under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-30.

<p class="p4">Decedent's son, grandson, and friend did not prove a written will contract meeting the requirements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-30 because the decedent's 2000 will could not be relied upon to satisfy O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-30 since it was not a written contract promising to make a will for valuable consideration and was revoked upon the decedent's execution of a will in 2004; the 2000 will was a revocable will reflecting the decedent's testamentary intent at the time the decedent executed the will, and the decedent changed the testamentary intent when the decedent executed the 2004 will.

<p class="p4"><b>Joint and mutual will.</b> - Trial court did not err when the court concluded that the will of a husband and wife was joint and mutual and that the husband and wife had an enforceable contract not to revoke that will because the husband and wife each agreed to give the other certain described real and personal property as valuable consideration if one or the other survived, and they also agreed that if they died simultaneously, or at the survivor's death, that the residue of the estate would go to their four children, all of whom were biologically the husband's children and two of whom were biologically the wife's children; when the husband died the wife, as the survivor, benefitted from the joint and mutual will when she probated it as the husband's last will and testament and conveyed the husband's entire estate to herself.

Smith v. Turner, 223 Ga. App. 371, 477 S.E.2d 663 (1996) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Agreements to make wills are not established merely because two persons simultaneously make reciprocal testamentary dispositions in favor of each other, when the language of such wills contain nothing to the effect that the instruments are the result of a contract. Webb v. Smith, 220 Ga. 809, 141 S.E.2d 899 (1965), for comment, see 2 Ga. St. B.J. 258 (1965) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-104). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fact that separate wills, with reciprocal provisions, have been executed by two persons simultaneously, or about the same time, is not of itself evidence of a contract between the testators, but such a contract may appear from the terms of the will, by direct reference or by inference. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Leaptrot, 225 Ga. 783, 171 S.E.2d 555 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-104). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ample consideration for a husband's promise to devise property to his wife for life, provision to be made for a third person upon the death of the testator, is found in the promise of the wife to make a similar testamentary distribution on her part, when the proof is ample that the wife had property of her own. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Leaptrot, 225 Ga. 783, 171 S.E.2d 555 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Simultaneous execution of wills containing reciprocal dispositions.</b> - General rule is that, if two persons execute wills at the same time, either by one or two instruments, making reciprocal dispositions in favor of each other, the mere execution of such wills does not impose such a legal obligation as will prevent revocation. Webb v. Smith, 220 Ga. 809, 141 S.E.2d 899 (1965), for comment, see 2 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Impact of divorce on mutual wills.</b> - When the wills which the propounder and the testator made were mutual wills, then the revocation of the propounder's will by marriage would have revoked the other mutual will. King v. Bennett, 215 Ga. 345, 110 S.E.2d 772 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-104). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A will made pursuant to an agreement between a husband and wife, and incorporated into the divorce decree between them, can be revoked by a subsequent will. Jones v.

<p class="p4"><b>No express statement of mutual wills.</b> - Under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-51(b), as there was no express statement in both spouses' wills that the wills were mutual wills, the existence of mutual wills could not be established. Bandy v. Henderson, 284 Ga. 692, 670 S.E.2d 792 (2008) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-51).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Interposition of equity necessary to prevent fraud where mutual wills based on valid contract.</b> - When the mutual wills are the result of a contract based upon a valid consideration, and when, after the death of one of the parties, the survivor has accepted benefits under the will of the other which was executed pursuant to an agreement, equity will interpose to prevent fraud. This can be accomplished only through a court of equity, as the probate court has no jurisdiction to enforce such agreement. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Leaptrot, 225 Ga. 783, 171 S.E.2d 555 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Existence and proof of contract required to invoke intervention of equity.</b> - To enable one to invoke the intervention of equity, it is not sufficient that there are wills simultaneously made, and similar in their reciprocal provisions; but the existence of a clear and definite contract must be alleged and proved, either by evidence of an express agreement, or by unequivocal circumstances. Webb v. Smith, 220 Ga. 809, 141 S.E.2d 899 (1965) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-104); Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v.

<p class="p4"><b>No revocation.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a widow's motion for summary judgment affirming an order admitting a decedent's 2001 will to probate as the 2001 will was not expressly revoked since there was no evidence of a subsequent will or other written instrument that was executed, subscribed, and attested with the same formality as a will, which contained a statement expressly revoking earlier wills; there was no implied revocation of the 2001 will since an implied revocation by a subsequent inconsistent will would take effect only when a subsequent will became operative, and then was only effective as to inconsistencies between the later testamentary instrument and an earlier testamentary instrument, so the subsequent inconsistent will had to be a written document, and there was no written subsequent inconsistent will. Harper v. Harper, 281 Ga. 25, 635 S.E.2d 711 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intentional obliteration of pertinent parts of will operates as revocation.</b> - If testator, three years after the execution of a will, took a pen and obliterated the pertinent and material parts thereof, canceling the will and expressing the testator's intention in this respect, then the will was no longer effective, and when testator died the will was just so much paper. Cummings v. Cummings, 89 Ga. App. 529, 80 S.E.2d 204 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-401).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Cancellation of material part of will raises presumption of revocation.</b> - When a paper found among a decedent's papers is offered for probate as a will, and appears to have been canceled or obliterated in a material part, a presumption arises that the cancellations or obliterations were made by the deceased, and that the deceased intended the papers to operate as a revocation.

<p class="p4"><b>No revocation.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a widow's motion for summary judgment affirming an order admitting a decedent's 2001 will to probate as the 2001 will was not expressly revoked since there was no evidence of a subsequent will or other written instrument that was executed, subscribed, and attested with the same formality as a will, which contained a statement expressly revoking earlier wills; there was no implied revocation of the 2001 will since an implied revocation by a subsequent inconsistent will would take effect only when a subsequent will became operative, and then was only effective as to inconsistencies between the later testamentary instrument and an earlier testamentary instrument, so the subsequent inconsistent will had to be a written document, and there was no written subsequent inconsistent will.

<p class="p4"><b>Implied revocation.</b> - When the testator makes a different disposition of certain personal property bequeathed by the later will, this constitutes a revocation of the item as to this property in the former will. Cummings v. Cummings, 89 Ga. App. 529, 80 S.E.2d 204 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-402). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the testator gave a ring to the testator's son by will, the testator could revoke the bequest either by conveying the ring and giving the ring to another prior to the testator's death, so that the ring did not remain a part of the testator's estate when the testator died, or the testator could revoke this bequest in the will, or revoke the entire will. Cummings v. Cummings, 89 Ga. App. 529, 80 S.E.2d 204 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-402). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>"Material" obliteration.</b> - Obliteration of the names of two of the four beneficiaries, whom the testator designated were to take "equally, share and share alike, per stirpes," was material because the obliteration directly affected the distribution of all property in the estate.

<p class="p6"><b>1. Presumption of Revocation</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of intent to revoke inferred from cancellation of material parts of will.</b> - When an instrument found among a decedent's papers was offered for probate as decedent's will, and appeared to have been canceled or obliterated by marks drawn diagonally across certain material items thereof, the obliteration of which affected the testamentary scheme, a presumption arose that such cancellations or obliterations were made by the deceased, and that the deceased intended the markings to operate as a total revocation of the will. Singleton v. Shewmake, 184 Ga. 785, 193 S.E. 232 (1917) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404); King v. Bennett, 215 Ga. 345, 110 S.E.2d 772 (1959);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a will has been canceled or obliterated in a material part, a presumption of revocation arises, and the burden is on the propounder to show that no revocation was intended. Langan v. Cheshire, 208 Ga. 107, 65 S.E.2d 415 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>From destruction or cancellation of duplicate will.</b> - Statements made in the handwriting of the deceased on the margin of a will opposite items obliterated or canceled, designating a contrary disposition of the property covered by such items, would tend to support the presumption of law that the material obliterations or cancellations were made by the testator for the purpose of revoking the will. Singleton v. Shewmake, 184 Ga. 785, 193 S.E. 232 (1917) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3919). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a testator who has executed a will in duplicate cancels or destroys one of the duplicates, the presumption is that the testator meant thereby to revoke the will. King v. Bennett, 215 Ga. 345, 110 S.E.2d 772 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute plainly indicates that, when there has been a multiple execution of a will, the destruction of one of the executed copies by the maker of the will with intention to revoke the will has the effect of revoking all of the copies, and the same presumption of intention to revoke arises from the destruction of one of the duplicates as would arise if the destroyed copy were the only one. King v. Bennett, 215 Ga. 345, 110 S.E.2d 772 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the will when found among the papers of the testator was torn in four pieces, with the signature torn from the will, and missing, this certainly shows the will's cancellation in a material portion, the signature of a will being essential to the will's validity. This evidence of the condition of the original will, which was in the custody of the testator until the testator's death, and found among the testator's papers shortly after the testator's death, raised a presumption that the cancellation was done by the testator and that the testator intended to revoke the will. King v. Bennett, 215 Ga. 345, 110 S.E.2d 772 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a will contest the cross-propounders, in seeking to probate a copy of a material portion of a will, the original of which portion they asserted had been destroyed, had the burden of overcoming the presumption that the destruction had been done by the testator personally with the intention to revoke, and the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the burden rested on the cross-propounders to prove that the copy offered by them was in substance and intent the same as the original. Sheffield v. Sheffield, 215 Ga. 546, 111 S.E.2d 218 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption that testator made cancellations or obliterations.</b> - When the paper is found among the testator's effects, there is also a presumption that the testator made the cancellations or obliterations. Ellis v. O'Neal, 175 Ga. 652, 165 S.E. 751 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3919); Carter v.

<p class="p4">When there is no direct or circumstantial evidence that alterations in a will were made after the execution of the will, it must be presumed that the alterations were made by the testator, if the will was in the testator's custody until the time of the testator's death. Jordan v. Hayes, 225 Ga. 697, 171 S.E.2d 496 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When there is no contention that alterations in an instrument were not made by the maker of the instrument, and there is no evidence that the alterations were made subsequently to the instrument's signing, the presumption of law is that the alterations were made prior to the signing.

<p class="p6"><b>2. Proof Required to Rebut Presumption</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof required to rebut presumption of revocation generally.</b> - When there was no dispute as to the cancellation of material parts of the will and as to written declarations by the testator declaring the testator's will ineffective and no evidence to indicate that the testator intended to revoke only the canceled items, the statutory presumption as to a revocation of the entire will was not rebutted. Singleton v. Shewmake, 184 Ga. 785, 193 S.E. 232 (1917) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3919). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Presumption of revocation may be rebutted, among other ways, by proof that a will was lost or destroyed prior to the death of the testator without the testator's consent, and that, when evidence to such effect is submitted, the question whether the presumption has been overcome is for determination by the jury, in view of all of the evidence and circumstances in the case, and the credibility attributed by the jury to the witnesses. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judge may instruct the jury to the effect that the presumption in favor of revocation may be rebutted by showing that the will was not destroyed by the testator, or that if the testator did destroy the will, the testator did not thereby intend to revoke the will; provided only that such an instruction, like others, must be supported by sufficient evidence. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Presumption must be rebutted by evidence showing the obliterations and cancellations were not done with the intent to revoke the whole will. Howard v.

<p class="p4">When the revocation of a will must be presumed because of the will's destruction in a material part, declarations of the testator are admissible to support or rebut the presumption that the destruction was the act of the testator with the intention to revoke. King v. Bennett, 215 Ga. 345, 110 S.E.2d 772 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of revocation not raised.</b> - In a suit asserting undue influence and seeking revocation of a testator's will, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on the issue of revocation during the presentation of the plaintiff's case-in-chief because, under the change set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-44 from O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-74, the obliteration involved in the case, not being made on the original will, did not raise the presumption of revocation. Since the presumption was essential to the plaintiff's claim of revocation, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on that claim. Morrison v. Morrison, 282 Ga. 866, 655 S.E.2d 571 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Will not revoked by cancelling portions.</b> - Testator only indicated a desire to cancel certain portions of the testator's will, but the testator did not indicate an intent to revoke the will; the testator struck through the names of all successor beneficiaries of a trust estate as well as language nominating a certain person as a successor trustee, the testator initialed these struck through parts, and the testator named a certain person as the testator's successor beneficiary, but the testator made no other changes to the will.

<p class="p6"><b>3. Burden of Proof</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute places burden of proof on propounder to rebut presumption of revocation.</b> - When alterations appear on the face of a will, and other alterations on portions of the will which have previously been incorporated in a codicil, the alterations are material as regards the codicil, since the alterations concern the very purpose and subject matter of the codicil, but if the alterations and obliterations not incorporated by, and later to, the codicil were not intended as a revocation of the codicil, the burden was on the propounders to show that fact. Langan v. Cheshire, 208 Ga. 107, 65 S.E.2d 415 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Burden is placed upon the propounder to rebut the presumption with evidence showing no intention to revoke. Howard v. Cotton, 223 Ga. 118, 153 S.E.2d 557 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As a general rule, the burden is on a person attacking a paper offered for probate as a will to sustain the grounds of the propounder's attack. But by express provision, when a will has been canceled or obliterated in a material part, a presumption of revocation arises, and the burden is on the propounder to show that no revocation was intended.

<p class="p6"><b>4. Doctrine of Dependent Relative Revocation</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of dependent relative revocation.</b> - Doctrine of dependent relative revocation (conditional revocation) is a doctrine of presumed intention, and has grown up as a result of an effort which courts always make to arrive at the real intention of the testator. Carter v. First United Methodist Church, 246 Ga. 352, 271 S.E.2d 493 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rebuttal by propounder shifts burden of proof to caveator.</b> - Evidence that old will, with pencil lines drawn through property disposition provisions, was found among testator's personal papers folded together with later writing making a somewhat different disposition of the testator's property was some evidence tending to establish that the cancellation and the making of a new will were parts of one scheme, and the revocation of the old will was so related to the making of the new as to be dependent upon it; this evidence was sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption of revocation and to give rise to a presumption in favor of the propounder under the doctrine of dependent relative revocation or conditional revocation, thus shifting the burden of proof to the caveator to prove, in essence, that decedent would have preferred intestacy. Carter v. First United Methodist Church, 246 Ga. 352, 271 S.E.2d 493 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No presumption canceled will preferred instead of intestacy.</b> - No mere presumption that the testator would have preferred canceled will instead of intestacy will be allowed to defeat testator's intention when it has been made to appear. Carter v. First United Methodist Church, 246 Ga. 352, 271 S.E.2d 493 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-404).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to apply doctrine of dependent relative revocation.</b> - Trial court did not err by failing to apply the doctrine of dependent relative revocation to revive the decedent's 1988 will because based on the attorney's trial testimony, the trial court properly found that the markings on the original 1988 will that the decedent brought to a June 2004 meeting with the attorney were so extensive that it could not be determined, even by an experienced lawyer, what decedent intended to remove and what, if anything, was intended to remain.

<p class="p4"><b>Unattested statements in will lack formality required to revoke.</b> - While statements made in the handwriting of the deceased on the margin of will opposite items obliterated or canceled, designating a contrary disposition of the property covered by such items, but unattested, as well as a general unattested statement written on the cover of the will declaring that the will was to be ineffective, and indicating a different testamentary scheme, would not operate as an express revocation in writing of the will, such declarations made in the handwriting of the testator would tend to support presumption of law that the material obliterations or cancellations were made by the testator for the purpose of revoking the will. Singleton v. Shewmake, 184 Ga. 785, 193 S.E. 232 (1917) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3918).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">While revocation of a will cannot be established by proof of parol declarations by the testator, a clause in a later written instrument, properly executed by the testator, expressly revoking a former will is not rendered ineffective merely by the loss or destruction of the instrument which contains it, and proof of the revocation clause in a later lost or destroyed will may be made by parol.

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Will lost before testator's death.</b> - Plain meaning of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-6 was that when a will was lost before the death of the testator, a copy may not be probated. Woods v. Giedd, 257 Ga. 152, 356 S.E.2d 211 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Issue of fact as to when will lost.</b> - Genuine issue of fact as to whether a will was in a safe-deposit box at the time the box was opened, and thus could have been lost after the testator's death, precluded summary judgment against the propounders of an unsigned copy of the will. Woods v. Giedd, 257 Ga. 152, 356 S.E.2d 211 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section exhaustive.</b> - There is no law for probating a copy of a will, except when the will has been lost or destroyed after the death of the testator, or without the testator's consent, under this statute. Godwin v. Godwin, 129 Ga. 67, 58 S.E. 652 (1907) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3289).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carbon copy of will may be probated as original will.</b> - When the document sought to be probated was a carbon copy, but it was executed with the same formality as the original will at the same time, and its provisions were identical with those of the original will, and the propounder seeks to probate it as an original will, and not as the copy of a lost or destroyed will, it should properly be admitted to probate, unless it was revoked by the testator during the testator's lifetime. King v. Bennett, 215 Ga. 345, 110 S.E.2d 772 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proof Required</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standard of proof.</b> - "Preponderance of the evidence" is the correct standard applied to overcome the presumption of revocation when an original will cannot be produced. Warner v. Reynolds, 273 Ga. 802, 546 S.E.2d 520 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof required to probate copy of destroyed or lost will.</b> - In order to probate an alleged copy of a lost or destroyed will, it is necessary to prove, among other things, that the copy is in substance and intent the same as the original. Woodruff v. Woodruff, 182 Ga. 895, 187 S.E. 391 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When cross-propounders contended that certain items of the will as originally executed by the testator had been deleted, changed, and destroyed, and sought to set up, establish, and probate what the cross-propounders contended to be a true copy of these items of the will as originally executed by the testator, the burden rested upon the cross-propounders of proving that the copy was in substance and intent the same as the original, and it was error for the court to fail to so instruct the jury. Nassau v. Sheffield, 211 Ga. 66, 84 S.E.2d 4 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a will was duly executed, and when propounded for probate it appears that certain provisions thereof have been changed, altered, or destroyed by a third person without the knowledge or consent of the testator, and it can be shown by the will itself, or by extrinsic evidence, what such stricken or destroyed provisions were, they can be restored, and the will as originally executed admitted to probate. Nassau v. Sheffield, 211 Ga. 66, 84 S.E.2d 4 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of execution not limited to testimony of subscribing witnesses.</b> - Provision of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611, as to clear proof "by the subscribing witnesses and other evidence" no more limits proof of the execution of a will to the testimony of the subscribing witnesses than did former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602, relating to probate in solemn form. Since former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611 as to probate of a copy follows the procedure for probating an original will, except that it adds the clear-proof rule, there was no error in giving in charge the basic<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rule of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-601. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Self-proving affidavit.</b> - Proof of the execution of a will in case of probate in solemn form and proof of the execution of a will in a case to establish and probate a copy where the will is missing may be made in precisely the same manner and by the same character of evidence; and in both evidence other than the testimony of the subscribing witnesses, after the available witnesses have been produced at the hearing, is admissible for the purpose of proving the execution of the will, and in each this may be done despite the testimony of the witnesses against the will. Fletcher v. Gillespie, 201 Ga. 377, 40 S.E.2d 45 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statutory provision that the copy of a missing will be "clearly proved to be such by the subscribing witnesses and other evidence" does not limit proof of the execution of a will to the testimony of the subscribing witnesses. Fletcher v. Gillespie, 201 Ga. 377, 40 S.E.2d 45 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a will contest case where the testator's niece contested a will including her own daughter as a beneficiary, the later lost or destroyed will could be validated under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-6(a) by uncontroverted evidence from the notary public who notarized the affidavit regarding the execution by the testator of a self-proving affidavit. Westmoreland v. Tallent, 274 Ga. 172, 549 S.E.2d 113 (2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof provided to admit copy.</b> - Probate court properly admitted a copy of a will for probate because the propounding executor had rebutted the presumption of revocation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46 with evidence of a trust agreement that was named in the will and by evidence of prior wills, which showed a consistent testamentary scheme.

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of revocation generally.</b> - In every case when it is sought to have admitted to probate and record a copy of a lost or destroyed will in lieu of the original, the propounder is confronted with the presumption that the will was revoked by the testator. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a will contest the cross-propounders, in seeking to probate a copy of a material portion of a will, the original of which portion the cross-propounders asserted had been destroyed, had the burden of overcoming the presumption that the destruction had been done by the testator personally with the intention to revoke, and the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the burden rested on the cross-propounders to prove that the copy offered by the cross-propounders was in substance and intent the same as the original. Sheffield v. Sheffield, 215 Ga. 546, 111 S.E.2d 218 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When a will was lost,</b> the presumption arose that the will was revoked, the trial court erred as a matter of law when the court held that there must first be evidence of the condition of the will before the presumption is raised. Horton v. Burch, 267 Ga. 1, 471 S.E.2d 879 (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of prior will found.</b> - Trial court properly determined that a decedent's 1998 will was revoked as the executor, who filed the will for probate, failed to rebut the presumption of revocation since the original was never found and evidence was presented that the decedent altered and made changes to the 1998 will based on consulting an attorney to make a new one and having two copies showing alterations and changes indicated on the copies. Mincey v. Deckle, 283 Ga. 579, 662 S.E.2d 126 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements not satisfied for intent to revoke.</b> - It was error for the superior court to direct a verdict in favor of a propounder because under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46, the propounder was required to prove that the propounder's mother did not deliberately discard or destroy the original of the will with the purpose of revoking the will, but the propounder did not satisfy the propounder's statutory duty, and the propounder should have filed a petition to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original, which would have notified the probate court of the appropriate standards and burdens of proof; the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46(b) clearly requires that the presumption of intent to revoke be rebutted in order for a copy of a will to be probated, and Georgia law does not allow a propounder to probate a will without fulfilling the pertinent evidentiary requirements, even when no caveat has been filed. Tudor v. Bradford, 289 Ga. 28, 709 S.E.2d 235 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Rebuttal</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute is awkwardly expressed,</b> but, properly construed, the words "in every such case" refer to every case wherein it is sought to have admitted to probate and record a copy of a lost or destroyed will in lieu of an original; and therefore, when it is sought to prove and establish a will not to be found at the death of the testator, the propounder is confronted with the presumption that the will was revoked by the testator, and that presumption must be rebutted by proof. Harris v. Camp, 138 Ga. 752, 76 S.E. 40 (1912) ??? (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3863).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Method of rebutting presumption of revocation.</b> - On the trial of an application for the probate of a copy of an alleged lost will, the declaration of an heir of the decedent, to the effect that an original will had existed and that the heir had destroyed the will, is not, unless the declarant be a party to the proceeding, admissible in evidence in favor of the propounders. Under such circumstances, the declaration is mere hearsay and is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of revocation. Scott v. Maddox, 113 Ga. 795, 39 S.E. 500, 84 Am. St. R. 263 (1901) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3289). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the statute is awkwardly expressed, the rule is that a universal presumption of revocation may be rebutted in a number of ways: first, by proof that the will was lost or destroyed subsequently to the death of the testator; or, second, the presumption of revocation may be overcome by showing that the will was destroyed prior to death, provided however it will be also shown, for example, that the testator did not have possession of the instrument after the instrument's execution, or that while the will was still in existence the testator had lost the testator's testamentary capacity to annul the will, and that such mental incapacity continued up to the time of the testator's death. Saliba v. Saliba, 201 Ga. 577, 40 S.E.2d 511 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Presumption of revocation may be rebutted, among other ways, by proof that a will was lost or destroyed prior to the death of the testator without the testator's consent, and that, when evidence to such effect is submitted, the question whether the presumption has been overcome is for determination by the jury, in view of all of the evidence and circumstances in the case, and the credibility attributed by the jury to the witnesses. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Declarations of the testator are admissible in evidence</b> either to support or to rebut the presumption of revocation, although made at any time between the making of the will and the death of the testator, and although the declarations are not shown to have accompanied any particular act of revocation or attempted revocation; their admissibility not depending upon res gestae. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611); Jackson v. Lamb, 121 Ga. App. 44, 172 S.E.2d 449 (1970);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of revocation may be rebutted by circumstantial evidence</b> as well as by direct evidence, and the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a will were relevant for the purpose of showing that the testator had made a will that would inure to the benefit of the propounder, infant child of the testator's deceased brother; and also as showing circumstances tending to illustrate the probability or improbability of later revoking such will. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Rebuttal of the presumption of revocation of a will when only a copy is found could be made by circumstantial as well as by direct evidence, and when the direct evidence traces a will into the custody of the testator and there stops, it seems that the propounder can only assert that whatever may have happened to the will after the will's delivery to the testator, the testator did not revoke the will, and then submit circumstantial evidence, including declarations of the testator, if any, in support of such assertion. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Existence of sufficient rebuttal is question for jury.</b> - Contents of the will must be proved and the presumption of revocation by the testator, which is raised by the latter clause of this statute be rebutted by such evidence as clearly satisfies the conscience of the jury, but this may be done by the subscribing witnesses, or any other competent testimony. Kitchens v. Kitchens, 39 Ga. 168, 99 Am. Dec. 453 (1869) (decided under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2396) Mosely v. Carr, 70 Ga. 333 (1883) See also Burge v. Hamilton, 72 Ga. 568 (1884) (decided under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2431); Gillis v. Gillis, 96 Ga. 1, 23 S.E. 107, 51 Am. St. R. 121, 30 L.R.A. 143 (1895); Harris v. Camp, 138 Ga. 752, 76 S.E. 40 (1912) (decided under Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2431);(decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3289);(decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3863). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Superior court erred in instructing the jury in a suit to probate a copy of a will, that, if the jury believes the alleged testator did not intentionally destroy the testator's will, then the form of their verdict would be, "We, the jury, find in favor of the will;" the error being that the case could not be concluded in favor of the propounder by a mere finding that the testator did not intentionally revoke the testator's will, but, over and beyond that, it would be necessary to find that the propounder had clearly proved the alleged copy "to be such." Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judge may instruct the jury to the effect that the presumption in favor of revocation may be rebutted by showing that the will was not destroyed by the testator, or that if the testator did destroy the will, the testator did not thereby intend to revoke the will; provided only that such an instruction, like others, must be supported by sufficient evidence. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 791, 44 S.E.2d 744 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Whether or not the presumption is rebutted by the evidence offered by the propounder is for the determination of the jury. Williams v. Swint, 239 Ga. 66, 235 S.E.2d 489 (1977) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When evidence is submitted by a proponent of a will in an attempt to overcome a presumption of revocation, the question whether the presumption has been overcome is for determination by the jury in view of all the evidence and circumstances in the case, and the credibility attributed by the jury to the witnesses. Williams v. Swint, 239 Ga. 66, 235 S.E.2d 489 (1977) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-611). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Question of whether the propounders carried the burden of overcoming the presumption that the original will was revoked was for the jury, and in reviewing the jury verdict, the evidence must be accepted which is most favorable to the party in whose favor the verdict was rendered. Hill v. Cochran, 258 Ga. 473, 371 S.E.2d 94 (1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Presumption not rebutted.</b> - Testator's fiance failed to rebut the presumption that the testator destroyed and intended to revoke the testator's original will created by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46(a) although the testator's relationship with the testator's daughter was strained because the testator had control of the will, the lock box in which the will was kept had been broken into, and the testator had expressed dissatisfaction with the testator's fiance. Britt v. Sands, 294 Ga. 426, 754 S.E.2d 58 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err by failing to apply the doctrine of dependent relative revocation to revive the decedent's 1988 will because based on the attorney's trial testimony, the trial court properly found that the markings on the original 1988 will that the decedent brought to a June 2004 meeting with the attorney were so extensive that it could not be determined, even by an experienced lawyer, what the decedent intended to remove and what, if anything, was intended to remain.

<p class="p4">This section carries forward the portions of former OCGA Sec. 53-2-76 that relate to the marriage of the testator and the birth of a child to the testator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This section indicates that the provisions apply in the event of the birth of a posthumous child within ten months of the testator's death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This section also clarifies that the adoption of a child by the testator has the same effect as the birth of a child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the will contemplates the marriage or birth or adoption, the event will not result in a revocation of the will.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under the presumption that a testator probably would intend to treat after-born or after-adopted children the same as children already born or adopted, the section also states that a will that provides for a class of the testator's children is deemed to be made in contemplation of the birth or adoption of additional members of that class absent an indication of an intent to the contrary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, the subsequent birth or adoption of class members will not result in the revocation of the will.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408, are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language of statute is unambiguous.</b> - It clearly expresses the intention of the legislature that in every case subsequent marriage or birth of a child will revoke a will, unless the will contains a provision which is made in contemplation of such an event. Williams v. Lane, 193 Ga. 306, 18 S.E.2d 481 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of "provision for."</b> - It is incorrect to construe the statute to mean that "provision for" is the equivalent of "in contemplation of." Williams v. Lane, 193 Ga. 306, 18 S.E.2d 481 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Illegal marriage insufficient to revoke will.</b> - No agreement purporting to constitute a common-law marriage, nor cohabitation of the man and woman while holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife, nor birth of children to such parties, will constitute or prove a common-law marriage between them, when the man was legally married to another woman throughout the period of such cohabitation and relationship. Consequently, a will written by the purported wife during the cohabitation was revoked by her subsequent valid marriage to the purported husband after his divorce from his first wife. Williams v. Lane, 193 Ga. 306, 18 S.E.2d 481 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When the evidence was in conflict as to whether there had been a previous marriage, the trial court was authorized to find that there had not and, therefore, that the ceremonial marriage between the testator and the caveator was valid so as to cause the revocation of the testator's will.

<p class="p4"><b>Will revoked unless provision made for after-born child.</b> - Fact that the testator may have lived some time after the birth of the child, and failed to make any change in the testator's will, can make no difference. The will is void immediately upon the birth of the child, and nothing the testator might do or fail to do could give the will life. The will is dead as completely as if the testator had destroyed the will by burning, or any other means known to the law. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 279, 42 S.E.2d 748 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Son shown to have been born subsequently to the execution of a will is not entitled to recover in ejectment against a purchaser for a valid consideration who relied on the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) probating the will in solemn form, and who purchased prior to any proceeding to set aside such judgment.

<p class="p4">When a proceeding is filed to probate a will which unquestionably has been revoked by the subsequent birth of a child, and no provision has been made in contemplation of that event, and the fact appears on the face of the proceedings, consent by a guardian ad litem that the will be probated is clearly beyond the scope of the guardian's authority, and on a proper application for that purpose the judgment of probate should be set aside. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 279, 42 S.E.2d 748 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Revocation is made to turn, not upon any provision made for the child, but upon whether the testator, by the testator's will, has made a provision for such an event.

McParland, 233 Ga. 458, 211 S.E.2d 748 (1975) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court did not err in finding the testator's will was not made in contemplation of future children and was thus invalidated by the birth of children after the execution of the will because the reference in the will to "my dependents" in the context of directing the personal representative to check on the availability of survivor benefits was insufficient to show that the testator contemplated future-born children as it did not meet the essential basic requirement of showing that the event of future-born children was in the testator's mind at the time the will was executed.

<p class="p4"><b>Adoption equivalent to birth of child.</b> - Antecedent will, which makes no provision in contemplation of an adoption, is revoked by implication or inference of law by the testator' legal adoption of a minor child. The act of adopting a child, under the provisions of the adoption statute of 1941 (Ga. L. 1941, p. 305) as amended by the Act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1157), is the equivalent in law of the birth of a child. Thornton v. Anderson, 207 Ga. 714, 64 S.E.2d 186 (1951), for comment, see 3 Mercer L. Rev. 233 (1951); 14 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Virtual adoption did not result in revocation.</b> - Although an adult child of a testator met most of the requirements for virtual adoption in that the adult child had been raised by the testator as the testator's own, the doctrine of virtual adoption did not apply because the testator had made a will disposing of the testator's estate. Virtual adoption could not result in a revocation of the will under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-48(a) because that statute applied only to legal adoptions, and virtual adoption was a legal fiction arising after the adoptive parent's death.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language of statute is unambiguous.</b> - It clearly expresses the intention of the legislature that in every case subsequent marriage or birth of a child will revoke a will, unless the will contains a provision which is made in contemplation of such an event. Williams v. Lane, 193 Ga. 306, 18 S.E.2d 481 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of "provision for."</b> - It is incorrect to construe the statute to mean that "provision for" is the equivalent of "in contemplation of." Williams v. Lane, 193 Ga. 306, 18 S.E.2d 481 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

McParland, 233 Ga. 458, 211 S.E.2d 748 (1975) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Illegal marriage insufficient to revoke will.</b> - No agreement purporting to constitute a common-law marriage, nor cohabitation of the man and woman while holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife, nor birth of children to such parties, will constitute or prove a common-law marriage between them, when the man was legally married to another woman throughout the period of such cohabitation and relationship. Consequently, a will written by the purported wife during the cohabitation was revoked by her subsequent valid marriage to the purported husband after his divorce from his first wife. Williams v. Lane, 193 Ga. 306, 18 S.E.2d 481 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When the evidence was in conflict as to whether there had been a previous marriage, the trial court was authorized to find that there had not and, therefore, that the ceremonial marriage between the testator and the caveator was valid so as to cause the revocation of the testator's will.

<p class="p4"><b>Will revoked unless provision made for after-born child.</b> - Fact that the testator may have lived some time after the birth of the child, and failed to make any change in the testator's will, can make no difference. The will is void immediately upon the birth of the child, and nothing the testator might do or fail to do could give the will life. The will is dead as completely as if the testator had destroyed the will by burning, or any other means known to the law. Saliba v.

<p class="p4">When a proceeding is filed to probate a will which unquestionably has been revoked by the subsequent birth of a child, and no provision has been made in contemplation of that event, and the fact appears on the face of the proceedings, consent by a guardian ad litem that the will be probated is clearly beyond the scope of the guardian's authority, and on a proper application for that purpose the judgment of probate should be set aside. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 279, 42 S.E.2d 748 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-408). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Rules of construction generally.</b> - Rules applicable in the construction of a will are those established by the laws of Georgia and the decisions of the court, viz.: (a) every will is sui generis; (b) the first object is to find the intent of the testator; (c) such intent is to be derived from a consideration of the will as a whole and read in the light of the circumstances surrounding the will's execution; and (d) it is to be presumed that the testator intended to dispose of the testator's entire estate and not to die intestate as to any part of the testator's estate. Cumming v. Cumming, 219 Ga. 655, 135 S.E.2d 402 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Every will is a thing to itself.</b> It is emphatically not only sui juris but sui generis.

Stringfellow v. Harman, 207 Ga. 62, 60 S.E.2d 139 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Construction of will on ad hoc basis.</b> - Precedents, or adjudged cases, are of but little authority, and of dangerous application, in deciding upon the intention of a testator; the construction depends so much on each case, upon the character of the testator, the terms the testator employs, and all the surrounding circumstances.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intention of testator is primary consideration.</b> - In the construction of wills, the intention of the testator should be the first and great object of inquiry. And this is to be sought for by looking to the whole will, and not to detached parts of the will. Sproull v. Graves, 194 Ga. 66, 20 S.E.2d 613 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806); Whitney v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 214 Ga. 674, 107 S.E.2d 191 (1959); Wolfe v.

<p class="p4"><b>In finding testator's intent,</b> the court is not limited to construing only the residuary clause in question, but may look to "the four corners" of the will to discover the testator's total testamentary disposition. Kirby v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 235 Ga. 205, 219 S.E.2d 112 (1975) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Intentions of a testator are to be derived from a consideration of the testator's will as a whole, read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and are not to be determined by arbitrary conjecture as to what the testator meant nor by consideration of detached portions of the will. Aiken v. Aiken, 209 Ga. 819, 76 S.E.2d 481 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intent of testator is to control.</b> - It is axiomatic in the construction of wills that the intent of the testator as gathered from the entire instrument is to control. If two clauses of a will are so inconsistent that both cannot stand, the latter will prevail; but the whole will is to be taken together, and operation is to be given every part of it, if this can be done without violating its terms or the intention of the testator. And the intention of the testator is to be sought by looking to the whole will rather than to detached parts of the will. Watts v. Finley, 187 Ga. 629, 1 S.E.2d 723 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Intention of the testator is to absolutely control. Not only may the rules of grammar be entirely disregarded in order to carry into effect the manifest intention of the testator, but even well-defined technical terms of the law will be given an unusual meaning, or will be held to be meaningless, when it is clear from the provisions in the will that the testator did not use them in their technical sense, or when, to carry out the testator's intention, it is necessary to entirely disregard such technical terms. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 192 Ga. 754, 16 S.E.2d 743 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In construing a will the court is required to examine the will as a whole and to search diligently for the intention of the testator as the same may be revealed therein. This search for the intention of the testator should be made by two methods: (1) by looking to the will as a whole; and (2) by scrutinizing every phrase that the will contains. Patterson v. Patterson, 208 Ga. 17, 64 S.E.2d 585 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Intention of testator.</b> - Cardinal principle in the interpretation of a will is to give effect to the testator's intention, when it can be ascertained from the will, and when such intention is not incompatible with established rules of law and equity. Bratton v. Trust Co., 191 Ga. 49, 11 S.E.2d 204 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Intention of the testator is imperative on the courts, unless it is in conflict with some established rule of law. If it is, the law is more imperious than the intention, and the latter will yield to the former. The law, though, in order to defeat the intention, must be clearly and decidedly in conflict with it. Lane v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 195 Ga. 828, 25 S.E.2d 800 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Every court must determine for itself what the intention of the testator is in the particular case before the court, and that intention should be carried into effect, provided the intention be not unlawful.

<p class="p4"><b>Courts are without authority to rewrite by construction an unambiguous will;</b> for to do that would be to substitute the will of the court for that of the testator. Hungerford v.

<p class="p4">In order to construe item 14 of the will as the petitioners contend it should be, it would be necessary to make deletions and substitutions in the language of the testator, and this court is not authorized to do this, since the item as written has a logical meaning, consistent with the rules of law, which can be given effect. When the language of a will is clear and can be given legal effect as the will stands, the courts will not, by construction, give the will a different effect. Veal v. King, 216 Ga. 298, 116 S.E.2d 223 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Court should construe to give effect to testator's intent.</b> - If the intention of the testator is clear as it stands, it is the duty of the court to so construe it, regardless of any opinion the court may have as to a different testamentary intention.

<p class="p4">When, the devise apparently passes a fee-simple estate and does so merely because of the absence of an expressed intent as to what character of estate was actually intended to be devised, and in a subsequent provision the property is devised to others at the death of the first devisee, such provisions should be held to grant a life-estate with remainder over, else such subsequent provision must be held to have no meaning. Watts v. Finley, 187 Ga. 629, 1 S.E.2d 723 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">When a provision in a will is clear, certain, and definite in regard to a bequest, a codicil which is not certain and definite, its language being capable of some other reasonable construction, and which makes nonmandatory the terms of the original bequest only as to the specific form of fulfillment, and does not alter the mandatory character of the original bequest as to the will's general purpose, will not work a revocation. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 192 Ga. 754, 16 S.E.2d 743 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Intent of in terrorem clause.</b> - Given a widow's commission of undue influence in procuring a conveyance of beach property to herself and her son, it was not the decedent's intent in including an in terrorem clause to wholly immunize her from the entire amount of attorney's fees incurred by the estate in the undue influence litigation. Her share of the estate, like all the bequests, would be reduced in value after payment of the fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-6(4). Pate v.

<p class="p4">While the intention of a testator cannot be given effect if contrary to express enactments of the legislature or positive rules of property, in the construction of a will the cardinal rule is that the intention of the testator should be the first and great object of inquiry, and this is to be sought for by looking to the whole will, and not to detached parts of the will, and when so ascertained, shall be given effect as far as may be consistent with the rules of law.

<p class="p4"><b>Rights of adopted child a question of testator's intent.</b> - In construing the rights of an adopted child to take under a will, it is not a question of the right of the adopted child to inherit but simply a question of the testator's intent with respect to those who are to share in the estate. Thomas v. Trust Co. Bank, 247 Ga. 693, 279 S.E.2d 440 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a testator used the phrase "children of his body" evidencing an intent to include only natural children of her grandsons, and used the term "children, or descendants thereof" in describing the remaindermen in the testator's codicil, the testator's will was properly construed as excluding the adopted great-grandchildren. Epstein v. First Nat'l Bank, 260 Ga. 217, 391 S.E.2d 924 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-91).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Grandchildren take nothing in a will when children take bequests in their own stead.</b> - Motion for summary judgment of the testator's grandchildren in an action against their three uncles alleging that the grandchildren had an interest in the property that comprised the testator's estate was properly denied because the plain language of the will indicated that the testator did not intend that the bequests follow the law of intestacy, and the presumption in favor of a per stirpes distribution in the anti-lapse statute was overcome; the use of the phrase "per capita" in the will imposed a requirement that the individuals named, the testator's children, take the bequests in the children's own stead, and that the children had to survive the testator; and the grandchildren's mother, the testator's daughter, did not survive the testator.

Therefore, inasmuch as subprovision of will did not plainly manifest an intent of the testator contrary to the legal presumption that distribution should be per stirpes, the trial court did not err in attempting to construe the apparently inconsistent language of the subprovision in the context of the entire will.

<p class="p11"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Use of parol evidence.</b> - While parol evidence in some instances is authorized to explain an ambiguity in a will, oral testimony would be inadmissible for the purpose of inserting an entirely new clause in a will to dispose of an interest in property which the testator failed to devise. Lining v. Jackson, 203 Ga. 22, 45 S.E.2d 410 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>4. Reduction of Estates</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Estates devised absolutely in fee simple.</b> - Courts will not by construction reduce an estate once devised absolutely in fee, by limitations contained in subsequent parts of the will, unless the intention to limit the devise is clearly and unmistakably manifest. Barker v. Haunson, 174 Ga. 492, 163 S.E. 163 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3900). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, in a will, property is devised in language sufficient to pass a fee-simple estate, the will should not be held to convey a lesser estate unless it is clear from a subsequent provision of the will that such was the intention of the testator. Watts v. Finley, 187 Ga. 629, 1 S.E.2d 723 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When under the terms of the will, bequest in controversy was to vest unconditionally and in fee simple in a named brother of the testator upon his claiming such bequest within a stated period (otherwise to go to a designated legatee), and the brother claimed the bequest within the time limited, the title became vested unconditionally in the brother, and the bequest did not pass to the alternative legatee. Lassiter v. Bank of Dawson, 191 Ga. 208, 11 S.E.2d 910 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Language conditioning bequests to sons-in-law, "provided they are living with their present wives at the time of my death," has but one meaning and is unambiguous and legatee's contention that the son was prevented from meeting the condition by his wife's death, and that it was therefore ineffective, was without merit. Hungerford v. Trust Co., 190 Ga. 387, 9 S.E.2d 630 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a will is susceptible of such interpretation, a provision creating a remainder shall be construed "so as to vest the estate indefeasibly at the earliest possible period of time." Buchanan v. Nicholson, 192 Ga. 754, 16 S.E.2d 743 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When will devised all the property to the wife in fee simple, "to be used and disposed of in anywise as she may deem fit and proper for the exclusive benefit of herself and/or" their minor children and in the next paragraph disclosed that it was the testator's intention to leave the testator's estate in fee simple to the testator's spouse and their minor children with the testator's grown children receiving no share or claim upon the property, the property was devised to the wife absolutely and in fee simple. Aiken v. Aiken, 209 Ga. 819, 76 S.E.2d 481 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When testator intent unclear.</b> - In cases of real doubt as to the nature of the bequest, whether general or special, if the intention of the testator in respect thereto cannot be clearly ascertained from the will, the law will declare it general and not special. Henderson v. First Nat'l Bank, 189 Ga. 175, 5 S.E.2d 636 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In determining whether a particular bequest is general or special, resort must be had not alone to the particular item creating it, but to the will as a whole, in order to ascertain the intention of the testator which if it may be there discovered must control.

First Nat'l Bank, 246 Ga. 222, 271 S.E.2d 141 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the construction of unclear wills the courts look to that interpretation which carries out the provisions of the statute of distribution, and in the absence of anything in the will to the contrary the presumption is that the testator intended that his or her property should go where the law carries it, namely the channel of natural descent. Trust Co. Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 246 Ga. 222, 271 S.E.2d 141 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute of distribution seeks to effectuate the presumed intent of an intestate, and when a will is unclear the courts follow the statute of distribution to effectuate the intent of the testator.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Language requiring distribution per capita versus per stirpes.</b> - In the absence of anything in the will to the contrary, the presumption is that an ancestor intends that the ancestor's property should go where the law carries the property, which is supposed to be the channel of natural descent; and that the use of such terms as "in equal shares," or "share and share alike," or "equally divided," would not alone be sufficient to overcome this presumption and require a distribution per capita when the statute would require a distribution per stirpes. Harrison v. Odom, 241 Ga. 284, 244 S.E.2d 874 (1978) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-806).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2457, former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2457, former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3325, former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3901, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-94 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Surrounding circumstances.</b> - The most important of those surrounding circumstances mentioned in the statute are the recipients of one's bounty, their relations to that one and associations with that one, one's uniform affection for them, or any interruption of the current of that affection. Olmstead v. Dunn, 72 Ga. 850 (1884) (decided under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2457). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">General rule is that parol testimony is inadmissible to explain a will, except by proving the circumstances which surround the testator; the testator's relation to persons and things about the testator; and this may at all times be done. Billingslea v. Moore, 14 Ga. 370 (1853) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Declarations of testator admissible on issue of undue influence.</b> - Declarations of a testator freely and voluntarily made prior to the execution of the testator's will manifesting a long-continued purpose to dispose of the testator's property in a particular manner would be admissible on the issue as to whether undue influences had been exercised or not. Clements v. Clements, 247 Ga. 787, 279 S.E.2d 698 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inconsistent statements by testator.</b> - Parol evidence is not admissible to show that a testator meant one thing when the testator said another. Hall v. Beecher, 225 Ga. 354, 168 S.E.2d 581 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence prohibited if language of will unambiguous.</b> - Parol testimony was not admissible to raise a latent ambiguity in a devise, and thus to defeat the legal effect of the plain, unambiguous terms used. Gillespie v. Schuman, 62 Ga. 252 (1879) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2457). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the terms of a will are plain and unambiguous, parol testimony as to the sayings or statements of the testator that the testator intended to dispose of the testator's property in a certain way, and to certain persons, different from that expressed in the will, will be rejected. Hanvy v. Moore, 140 Ga. 691, 79 S.E. 772 (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3901). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it is true that the cardinal rule for the construction of wills requires that the intention of the testator should be ascertained and enforced, and that in so doing parol evidence may be resorted to when the language of the will is doubtful or uncertain, there is no room for construction when the meaning of the words used in the will is so plain and obvious that it cannot be misunderstood and this is true although the words may express a meaning entirely at variance with the real intention of the testator. Hall v. Beecher, 225 Ga. 354, 168 S.E.2d 581 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence necessary when words capable of multiple, reasonable interpretations.</b> - In a declaratory judgment action, the trial court erred in finding that language of a will unambiguous because the will used the alternative and seemingly interchangeable words "live," "reside," and "remain" to describe the conditions of the widow's life estate, and those words were capable of multiple, reasonable interpretations, parol evidence was therefore necessary to resolve the ambiguity and ascertain the decedent's intent in devising the life estate. DeMott v. DeMott, 353 Ga. App. 190, 836 S.E.2d 612 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Oral testimony for purpose of inserting entirely new meaning.</b> - While courts are authorized to hear parol testimony of the circumstances relating to the testator at the time of the execution of the will, yet when the language of the will is unambiguous and the testator's intention is stated in unmistakable language, parol evidence is inadmissible for the purpose of showing a different intention. Hungerford v. Trust Co., 190 Ga. 387, 9 S.E.2d 630 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the terms of a will when legally construed are plain and unambiguous, parol evidence cannot be received for the purpose of showing an intention contrary to that which the language when properly construed necessitated, nor is parol evidence admissible to raise a latent ambiguity and then to explain the ambiguity, thus when no such ambiguity exists as a legal construction will not resolve, the construction is for the court, and not for the jury. Snellings v. Downer, 193 Ga. 340, 18 S.E.2d 531 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807); Hall v. Beecher, 225 Ga. 354, 168 S.E.2d 581 (1969);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While parol evidence in some instances is authorized to explain an ambiguity in a will, oral testimony would be inadmissible for the purpose of inserting an entirely new clause in a will to dispose of an interest in property which the testator failed to devise. Lining v. Jackson, 203 Ga. 22, 45 S.E.2d 410 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the language of the will is unambiguous and the testator's intent is stated in clear and precise language, parol evidence is not admissible for the purpose of showing a different intent. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Kelly, 223 Ga. 294, 154 S.E.2d 584 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the terms of a will are plain and unambiguous, the terms must control, and parol evidence cannot be received to give the will a meaning different from that which is clearly and unequivocally expressed therein. Hall v. Beecher, 225 Ga. 354, 168 S.E.2d 581 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of parol evidence generally.</b> - If from the will the intention is manifest, there is neither a necessity for, nor a power to admit parol testimony. Ambiguity is the basis upon which it is admitted if at all; if there is no ambiguity, if the intention is manifest, the precedent condition of admissibility is wanting; and it is not an ambiguity which is undefined, a loose supposition that there may be doubt, a conjectural hypothesis of a variant intent. Leroy M. Wiley, Parish &amp; Co. v. Smith, 3 Ga. 551 (1847), overruled on other grounds, Folsom v. First Nat'l Bank of Atlanta, 246 Ga. 320, 271 S.E.2d 461 (1980) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the intention cannot be clearly ascertained, by reason of any patent ambiguity as to the thing bequeathed, or the person who shall take, the court will hear evidence to explain such ambiguity as to the thing or person. Williams v. McIntyre, 8 Ga. 34 (1850) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Parol evidence could not change, add to, or contradict a written will, but where there were ambiguities, whether latent or patent, the ambiguities could be explained by the parol evidence. Burge v. Hamilton, 72 Ga. 568 (1884) (decided under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2457) Doyal v. Smith, 28 Ga. 262 (1859) See also (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While parol evidence is admissible to raise a latent ambiguity in a description and then explain it, in every case the intention of the maker of the instrument must be gathered from the instrument itself, read in the light of the parol evidence. Of course it is not permissible to create a devise or bequest by parol; but the parol evidence must show what the testator's real intention was from the language used. Olive v. Henderson, 121 Ga. 836, 49 S.E. 743, 104 Am. St. R. 185 (1905) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3325).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between latent and patent ambiguities.</b> - If a double meaning is apparent on the face of the instrument, then the ambiguity is a patent one. If the language is apparently not of double meaning, but is shown to be so only by the aid of collateral or extrinsic facts, the ambiguity is latent. Olive v. Henderson, 121 Ga. 836, 49 S.E. 743, 104 Am. St. R. 185 (1905) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3325).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When the language of a will is doubtful or ambiguous,</b> parol evidence is admissible for the purpose of assisting the court in ascertaining its meaning. In such a case parol evidence may be admitted for the purpose of showing and explaining a latent ambiguity in a will. But, when the terms of a will are plain and unambiguous, they cannot be varied or explained by parol evidence showing an intention on the part of the testator at variance with that expressed in the instrument. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Clark, 172 Ga. 625, 158 S.E. 297 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence to establish identity.</b> - Writing purporting to convey land "to the heirs of" a named person, when that person is dead and the heirs are ascertainable, is not void upon the ground that "it does not show and does not describe the grantees"; for if there are persons ascertainable who are the heirs of the person named parol evidence would be admissible to establish their identity. Farrar Lumber Co. v. Brindle, 170 Ga. 37, 151 S.E. 923 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Motive in making a bequest is a legitimate field for judicial inquiry</b> only to the extent that motive may illuminate the vital question of intent, when, due to the uncertain and ambiguous language of the will, the testator's intent is doubtful. Hungerford v. Trust Co., 190 Ga. 387, 9 S.E.2d 630 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of term "appropriate."</b> - Parol evidence was admissible to determine testator's intent as the term "appropriate" in the will provision restricting the attorney's choice of government agency, charity, or foundation to which the testator's real property would go was ambiguous. Board of Regents v. Bates, 262 Ga. 307, 418 S.E.2d 8 (1992) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-94).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It is not competent to prove the contents of a will by parol evidence.</b> Thomasson v. Driskell, 13 Ga. 253 (1853) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence admitted.</b> - Because the will contained a latent ambiguity as to which of two nephews was the intended beneficiary, evidence as to all the facts and circumstances respecting the decedent and the decedent's nephews, as well as parol evidence of the decedent's declarations, was admissible. Legare v. Legare, 268 Ga. 474, 490 S.E.2d 369 (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-94).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge on inadmissibility of parol evidence</b> applies to will construction cases, not will validity cases. Clements v. Clements, 247 Ga. 787, 279 S.E.2d 698 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-807).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(1) If the testator had no other child living at the time the will was executed, an omitted child receives a share equal in value to that which the child would have received had the testator died intestate but only to the extent that any provision in the will to or for the benefit of the surviving parent of the omitted child is not thereby reduced; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

To the extent feasible, the interest granted an omitted child must be of the same character, whether legal or equitable, present or future, as that left to the testator's other children under the will.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application only to mistake arising from mere ignorance.</b> - There is a difference between a "mistake" arising from mere ignorance and one which results from an error of judgment after investigation or from negligent or willful failure to make a proper investigation by means of which the truth could be readily and surely ascertained. It is to such a mistake as that first indicated that the statute applied; it could not have been intended to operate in instances of the latter character. Thornton v. Hulme, 218 Ga. 480, 128 S.E.2d 744 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-210); Herrin v. Herrin, 224 Ga. 579, 163 S.E.2d 713 (1968); Yancey v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Will can be set aside for mistake of fact arising from ignorance,</b> but not from an error in judgment after an investigation or after willful failure to investigate. Hammett v. Reynolds, 243 Ga. 669, 256 S.E.2d 354 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-210).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error in judgment does not constitute mistake of fact.</b> - Mere fact that a testator bequeathed to the testator's daughter a note in the testator's possession, executed by her to the testator, which had been paid, did not show such a mistake of fact as to the conduct of an heir at law as is contemplated by law, so as to justify a finding that the testator should be deemed to have died intestate as to such heir at law. Watkins v. Jones, 184 Ga. 831, 193 S.E. 889 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-210). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When caveator insists that the trial court erred in directing a verdict for propounder because the evidence shows that the will was executed under a mistake of fact as to the conduct of caveator, the heir at law of testator, viz: that caveator was continuing to assert a right to one-half of the property whereas caveator was not continuing to assert such a right, caveator's evidence shows no more than an erroneous deduction or conclusion by testator that because caveator once asserted a right to one-half of the property, caveator was continuing to do so. This is not ignorance of the basic facts. It is at most an error of judgment resulting from a failure to make an investigation of the matter, which does not constitute a mistake of fact. Thornton v. Hulme, 218 Ga. 480, 128 S.E.2d 744 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-210). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Caveat to a will filed by the testator's wife on the ground that the testator mistakenly believed the wife had signed an enforceable antenuptial agreement did not allege a mistake of fact, but a mistake of judgment; the testator knew as a fact that she signed the agreement; whether the testator believed it was enforceable was a matter of judgment. Kaplan v. Kaplan, 266 Ga. 612, 469 S.E.2d 198 (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-8). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purported mistake of the testator relating to her belief that she owned certain property which was claimed to be owned by son was not a mistake of fact as to the existence or conduct of an heir. Shore v. Malloy, 267 Ga. 44, 472 S.E.2d 303 (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-8).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistake of fact as to conduct of heir as to such heir.</b> - When court submitted to the jury the issue of whether the will was executed by the testator under a mistake of fact as to the conduct of the caveatrices, and properly instructed the jury that if the jury found the will to have been so executed it would be inoperative as to such heir or heirs, it was error to instruct the jury that, if the jury found the will to have been so executed, the jury should return a verdict finding against the will as a whole. Moreland v. Word, 209 Ga. 463, 74 S.E.2d 82 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-210).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Law does not require that a father provide for the support of his children after his death;</b> public policy, of course, favors the support of minor children by the father's estate after death.

<p class="p4"><b>Prejudiced attitude toward own children insufficient to raise issue of incompetence.</b> - Law does not say, because a man is narrowminded, prejudiced, unforgiving, or even mean in his relations to some of his children, that he is incompetent to make a will, and the testimony of witnesses that he is incapable or incompetent because of such an attitude toward a child cannot make an issue for the jury to pass upon. Watkins v. Jones, 184 Ga. 831, 193 S.E. 889 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-210).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Legacy is testamentary gift of personalty.</b> - Will provision which provides that the plaintiff in a case against the executors of the estate, "shall be paid a salary" so long as the plaintiff shall serve as manager of a named business does not purport to make a gift to the plaintiff, and plaintiff's contention that he has a "legacy" under this provision of the will is without merit. A legacy is a gift of personalty by will. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

<p class="p4"><b>Demonstrative legacy distinguished.</b> - Demonstrative legacy is one which designates the fund or property from which it is to be satisfied, but is nevertheless an unconditional gift to the legatee of the amount or value specified. That it names a particular fund or other property from which it is to be satisfied is considered to be demonstrative of a convenient mode of payment; if that mode fails, the legacy is to be satisfied out of the general assets of the estate. A demonstrative legacy differs from a general legacy in that it does not, in the first instance, abate upon insufficiency of assets to pay the debts of the estate and the expenses of distribution; it differs from a specific legacy in that there is recourse for its payment from the general assets of the estate in the event of ademption in part or in whole.

<p class="p4"><b>General not specific legacy.</b> - When the legacy "is to be raised from his estate," no particular property being designated to pay it, it is general and not specific. Morton v. Murrell, 68 Ga. 141 (1881) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2458).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts favor general legacies.</b> - When a general money legacy is given, the testator is not to be presumed to have intended to make it dependent upon the existence of a fund merely because the testator has indicated that it is to be paid out of that fund. On the contrary, if the will gives a money legacy, and a particular fund is charged with the payment of it, the presumption is that this only indicates an intention to furnish an additional security for its payment; since, if the fund charged is sufficient, the legacy shall not abate, though the condition of the estate is such that other general legacies are compelled to abate. Tennille v. Phelps, 49 Ga. 532 (1873) (decided under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2422). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>General legacy defined.</b> - General legacy is one which does not direct delivery of any particular property; it is not limited to any particular asset and may be satisfied out of any property of the same general character belonging to the estate of the testator.

<p class="p4"><b>General legacy is a gift of something to be furnished out of the testator's general personal estate;</b> it need not form part of the testator's property at the time of the testator's death.

<p class="p4"><b>Bequest of notes.</b> - Bequest in the following words, "also notes to the amount of sixteen hundred dollars on K. and C. security, for the purpose of purchasing a plantation for the use of S. etc.," is not a specific legacy, and is not adeemed by the sale and transfer of the notes by the testator in the testator's lifetime. Smith v. Executors of Smith, 23 Ga. 21 (1857) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Gift of money is general legacy.</b> - Legacy of the "particular fund" which testator was to receive for the testator's "home place" was not a gift of money to be paid from a specified sum, but it was a gift of a "particular fund," not of part of it, or of a sum to be taken from it, or out of it, but a gift of the whole of "said sum," a particular fund, raised by the sale of a specific legacy. Whitlock v. Vaun, 38 Ga. 562 (1868) (decided under former Code 1863, <span class="s1">§</span> 2426). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Money legacy left to the executor of a will, though expressed to be "in addition to the usual commissions obtained by law, and as a full compensation for any extra trouble he may have in executing the will," is a general legacy, and cannot, as a legacy, be exempted from abatement with other general legacies, in case of a deficiency of assets. Greene v. Foster, 178 Ga. 319, 173 S.E. 91 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As a general rule, it is true that a gift of money, to be paid from a specified fund is, nevertheless, a general legacy, and a failure of the fund does not destroy the legacy, but it is unquestionably true that a testator may so charge a money legacy upon a particular fund as to make the legacy follow the fate of the fund. Tinsley v. Maddox, 176 Ga. 471, 168 S.E. 297 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Residuary legacy defined.</b> - Residuary legacy "is a general legacy into which falls all the assets of the estate after the satisfaction of all other legacies and the payment of all debts of the estate and all costs of administration." Young v. Young, 202 Ga. 694, 44 S.E.2d 659 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808); Woodall v.

<p class="p4">Code does not provide for any subclassification of general legacies and any attempt to so do would be arbitrary and without authority either by statute or otherwise. Killingsworth v.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific legacy defined.</b> - Specific legacy is one which operates on property particularly designated; a gift of money to be paid from a specified fund is nevertheless a general legacy. Tinsley v. Maddox, 176 Ga. 471, 168 S.E. 297 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Special legacy is one which operates on property specifically designated while a specific legatee, is one to whom is bequeathed a particular thing, as distinguished from all others of the same kind. Regents of Univ. Sys. v. Trust Co., 186 Ga. 498, 198 S.E. 345 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a will purported to bequeath to the trustees of the University of Georgia the "entire corpus" including accumulated interest, less monthly allowances from the income to four named persons during their lives respectively, and except $100.00 each to two of her husband's nephews, this was a specific legacy to the trustees of the University of Georgia. Regents of Univ. Sys. v. Trust Co., 186 Ga. 498, 198 S.E. 345 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Specific bequest or devise has given as its particular characteristic that it gives or devises to the named legatee a particular article or item of property owned by the testator or in some instances to be acquired by him, which is identified and distinguished from all others of the same nature and which, as stated, may be segregated from the mass of the testator's other property or estate. Henderson v. First Nat'l Bank, 189 Ga. 175, 5 S.E.2d 636 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Special legacy is one that can be separated from the body of the estate and pointed out so as to individualize it, and enable it to be delivered to the legatee as a thing sui juris. The testator fixes upon it, as it were, a label, by which it may be identified and marked for delivery to the owner, and the title to it, as a separable thing, vests at once, on the death of the testator, in the legatee. Young v. Young, 202 Ga. 694, 44 S.E.2d 659 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808); Woodall v.

<p class="p4">Failure by the testator to particularize the $1,000.00 bonds bequeathed to stated children, forbid their being classified as specific legacies, and, consequently they do not fail but are payable as general legacies, $1,000.00 to each legatee, out of the general assets of the estate, including the proceeds from the sale of the three bonds on hand after the payment of debts, if any, and the expenses of administration. Young v. Young, 202 Ga. 694, 44 S.E.2d 659 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fact that the will provides for the legal title to particular property to be held by a trustee for the benefit of the widow does not prevent the legacy from being a specific one. It is the particular designation of the property itself, not who holds the property's legal title, which makes the legacy specific. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808); Killingsworth v.

<p class="p4">Specific legacy means a devise which distinguishes the devised property from all other property of the same nature and thereby enables it to be separated from the body of the estate and delivered to the devisee as a thing sui juris. Peacock v. Owens, 244 Ga. 203, 259 S.E.2d 458 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Specific legacy subject to ademption.</b> - Legacy is not a specific legacy, which will be adeemed when it does not bequeath a bond so labeled and sequestered as to be distinguished from another bond of a similar kind it is a demonstrative legacy and does not fail if the subject matter be not in existence on the death of the testator. Young v. Young, 202 Ga. 694, 44 S.E.2d 659 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the particular property described in the specific legacy is disposed of by the testator during the testator's life or cannot be located at the testator's death, it is adeemed and the legatee has no claim on the estate for the value of the legacy. DuBose v. Box, 246 Ga. 660, 273 S.E.2d 101 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-808).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of cy pres.</b> - When a valid charitable bequest is incapable for some reason of execution in the exact manner provided by the testator, a court of equity will carry it into effect in such a way as will as nearly as possible effectuate the intention of the testator. This doctrine has no application whatever to a case where a charitable bequest fails entirely for the reason that is in opposition to a well-settled rule of law. Kelley v. Welborn, 110 Ga. 540, 35 S.E. 636 (1900), overruled on other grounds, Hood v. First Nat'l Bank, 219 Ga. 283, 133 S.E.2d 19 (1963) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of cy pres doctrine.</b> - Fundamental purpose of cy pres provisions is to allow the court to carry out the general charitable intent of the testator where this intent might otherwise be thwarted by the impossibility of the particular plan or scheme provided by the testator. Evans v. Abney, 396 U.S. 435, 90 S. Ct. 628, 24 L. Ed. 2d 634 (1970) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Rules governing the establishment and administration of charitable trusts</b> are different from those applicable to private trusts in giving effect to the intention of the donor and in establishing the charity. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815); Moss v.

<p class="p4">Gifts and bequests for religious purposes are more highly favored by laws than other species of trusts.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application generally.</b> - As a general rule, the doctrine of cy pres is applied in cases: (1) when there is the presence of an otherwise valid charitable grant or trust; that is, one that has charity as its purpose and sufficiently offers benefits to an indefinite public; (2) when the specific intention of the settlor may not be legally or practically carried into effect; and (3) when there is exhibited a general charitable intent on the part of the settlor. Trammell v. Elliott, 230 Ga. 841, 199 S.E.2d 194 (1973), for comment, see 10 Ga. St. B.J. 502 (1974) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It never has been considered as an objection to a charitable use,</b> that it was general, and in some respects indefinite, unless there was an uncertainty as to the amount intended to be given, or the general object of the use was of so uncertain and indefinite a character, that it could not be executed. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Objects to be benefited to some extent indefinite.</b> - Fact that those managing the hospital might not be able to receive and treat all of the applicants who constitute the class of beneficiaries of the benevolent scheme contained in the wills making the hospital the sole beneficiary would not be a reason for holding that the entire charitable scheme had failed, or for the application of the doctrine of cy pres. Reynolds v. Stanton, 174 Ga. 340, 162 S.E. 783 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3914). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is of the very essence of a charitable bequest that the objects to be benefited shall be to some extent indefinite. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When it was apparent from the entire will and codicil that a bequest to the governing authorities of a named association, "same being an Orphan's Home located at Macon, Georgia," was intended as a charitable trust for the benefit of orphans as a class, and that the designated "governing authorities" were merely to perform the office of trustee, the bequest was sufficiently definite and specific to be capable of execution, and since a trust will not fail for the want of a trustee, the legacy would not lapse merely because there may have been no such orphan's home and "governing authorities" as were mentioned in the will; in such case a court of equity could, by approximation, effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator in a manner most similar to that indicated by the testator. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the finding was authorized that hospital owned and maintained by the City of Augusta, commonly known as the "University Hospital of Augusta, Georgia," and thus designated in the will in question, was a charitable institution, owned by that city and maintained primarily for the gratuitous treatment of the sick and needy of the city and county, and that by that item the testator intended the estate therein bequeathed to be applied to the promotion of the charitable objects of such hospital, the charitable bequest, being valid, would be given effect. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the manifest intention was to create a charitable trust for tubercular children, even though the charitable institution named never existed, the purpose and object for which the trust was created still exists and the legacy does not lapse, and the cy pres doctrine applies. Creech v. Scottish Rite Hosp. for Crippled Children, 211 Ga. 195, 84 S.E.2d 563 (1954), for comment, see 17 Ga. B.J. 512 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legatee not designated by correct name.</b> - Charitable bequest will not fail merely because the legatee is not designated by its correct name, if from the will itself and admissible extrinsic evidence it can be determined whom the testator intended to receive and apply such bequest. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cy pres will not be applied when</b> there is demonstrated an intention of the settlor contrary to the inference of general charitable intent that the property should be applied exclusively to the purpose which is or has become impracticable or illegal. Such demonstration of a specific intent of the settlor as would result in a failure of the devise must be clear, definite, and unambiguous. In such event the trust will fail, and a resulting trust will be implied for the benefit of the testator or the testator's heirs. Trammell v. Elliott, 230 Ga. 841, 199 S.E.2d 194 (1973), for comment, see 10 Ga. St. B.J. 502 (1974) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cy Pres doctrine is inapplicable.</b> - When the accomplishment of the particular purpose and only that purpose was desired by the testator and the testator had no more general charitable intent and the testator would presumably have preferred to have the whole trust fail if the particular purpose is impossible of accomplishment, the cy pres doctrine is not applicable. Evans v. Abney, 396 U.S. 435, 90 S. Ct. 628, 24 L. Ed. 2d 634 (1970), for comment, see 22 Mercer L.

Newson v. Starke, 46 Ga. 88 (1872) (decided under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2432) Beall v. Ex'rs of Fox, 4 Ga. 404 (1848) See also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of equity has an inherent jurisdiction</b> in cases of charitable bequests and devises, and cases of charity in the courts of equity in England were held valid, and executed independently of, and previous to the statute of 43d Elizabeth. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the framers of the Code declared the courts of chancery (now equity) to have jurisdiction to enforce charitable bequests, declared what were charities and recognized the doctrine of cy pres, the framers intended to say something more than that courts of equity could enforce trusts; there was no propriety in giving this special jurisdiction or in defining charitable purposes if a bequest, for charitable purposes, to be valid, must have the same certainty and definiteness as to its objects and mode of division, as bequests, not for charitable purposes. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Special equity jurisdiction over charitable bequests grows out of the rule that, in cases of private right, courts will not enforce uncertainties, and that the parties at interest must be capable of definite ascertainment, but it is of the very nature of a charity that this is impossible, and from the most ancient times courts of chancery (now equity) in England have applied very different rules in determining the validity of charitable bequests from the rules applied to such as were not charitable. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3912, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-101 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative purpose.</b> - Purpose of the General Assembly in passing this statute was to treat the costs of the administration of the estate as much a debt of the decedent as any other obligation to which the decedent may be subject. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 118 Ga. App. 440, 164 S.E.2d 361 (1968) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Property subject to payment of debts of decedents.</b> - While it is true that the commissions of the personal representative of a decedent do not, strictly speaking or primarily, constitute a debt due by the decedent, still the commissions due the personal representative of a decedent must be construed as part of the costs, and fall under the head of necessary expenses of administration. It is only another way of saying that of the property of the decedent, whether personalty or realty, is subject to the payment of the decedent's obligations. Colyer v. Huntley, 179 Ga. 332, 175 S.E. 901 (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Immunity of real estate from sale to pay the commissions of an executor</b> has been abrogated, and commissions of an executor or administrator are expenses of administration to which any property of a decedent is subject. Colyer v. Huntley, 179 Ga. 332, 175 S.E. 901 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute refers to "debts" owing by the deceased in his or her lifetime;</b> it does not apply to such a demand where, long after the death of the testator, a bank fails and by operation of law there is a liability against the stock formerly owned by such testator and except as provided by law, there is no person authorized to contract a debt against an estate of a deceased person. State Banking Co. v. Hinton, 178 Ga. 68, 172 S.E. 42 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Words "debt" or "debts" of an estate, used in a refunding bond given to an executor "are obviously the debts of the decedent, due by him in his life time, and not the claims of the executor for remuneration and expenses of the estate." State Banking Co. v. Hinton, 178 Ga. 68, 172 S.E. 42 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debt in its general sense is a specific sum of money which is due or owing</b> from one person to another, and denotes not only the obligation of one person to pay, but the right of the other party to receive and enforce payment by judicial action. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 118 Ga. App. 440, 164 S.E.2d 361 (1968) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Taxes due a county or municipality</b> come within the generally accepted meaning of personal debts, the collection of which is enforceable by appropriate judicial action. Woodall v.

<p class="p4"><b>Will provision directing that "all just debts be paid without unnecessary delay,"</b> without more, is not an instruction to pay debts out of the gross estate rather than out of the residuum.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Priority</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Priority generally.</b> - As between the devisee of property on which there is a mortgage lien, and a devisee of other property, both being specific devises, the mortgage debt should be borne by the devisees of the mortgaged property. Raines v. Shipley, 197 Ga. 448, 29 S.E.2d 588 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In regard to priority, debts and legacies stand on precisely the same footing and one can no more be diminished by the payment of commissions than the other. The expenses of administration, among which are the commissions of the representative, must first be paid whether enough be left to satisfy debts and legacies, or not. Alston v. United States, 228 F. Supp. 216 (N.D. Ga. 1964), aff'd, 349 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1965) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Abatement of legacy given in lieu of year's support.</b> - Legacy accepted by a widow under a will in lieu of other marital rights will not abate with other legacies to pay debts. Daniel v. Denham, 223 Ga. 544, 156 S.E.2d 906 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Testamentary legacy to a wife, specifically given in lieu of year's support, is entitled to preference over other legacies and devises although the legacy exceeds the value of the year's support. When the remaining estate is adequate to pay all the obligations of the estate, such legacy of the wife will not abate to pay the debts and obligations of the testator. Killingsworth v. First Nat'l Bank, 237 Ga. 544, 228 S.E.2d 901 (1976) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-821). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1863, <span class="s1">§</span> 2430, former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2462, former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 1330, former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3906, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-103 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No restriction on testator.</b> - Former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3906 and 3907, dealing with lapsed legacies and the results of lapses, apply in cases involving an absolute legacy, without more, and a lapse; but the statutes in no way restrict the power of a testator to provide what shall become of the testator's estate in case of the death of a legatee named in it. Foster v. Hardee, 135 Ga. 591, 69 S.E. 1110 (1911) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It is familiar law that a legacy lapses by the death of the legatee or devisee</b> in the life time of the testator, unless there be words of substitution or other provisions in the will, or by statute against a lapse. Collier v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 206 Ga. 857, 59 S.E.2d 385 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>At common law and under the law of this state before the Act of 1836</b> (former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812), if the legatee died before the death of the testator the legacy lapsed, whether the legatee left issue or not. Now, if there be issue, the issue takes as substituting legatee. Sanders v. First Nat'l Bank, 189 Ga. 450, 6 S.E.2d 294 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of designating beneficiaries by name in will.</b> - Testator's designation of beneficiaries by name generally indicates the testator intended the beneficiaries to take as individuals, but other language in the will may show a controlling intention that the individuals take as a class. Whitlock v. Lawson, 260 Ga. 520, 397 S.E.2d 433 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Death of legatee without descendants creates lapse of legacy.</b> - Normally when a sole legatee under a will predeceases the testator and leaves no lineal descendants, a lapse of the legacy occurs, and the testator's estate passes to his or her heirs at law. However, a testator may prevent such a lapse by providing for the disposition of his or her estate in the event of the death of the legatee. Fiumefreddo v. Scudder, 252 Ga. 279, 313 S.E.2d 683 (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section prevents lapse of legacies.</b> - Statute provides what shall be done when a legatee who has already been determined predeceases the testator, and is intended to prevent the lapse of legacies. Johns v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 206 Ga. 313, 57 S.E.2d 182 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ultimate effect of the statute is that the devise vests in the issue in the same proportions as if inherited directly from their deceased ancestor. Seymour v. Presley, 239 Ga. 572, 238 S.E.2d 347 (1977) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Those who are entitled to the devise will take as substituted beneficiaries,</b> and not as heirs of the deceased legatee. Seymour v.

<p class="p4"><b>When the legacies and devices are not absolute and are limited.</b> - When the legatee dies before a contingent legacy is vested, there is nothing to transmit to the heirs. Allen v. Whitaker, 34 Ga. 6 (1864) (decided under former Code 1863, <span class="s1">§</span> 2430). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Testator devised to J. $2,500.00, "provided he is in my employment at the time of my death." J. voluntarily severed business relations with the testator, and died before the death of the testator. In a suit by the testator's wife and children to recover the legacy, it was held that the legacy lapsed, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover. Johnson v. Folsom, 145 Ga. 479, 89 S.E. 521 (1916) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3906). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute does not apply when the legacy is made expressly contingent on the legatee surviving the testator and then the legatee predeceases the testator. Powell v. Watkins, 221 Ga. 851, 148 S.E.2d 303 (1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If they had been absolute and not limited, lapse would have been prevented by this statute, even though the beneficiaries are a class, where all the class predeceased the testator, as contrasted with the situation where one of a class survives, preventing lapse and the intervention of this statute; when one of a class survives, the rule of survivorship is applicable. Graham v. Patton, 231 Ga. 391, 202 S.E.2d 58 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Issue of deceased need not also be descendant of testator.</b> - Statute does not require that the issue of a deceased legatee or devisee also be a descendant of the testator before a legacy or devise will vest under the statute. Robinson v. Ray, 254 Ga. 237, 327 S.E.2d 721 (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Statute does not apply to class gifts.</b> Johnson v. Wishard, 227 Ga. 355, 180 S.E.2d 738 (1971) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application to class gifts.</b> - When there is a devise to a class, those dying in the lifetime of the testator do not take, and there being no question of lapsed legacy, the statute is inapplicable. Davie v. Wynn, 80 Ga. 673, 6 S.E. 183 (1888) (decided under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2462); Tolbert v.

<p class="p4">Statute has no application to the case where the legacy is to a class, and one or more of the class is in esse at the testator's death. It is only when all the members of the class predecease the testator that a lapse will be prevented. Davis v. Sanders, 123 Ga. 177, 51 S.E. 298 (1905) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3330). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A bequest to B and B's children is a bequest to a class. The class consists of B and such of B's children as survive the testator. B had a child who died before the testator, leaving issue, such issue would not share with B in the legacy under the law. Davis v. Sanders, 123 Ga. 177, 51 S.E. 298 (1905) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3330). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Devise by a mother to her children, share and share alike, including her son, is a devise to a class, and the whole property thereunder goes to those members of the class only who survive the testator. Hurst v. McKissack, 209 Ga. 440, 73 S.E.2d 91 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Gifts held to be to individuals, rather than to class.</b> - When a testator named a testator's daughter and granddaughter in the testator's will, and stated the testator's intention to reward them individually for services they had rendered to the testator, the probate court erred by ruling that the testator intended a class, rather than individual, gift. Whitlock v. Lawson, 260 Ga. 520, 397 S.E.2d 433 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute cannot be applied when an unfulfilled condition attached to vesting.</b> Graham v. Patton, 231 Ga. 391, 202 S.E.2d 58 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Devise to children.</b> - When a testator by the testator's will gave to one of the testator's daughters one-fourth of the testator's estate, and the daughter died before the death of the testator, leaving two children who survived her and the testator, the interest in the estate of the testator so given to this daughter, the same being absolute and without remainder or limitation, vested in such issue of the daughter as if inherited directly from their deceased grandfather. When a daughter of such deceased daughter of the testator died intestate, leaving no spouse or issue, but leaving her father and a sister as her sole heirs at law, such father and sister become entitled to any estate to which the deceased daughter was entitled either in right of her mother under the will of her grandfather or in her own right. Terry v. Chandler, 172 Ga. 715, 158 S.E. 572 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3906). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the grantee in the deed was also appointed by will, but died before the will became effective, leaving a child as the sole heir at law, who was in life at the death of the testator, the child was substituted as appointee by operation of law, and took the property in remainder, to the exclusion of the person to whom the named appointee had attempted to convey the property. Newton v. Bullard, 181 Ga. 448, 182 S.E. 614 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Unless there be something to indicate a contrary intent on the part of the testator, a devise or bequest to a named person, followed by a provision that if the person shall die childless the property shall pass to some other person, conveys to the person a fee, subject to be divested upon the person dying childless, or, as it is sometimes called, a base or qualified fee. Scranton-Lackawanna Trust Co. v. Bruen, 206 Ga. 872, 59 S.E.2d 397 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Devise of the residue of testator's estate to one person, and if the testator should die without children to another,</b> conveys to the first devisee an estate in fee defeasible on the testator dying childless, and when, as here, the second devisee survived the testator, but predeceased the first devisee, upon the death of the first without child or children, the property passed to the heirs of the second devisee. Scranton-Lackawanna Trust Co. v. Bruen, 206 Ga. 872, 59 S.E.2d 397 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absence of residuary clause.</b> - When the original will did not contain a residuary clause, and two daughters had died a short time prior to the execution of the codicil which provided that property given to one deceased daughter would descend to testator's other heirs, it was the manifest intention of the testator to, in effect, supply a residuary clause to the will. Davant v. Shaw, 206 Ga. 843, 59 S.E.2d 500 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legacy to a testator's daughter having lapsed by her death</b> before the death of the testator, the interest in the estate given to this daughter, the same being absolute and without remainder or limitation, and this daughter having left issue living at the death of the testator, vested in such issue as if inherited directly from the deceased grandfather. Powell v. Watkins, 221 Ga. 851, 148 S.E.2d 303 (1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-812).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute inapplicable.</b> - Anti lapse statute under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-64(a) did not apply when the intent of the testator in drafting the will with regards to the testator's residual estate clearly expressed the intent that the bequests were contingent upon the beneficiaries surviving the testator; the bequests were conditional and lapsed when the unfulfilled condition attached to vesting. Bridges v. Taylor, 276 Ga. 530, 579 S.E.2d 740 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Motion for summary judgment of the testator's grandchildren in an action against their three uncles alleging that the grandchildren had an interest in the property that comprised the testator's estate was properly denied because the plain language of the will indicated that the testator did not intend that the bequests follow the law of intestacy, and the presumption in favor of a per stirpes distribution in the anti-lapse statute was overcome; the use of the phrase "per capita" in the will imposed a requirement that the individuals named, the testator's children, take the bequests in the children's own stead, and that the children had to survive the testator; and the grandchildren's mother, the testator's daughter, did not survive the testator.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ademption Rule</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of ademption.</b> - Ademption of a specific legacy is the extinction or withdrawal of it, in consequence of some act of the testator equivalent to its revocation, or clearly indicative of an intention to revoke. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 753, 34 S. Ct. 322, 58 L. Ed. 467 (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ademption is effected by the extinction of the thing or fund bequeathed, or by disposition of it subsequent to the will from which an intention that the legacy should fail is presumed. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 753, 34 S. Ct. 322, 58 L. Ed. 467 (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Term "ademption" is sometimes used as synonymous with satisfaction, but such use is inaccurate, as ademption operates independently of intention in case the specific thing given is, at the testator's death, no longer owned by the testator. Kramer v. Kramer, 201 F. 248 (5th Cir. 1912), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 753, 34 S. Ct. 322, 58 L. Ed. 467 (1913) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ademption generally.</b> - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterward become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Thompson v. Long, 202 Ga. 718, 44 S.E.2d 651 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Standard for defining a "conveyance"</b> is whether there has occurred a change in the testator's ownership sufficiently radical to manifest, as a matter of law, the testator's intention to revoke the specific devise. The term "conveyance" includes a single transaction by which a testator sells the testator's fee simple title to real estate in return for a security title to the real estate sold. Peacock v. Owens, 244 Ga. 203, 259 S.E.2d 458 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ademption arises upon the conveyance of the specific property covered by the legacy,</b> and rests upon a rule of law independent of any supposed actual intent of the testator; and in the absence of any facts which would bring the case within the exceptions set forth in statute, and in the absence of any provision in the will in contemplation of such a contingency, a trial court properly held that a devise had been wholly adeemed by reason of the conveyance of the realty involved, and since the testator died intestate as to this devise, that the proceeds thereof passed into the residuum of the estate. Thompson v. Long, 202 Ga. 718, 44 S.E.2d 651 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Devise adeemed.</b> - When a testator conveys to another specific property devised or bequeathed, and does not afterwards become possessed of the property, and the will contains no provision for such contingency, the devise or legacy is adeemed, and such legal result cannot be obviated by extrinsic evidence tending to show that the testator did not intend it. Moncrief v. Shuman, 169 Ga. 217, 150 S.E. 98 (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a testator conveys to a third party specific property devised and the will contains no provision for such a contingency, there can be no inquiry into a testator's intention in adeeming specifically bequeathed property. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although a testator failed to form a limited partnership prior to the testator's death, such that a devise of member certificates was without effect and was adeemed, the business property that was devised to beneficiaries was not limited to that entity. Simmons v. England, 323 Ga. App. 251, 746 S.E.2d 862 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Devise held to be adeemed.</b> - When wife devised one-half interest in real estate to husband by specific devise, but did not devise the proceeds of its sale to husband, the specific devise was adeemed by alienation when testator sold the fee simple title in return for a down payment, note, and security title. Powell v. Thorsen, 253 Ga. 572, 322 S.E.2d 261 (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-2-105).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ademption and substitution.</b> - Because the purchase of a second property closed over a year before the sale of the bequeathed property closed and the testator executed a valid codicil after the sale that did not mention either property, the bequeathed property was adeemed pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-66; consequently, there was no basis for substitution under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-67(a). Fletcher v. Ellenburg, 279 Ga. 52, 609 S.E.2d 337 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exceptions</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exceptions to ademption rule.</b> - There are four exceptions to the rule that ademption occurs when a testator conveys to another the specific property bequeathed, those exceptions are: (1) where the testator afterwards becomes possessed of the same property; (2) where the attempt to convey fails; (3) where the testator exchanges the property for other of like character; and (4) where the testator merely changes the investment of a fund bequeathed. Lang v. Vaughn, 137 Ga. 671, 74 S.E. 270, 40 L.R.A. (n.s.) 542, 1913B Ann. Cas. 52 (1912) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817) Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A specific devise is adeemed when, after the execution of the will, the testator "conveys" to another the specific property devised unless one of the following four exceptions applies: reacquisition by the testator; failure of the conveyance; receipt of like property in exchange for the devised property, and mere change in the investment of a fund. Peacock v. Owens, 244 Ga. 203, 259 S.E.2d 458 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Statement that "the law deems the intention to be,"</b> etc., in the statute, shows that if the testator makes no provision in the testator's will on the subject, expressive of the testator's intent in case of a sale or the like, the law declares what it deems is the testator's legal intent; or, in other words, provides what shall be the result in such case. This excludes the idea that in every case what the law deems to be the intent has no force, and that the courts will go afield hunting for an intent expressed in parol or to be gathered from conduct or acts of the testator after the making of the will. Lang v. Vaughn, 137 Ga. 671, 74 S.E. 270, 40 L.R.A. (n.s.) 542, 1913B Ann. Cas. 52 (1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3909).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Substitution generally.</b> - When specifically bequeathed capital stock is sold for money and the testator independently reinvests in stocks and certificates there is no "exchange" of property bequeathed for other of like character, as contemplated by the statute, so far as to except it from operation of the principle of ademption. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-818). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bequest of capital stock for the use and benefit of testator's wife that is subsequently sold by the testator prior to testator's death is not a fund bequested within the meaning of this statute. Woodall v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 688, 157 S.E.2d 261 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-818). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When lands exchanged were all farm land, the fact that the three tracts did not have the same acreage, and possibly not the same market value, does not prevent the tracts from being of like character.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ademption and substitution.</b> - Because the purchase of a second property closed over a year before the sale of the bequeathed property closed and the testator executed a valid codicil after the sale that did not mention either property, the bequeathed properly was deemed pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-66; consequently, there was no basis for substitution under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-67(a).

<p class="p4"><b>Statute does not apply to residuary legatees as such.</b> McGinnis v. McGinnis, 1 Ga. 496 (1846) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning and intent.</b> - Meaning and intent of this statute is that it is designed for the purpose of making sure that a legatee shall not be permitted to hold onto a legatee's own legacy under a will and at the same time deprive another legatee of property given the legatee under the will. Holliday v. Pope, 205 Ga. 301, 53 S.E.2d 350 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute is not intended and should not be construed to mean that a legatee must speculate by electing to take what the legatee believes to be a good claim to property, and at that period of pure chance relinquish the legatee's unquestioned title to the property under the will. On the other hand, the intent of this statute is to prevent such legatee from taking both the property going to the legatee under the will and property which the legatee claims. Holliday v. Pope, 205 Ga. 301, 53 S.E.2d 350 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election defined.</b> - An "election" in equity is a choice which a person is compelled to make between the acceptance of a benefit under an instrument and the retention of one's own property which is attempted to be disposed of by that instrument. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election requires prior adjudication of ownership of devised property.</b> - Plaintiff would not be compelled to elect between a legacy and a "mere claim" to property until after there has been an adjudication of the question whether or not plaintiff is in fact the owner of an interest in the property disposed of by the will, and then only in the event this issue is determined in plaintiff's favor; since, if plaintiff were first compelled to elect, and plaintiff should for any reason fail in the trial to establish plaintiff's claim, there would be no defeated or disappointed legatees to compensate, but, on the contrary, the other legatees would get the very property plaintiff claimed. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A case of election only arises when</b> a person is entitled to one of two benefits to each of which plaintiff has the legal title, and an election can exist only when there is a choice between two or more inconsistent remedies actually existing at the time of election. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>To raise a case of election a person must be entitled to one of two benefits,</b> to each of which one has legal title, but to enforce both would be unconscientious and inequitable to others having claims upon the same property or fund. One must have legal title to both benefits, and have right to enforce either at one's election. Holliday v. Pope, 205 Ga. 301, 53 S.E.2d 350 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Choice of beneficiary.</b> - When a testator, after devising property owned by the testator to one beneficiary, assumes to devise to another property belonging to the first devisee, the devisee of the property owned by the testator, if one accepts the devise with knowledge of the facts, is precluded from asserting a claim to one's own property devised to the other beneficiary. The beneficiary must elect between keeping one's own and taking what is given by the will. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Choice is compulsory between two inconsistent rights or claims when there is a clear intention of the testator that the beneficiary shall not enjoy both. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirement that will describe specific property.</b> - Doctrine of election as applied to wills, against one claiming inconsistent benefits, arises when the testator "has attempted to give property not his own, and has given a benefit to a person to whom that property belongs," in which case "the devisee or legatee shall elect either to take under or against the will." It is applicable when the instrument confers upon one a benefit while attempting to dispose of one's own property, in which event such person must elect whether to accept the benefit under the instrument or retain one's property. However, this doctrine does not apply when testamentary disposition describes no specific property so as to identify the property with that of the claimant, but describes the property only generally, as "all my real and personal property and all property of every kind and character owned by me at my death," since the testator would be presumed to have intended to bequeath only what the testator actually owned and could lawfully dispose of. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Roberts, 187 Ga. 472, 1 S.E.2d 12 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of election may prohibit specific performance of contract.</b> - Specific performance of an alleged contract to will certain property in return for services rendered testator would not be decreed if to do so would allow the petitioner to acquire both that property and the property already given to one under the will. Holliday v. Pope, 205 Ga. 301, 53 S.E.2d 350 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Condition contemplated by statute, when an election is mandatory, will exist in a suit for specific performance of a contract to will certain property to petitioner who was given other less desirable property in the will, only when by a judgment of the court the petitioner acquires legal title to the property which one seeks; and by the very act of praying for and obtaining such a decree of title the petitioner will have thereby made an election to renounce the petitioner's legacy under the will, and the requirements of statute will thus be satisfied. Holliday v. Pope, 205 Ga. 301, 53 S.E.2d 350 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-502).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exclusive Jurisdiction</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate court has original and exclusive jurisdiction.</b> - Probate court has exclusive jurisdiction of the probate of wills, and a will cannot be proved and admitted in evidence in a contest under it in the superior court. Elliott v. Johnson, 178 Ga. 384, 173 S.E. 399 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court of equity is without jurisdiction to determine the validity of wills and to cancel them. Elliott v. Johnson, 178 Ga. 384, 173 S.E. 399 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court of ordinary (now probate court) has original and exclusive jurisdiction, in the first instance, of the probate of wills; and a court of equity in the exercise of its equity powers has no jurisdiction to enjoin the custodian of an alleged will from offering the will for probate, or for any reason to decree cancellation of an alleged will on which no action has been taken by the court of ordinary (now probate court). The rule that equity seeks to do complete justice will not bring into equitable jurisdiction matters of which another court has exclusive jurisdiction. Furr v. Jordan, 196 Ga. 862, 27 S.E.2d 861 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate must occur within county of residence of decedent.</b> - It being within the power of the judge of the probate court of any county to compel the filing in the judge's office of any paper purporting to be the last will and testament of a deceased person who at the time of death resided in such county, and the probate court having original and exclusive jurisdiction in the first instance of the probate of all wills, the superior court, in the exercise of the court's equity powers, has no jurisdiction to enjoin the custodian of an alleged will from offering the will for probate, nor to decree, for any reason, the cancellation of an alleged will upon which no action has ever been taken by the probate court. Elliott v. Johnson, 178 Ga. 384, 173 S.E. 399 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When will was offered for probate in the court of ordinary (now probate court) of a certain county, as the court having jurisdiction, solely upon the ground that the decedent was domiciled in that county at the time of the decedent's death, and there was no contention that the evidence did not establish without dispute all averments contained in the application for probate, it was not cause for reversal for any reason assigned, that the court in directing the verdict in favor of probate included direction for a special finding that the decedent was a resident of and was domiciled in Fulton County at the time of the decedent's death as a general verdict for the propounders would necessarily have implied the jurisdictional fact that the decedent was so domiciled; and it did not appear that the caveator was harmed by the direction of such special finding, or by its existence as a part of the verdict. Hungerford v. Spalding, 183 Ga. 547, 189 S.E. 2 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate courts have general jurisdiction of the granting or revocation of letters of administration, and therefore judgment granting letters as to a particular estate cannot be impeached collaterally on the ground that the decedent resided in a different county; such a judgment must be attacked in the court where it was rendered, especially where the judgment itself recites the fact that the deceased was late of that county. Davis v. Tyson, 60 Ga. App. 714, 4 S.E.2d 704 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate proper in county of domicile.</b> - Probate court did not err in finding that the testators were domiciled in Newton County at the time of the testators' deaths as the testators resided in a nursing home in that county and had no plans to return to the testators' Fulton County home or to the appellant's residence in Rockdale County and, thus, the probate court properly exercised jurisdiction over the petition to probate the testators' wills. Hardee v. Whitlock, 345 Ga. App. 536, 813 S.E.2d 616 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate cannot be predicated on ownership of real estate alone.</b> - Mere ownership of real estate in a certain county would not confer jurisdiction upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) of such county to probate an alleged will, unless the decedent died a nonresident of this state, since the probate of a will must be made in the county of the residence of the alleged testator if a resident of this state; and, if not a resident of this state, the will may be probated in any county where real estate belonging to the testator is situated. Hungerford v. Spalding, 183 Ga. 547, 189 S.E. 2 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Issue to be decided on an application for probate</b> is devisavit vel non, and does not include any issue as to the validity of the testator's title. Wetter v. Habersham, 60 Ga. 193 (1878) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2421); Cone v. Johnston, 202 Ga. 420, 43 S.E.2d 545 (1947);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-603). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Issue of devisavit vel non does not include any issue as to the title or the ownership of property, and a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a superior court on appeal from a court of ordinary (now probate court) has no jurisdiction to try and determine the question of the validity or invalidity of a contract by legatees disposing of property contrary to the terms of a will offered for probate.

<p class="p4"><b>Renunciation</b> is an act whereby a person, named in a will as executor, declines to take on personally the burden of that office. The act is, therefore, predicated on an existing office. It presupposes the existence of the will. If no will has been made, there is no executorship to renounce. Nor until it is shown that there is a will, can it appear that there is a renunciable executorship. Wheeler v. Wheeler, 82 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Executor must offer will and probate court must determine validity.</b> - It is not only the duty of an individual nominated as executor under a will on the will's face to offer the will for probate, but it is the duty of the court of ordinary (now probate court), with all the parties at interest before the court, to adjudicate whether the will be in fact valid or invalid.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to compel filing of will constitutes constructive fraud against purchaser.</b> - One's failure to move in the matter of compelling another to file the alleged will after one's refusal, and to apply to have the will probated for so long a time, is such gross negligence as would amount to constructive fraud against a purchaser from the other without notice of the will and acting on faith of one's apparent title as heir at law, and would estop one and one's assigns from setting up title under the subsequently probated will as against such purchaser from the husband claiming as heir at law.

<p class="p4"><b>Time within which will must be probated.</b> - Except as to proof in solemn form after probate in common form, there is no statute of limitation upon the time within which a will may be probated, and if a will is finally offered, the will's proof and record cannot be denied upon the ground of delay by the propounder, nor because of acts on the propounder's part from which an estoppel might arise in other cases.

<p class="p4"><b>This statute is a branch of the statute of distributions,</b> and prescribes how the estate of a deceased person to this extent is to be disposed of; creditors are left out and adult children are left out, until this much of the estate is withdrawn from it, and then creditors and adult children are admitted for participation in the balance. Smith v. Sanders, 208 Ga. 405, 67 S.E.2d 229 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Provision for a year's support is a branch of the statute of distribution,</b> and the persons entitled to it are just as much and as absolutely entitled as they are in case of intestacy to a distributive share of the residue after the year's support is deducted and all debts are paid. Creditors are left out, and adult children are left out, until this much of the estate is withdrawn from it, when they are admitted for participation in the balance; they have no right to anything except by the statute of distributions. Rimes v. Graham, 199 Ga. 406, 34 S.E.2d 443 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute of distributions does not determine entitlement to year's support.</b> - Statute prescribes those who are to benefit thereunder, and the ordinary rules of inheritance designate the heirs of a decedent. Neither is dependent upon the other, and the statute of distributions does not determine who are entitled to a year's support. Woodes v. Morris, 247 Ga. 771, 279 S.E.2d 704 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adopted child entitled to year's support.</b> - In Georgia, the rules of inheritance, as fixed by statute, use the words "child" or "children" without mentioning therein an adopted child or children. Nevertheless, by virtue of the adoption statutes an adopted child or children take under the statute of descent as natural children of lawful birth. For example, under the rules of inheritance, upon the death of the husband without lineal descendants, the wife is his sole heir, and upon the payment of his debts, if any, may take possession of his estate without administration. But, under the provisions of the adoption statute and the rights of inheritance conferred by it, an adopted child of the deceased husband, like a lineal descendant of the deceased, will deprive the wife of the right to take his entire estate as sole heir at law, without administration; and this is true because the statute fixing the rules of inheritance must be construed in pari materia with the adoption statute. A similar situation exists as to the statute providing for a year's support to the widow and minor children of a deceased husband and father. Thornton v. Anderson, 207 Ga. 714, 64 S.E.2d 186 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Caveat</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>All persons interested in administration of estate may file caveat to application.</b> - Not only heirs, legatees, and creditors of an estate, but also all other persons concerned in the legal administration of the assets thereof, including a cosurety of the decedent on a bond on which suit has been brought, may interpose a caveat to an application for a year's support. Wardlaw v. Wardlaw, 41 Ga. App. 538, 154 S.E. 159 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Caveators must prove year's support is in excess of need.</b> - When caveators produce no evidence as to the standing of the family or the manner in which the deceased and the applicant had lived prior to death, caveators have failed to produce one of the necessary elements of evidence to show that the amount set aside to the applicant was more than the applicant was entitled to as a year's support. Hayes v. Hay, 92 Ga. App. 88, 88 S.E.2d 306 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Statute does not require notice to the applicant for a year's support</b> of the filing of a caveat to the application; it is the duty of the applicant to keep informed as to regular proceedings in the case, and any ignorance of such proceedings, resulting from failure to perform that duty, will not afford ground for ousting the court of the court's jurisdiction to try the issue raised by the caveat, and to set aside the judgment upon that issue. Davis v. City of Atlanta, 182 Ga. 242, 185 S.E. 279 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>3. Judgment</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Superior court appeal subject to summary judgment.</b> - An appeal of an application for a year's support award by a probate court is a de novo proceeding in the superior court and, as such, the appeal is subject to the established procedures for civil actions, thus entitling a party to invoke summary judgment. Bright v. Knecht, 182 Ga. App. 820, 357 S.E.2d 159 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support must be manifest in a judgment.</b> - Although a judgment for year's support would have ranked ahead of payment of debts, the mere fact that plaintiffs by relationship occupied a position which would entitle the plaintiffs to apply for and obtain such a judgment, would not entitle the plaintiffs, without having it allowed in the only way provided by law to have a recovery against the administrator and the administrator's surety. A year's support to be enforceable must be manifest in a judgment. It is not in existence as such until such judgment. Howard v. Davis, 192 Ga. 505, 15 S.E.2d 865 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) allowing a year's support is a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction,</b> and the presumption is that everything necessary to be done was done. Dougherty-Little-Redwine Co. v. Hatcher, 169 Ga. 858, 151 S.E. 796 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment granting year's support invulnerable to collateral attack except lack of jurisdiction.</b> - Every presumption is in favor of the judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) setting apart a year's support; and it cannot be collaterally attacked, except when the record shows want of jurisdictional facts. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When no caveat to widow's application for support was filed, and citation had issued and been published as required by law, a court of equity would not set aside the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) for irregularities. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A widow who applies for and obtains a year's support for herself and her minor children living with her, acts for the minor children as well as herself. In such case the minor children are as plaintiffs, and the judgment obtained is in their behalf. The result is that both widows and their minor children who invoke and obtain judgments granting them property out of the estates of deceased husbands and fathers cannot afterwards repudiate the judgments which they have secured for their own benefit. The position thus occupied by the minors living with their mother is very different from that of creditors, or adult heirs such as other children who were sui juris when the support was set apart. Jones v. Federal Land Bank, 189 Ga. 419, 6 S.E.2d 52 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) confirming and admitting to record the return of duly appointed appraisers, setting apart to a widow and minor children a year's support consisting of described property, "subject to just debts owed by" the deceased husband and father, is not void on the ground that the property has been set apart subject to existing debts of the deceased. Griffin v. Wood, 196 Ga. 510, 26 S.E.2d 921 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the final judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) setting apart a year's support has been rendered, it is too late to attack that judgment. Smith v. Smith, 73 Ga. App. 567, 37 S.E.2d 439 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment approving the return of commissioners setting aside a year's support, when all the proceedings are regular, cannot be attacked as fraudulent because interested parties could have successfully resisted the judgment had the parties interposed timely objection.

<p class="p4">Judgment awarding the year's support to the widow bears the presumption that everything necessary to authorize the judgment was properly done. Such judgment is not subject to a collateral attack except for a want of jurisdiction apparent on the face of the record. Stephens v. Carter, 215 Ga. 355, 110 S.E.2d 762 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When defendants in year's support action in pleading the record in the year's support proceeding, allege that the executors in their caveat interposed as a defense a marital contract and the bequest to the widow in the husband's will in lieu of a year's support, and these defenses were adjudicated adversely to the estate in prior proceeding this is binding on the defendants. Stephens v. Carter, 215 Ga. 355, 110 S.E.2d 762 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>4. Jurisdiction</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate court has general jurisdiction.</b> - In a proceeding to set apart a year's support, the court of ordinary (now probate court) is a court of general jurisdiction as to such matter. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In response to a widow's application for year's support, the probate court could only award her property belonging to her husband's estate and had no jurisdiction to determine whether the property was vested in the widow, her husband's estate, or in a bankruptcy estate. McClure v. Mason, 228 Ga. App. 797, 493 S.E.2d 16 (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Original jurisdiction of a court of ordinary (now probate court)</b> in a year's support proceeding is exclusive, and fact that the estate is in the hands of a trustee or receiver will not affect the right of the widow to proceed for it. Dougherty-Little-Redwine Co. v. Hatcher, 169 Ga. 858, 151 S.E. 796 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of bankruptcy court.</b> - Widow is entitled to a year's support under the laws of Georgia, provided the deceased husband left any property out of which, or the proceeds of which, it may be set aside to her. If the intervention of a bankruptcy proceeding prevents appropriate action by the state court having jurisdiction, then the bankruptcy court, which exercises equitable jurisdiction, should act, and do that which ought to have been done. Seiden v. Southland Chenilles, Inc., 195 F.2d 899 (5th Cir. 1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conflicting claims as to property ownership.</b> - Court of ordinary (now probate court) has no jurisdiction to try and determine conflicting claims of ownership of property, arising between a widow applying for the setting apart of a year's support and a person asserting title adversely to the estate of her deceased husband. Richey v. First Nat'l Bank, 180 Ga. 751, 180 S.E. 740 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Foreign court jurisdiction.</b> - Consent decree of a court of another state which, in part, seeks to transfer title to realty in this state that had previously been set aside to a widow and minor children as a year's support, shows upon its face that, insofar as transferring title to realty, the court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter; and accordingly, that part of the decree is not such a judgment as comes within the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. King v. King, 203 Ga. 811, 48 S.E.2d 465 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>1. Distribution Generally</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute is a branch of the statute of distributions,</b> and prescribes how the estate of a deceased person to this extent is to be disposed of; creditors are left out and adult children are left out, until this much of the estate is withdrawn from it, and then creditors and adult children are admitted for participation in the balance. Smith v. Sanders, 208 Ga. 405, 67 S.E.2d 229 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provision for a year's support is a branch of the statute of distribution,</b> and the persons entitled to it are just as much and as absolutely entitled as they are in case of intestacy to a distributive share of the residue after the year's support is deducted and all debts are paid. Creditors are left out, and adult children are left out, until this much of the estate is withdrawn from it, when they are admitted for participation in the balance; they have no right to anything except by the statute of distributions. Rimes v. Graham, 199 Ga. 406, 34 S.E.2d 443 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute of distributions does not determine entitlement to year's support.</b> - Statute prescribes those who are to benefit thereunder, and the ordinary rules of inheritance designate the heirs of a decedent. Neither is dependent upon the other, and the statute of distributions does not determine who are entitled to a year's support. Woodes v. Morris, 247 Ga. 771, 279 S.E.2d 704 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Ordinary law of distribution" and law governing year's support are entirely distinct</b> and independent. Woodes v. Morris, 247 Ga. 771, 279 S.E.2d 704 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question of whom deceased is bound by law to support is not answered by determination of one's heirs at law.</b> Woodes v. Morris, 247 Ga. 771, 279 S.E.2d 704 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adopted child entitled to year's support.</b> - In Georgia, the rules of inheritance, as fixed by statute, use the words "child" or "children" without mentioning therein an adopted child or children. Nevertheless, by virtue of the adoption statutes an adopted child or children take under the statute of descent as natural children of lawful birth. For example, under the rules of inheritance, upon the death of the husband without lineal descendants, the wife is his sole heir, and upon the payment of his debts, if any, may take possession of his estate without administration. But, under the provisions of the adoption statute and the rights of inheritance conferred by it, an adopted child of the deceased husband, like a lineal descendant of the deceased, will deprive the wife of the right to take his entire estate as sole heir at law, without administration; and this is true because the statute fixing the rules of inheritance must be construed in pari materia with the adoption statute. A similar situation exists as to the statute providing for a year's support to the widow and minor children of a deceased husband and father. Thornton v. Anderson, 207 Ga. 714, 64 S.E.2d 186 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>2. Caveat</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>All persons interested in administration of estate may file caveat to application.</b> - Not only heirs, legatees, and creditors of an estate, but also all other persons concerned in the legal administration of the assets thereof, including a cosurety of the decedent on a bond on which suit has been brought, may interpose a caveat to an application for a year's support. Wardlaw v. Wardlaw, 41 Ga. App. 538, 154 S.E. 159 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It is not necessary for an administrator to be a party to a caveat to a year's support.</b> Wardlaw v. Wardlaw, 41 Ga. App. 538, 154 S.E. 159 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Caveators must prove year's support is in excess of need.</b> - When caveators produce no evidence as to the standing of the family or the manner in which the deceased and the applicant had lived prior to death, caveators have failed to produce one of the necessary elements of evidence to show that the amount set aside to the applicant was more than the applicant was entitled to as a year's support. Hayes v. Hay, 92 Ga. App. 88, 88 S.E.2d 306 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute does not require notice to the applicant for a year's support</b> of the filing of a caveat to the application; it is the duty of the applicant to keep informed as to regular proceedings in the case, and any ignorance of such proceedings, resulting from failure to perform that duty, will not afford ground for ousting the court of the court's jurisdiction to try the issue raised by the caveat, and to set aside the judgment upon that issue. Davis v. City of Atlanta, 182 Ga. 242, 185 S.E. 279 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>3. Judgment</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Superior court appeal subject to summary judgment.</b> - An appeal of an application for a year's support award by a probate court is a de novo proceeding in the superior court and, as such, the appeal is subject to the established procedures for civil actions, thus entitling a party to invoke summary judgment. Bright v. Knecht, 182 Ga. App. 820, 357 S.E.2d 159 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support must be manifest in a judgment.</b> - Although a judgment for year's support would have ranked ahead of payment of debts, the mere fact that plaintiffs by relationship occupied a position which would entitle the plaintiffs to apply for and obtain such a judgment, would not entitle the plaintiffs, without having it allowed in the only way provided by law to have a recovery against the administrator and the administrator's surety. A year's support to be enforceable must be manifest in a judgment. It is not in existence as such until such judgment. Howard v. Davis, 192 Ga. 505, 15 S.E.2d 865 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) allowing a year's support is a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction,</b> and the presumption is that everything necessary to be done was done. Dougherty-Little-Redwine Co. v. Hatcher, 169 Ga. 858, 151 S.E. 796 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After a judgment by a court of ordinary (now probate court) setting aside a 12 months' support, that court cannot suspend or vacate such judgment merely to let in a defense which should have been offered before judgment. Dougherty-Little-Redwine Co. v. Hatcher, 169 Ga. 858, 151 S.E. 796 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment granting year's support invulnerable to collateral attack except lack of jurisdiction.</b> - Every presumption is in favor of the judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) setting apart a year's support; and it cannot be collaterally attacked, except when the record shows want of jurisdictional facts. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment setting apart a year's support is not void on the ground that the appraisers have not filed with their report a plat of the land set apart. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When no caveat to widow's application for support was filed, and citation had issued and been published as required by law, a court of equity would not set aside the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) for irregularities. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A widow who applies for and obtains a year's support for herself and her minor children living with her, acts for the minor children as well as herself. In such case the minor children are as plaintiffs, and the judgment obtained is in their behalf. The result is that both widows and their minor children who invoke and obtain judgments granting them property out of the estates of deceased husbands and fathers cannot afterwards repudiate the judgments which they have secured for their own benefit. The position thus occupied by the minors living with their mother is very different from that of creditors, or adult heirs such as other children who were sui juris when the support was set apart. Jones v. Federal Land Bank, 189 Ga. 419, 6 S.E.2d 52 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) confirming and admitting to record the return of duly appointed appraisers, setting apart to a widow and minor children a year's support consisting of described property, "subject to just debts owed by" the deceased husband and father, is not void on the ground that the property has been set apart subject to existing debts of the deceased. Griffin v. Wood, 196 Ga. 510, 26 S.E.2d 921 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the final judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) setting apart a year's support has been rendered, it is too late to attack that judgment. Smith v. Smith, 73 Ga. App. 567, 37 S.E.2d 439 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment approving the return of commissioners setting aside a year's support, when all the proceedings are regular, cannot be attacked as fraudulent because interested parties could have successfully resisted the judgment had the parties interposed timely objection. Brownlee v. Brownlee, 203 Ga. 377, 46 S.E.2d 901 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Judgment awarding the year's support to the widow bears the presumption that everything necessary to authorize the judgment was properly done. Such judgment is not subject to a collateral attack except for a want of jurisdiction apparent on the face of the record. Stephens v. Carter, 215 Ga. 355, 110 S.E.2d 762 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When defendants in year's support action in pleading the record in the year's support proceeding, allege that the executors in their caveat interposed as a defense a marital contract and the bequest to the widow in the husband's will in lieu of a year's support, and these defenses were adjudicated adversely to the estate in prior proceeding this is binding on the defendants. Stephens v. Carter, 215 Ga. 355, 110 S.E.2d 762 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>4. Jurisdiction</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate court has general jurisdiction.</b> - In a proceeding to set apart a year's support, the court of ordinary (now probate court) is a court of general jurisdiction as to such matter. Smith v. Smith, 187 Ga. 743, 2 S.E.2d 417 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In response to a widow's application for year's support, the probate court could only award her property belonging to her husband's estate and had no jurisdiction to determine whether the property was vested in the widow, her husband's estate, or in a bankruptcy estate. McClure v. Mason, 228 Ga. App. 797, 493 S.E.2d 16 (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Original jurisdiction of a court of ordinary (now probate court)</b> in a year's support proceeding is exclusive, and fact that the estate is in the hands of a trustee or receiver will not affect the right of the widow to proceed for it. Dougherty-Little-Redwine Co. v. Hatcher, 169 Ga. 858, 151 S.E. 796 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4041).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts of ordinary (now probate courts) have exclusive jurisdiction to set aside a year's support.</b> Cox v. Stowers, 204 Ga. 595, 50 S.E.2d 339 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of bankruptcy court.</b> - Widow is entitled to a year's support under the laws of Georgia, provided the deceased husband left any property out of which, or the proceeds of which, it may be set aside to her. If the intervention of a bankruptcy proceeding prevents appropriate action by the state court having jurisdiction, then the bankruptcy court, which exercises equitable jurisdiction, should act, and do that which ought to have been done. Seiden v. Southland Chenilles, Inc., 195 F.2d 899 (5th Cir. 1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conflicting claims as to property ownership.</b> - Court of ordinary (now probate court) has no jurisdiction to try and determine conflicting claims of ownership of property, arising between a widow applying for the setting apart of a year's support and a person asserting title adversely to the estate of her deceased husband. Richey v. First Nat'l Bank, 180 Ga. 751, 180 S.E. 740 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court has no jurisdiction to try conflicting claims of title to real property on an application for a year's support. Johnson v. Johnson, 199 Ga. App. 549, 405 S.E.2d 544 (1991) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Foreign court jurisdiction.</b> - Consent decree of a court of another state which, in part, seeks to transfer title to realty in this state that had previously been set aside to a widow and minor children as a year's support, shows upon its face that, insofar as transferring title to realty, the court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter; and accordingly, that part of the decree is not such a judgment as comes within the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. King v. King, 203 Ga. 811, 48 S.E.2d 465 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Caveat of will.</b> - The usual procedure is for the complaining party at interest to make application to the ordinary (now probate judge) for a citation to issue calling on the propounder to prove the will in solemn form, and then, if probate of the will in solemn form is refused, the effect is to set aside probate in common form and declare an intestacy.

<p class="p4"><b>Nature of proceeding.</b> - Under statutory law, a proceeding to probate a will in common form is a probate proceeding pure and simple, the probate and record not being conclusive upon anyone interested in the estate adversely to the will, and, if afterwards set aside, not protecting the executor in any of the executor's acts further than the payment of the debts of the estate.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate in common form conclusive upon no one until expiration of seven years.</b> - When a will is proved in common form and unattacked for seven years, it is conclusive against all parties except minor heirs. Churchill v. Corker, 25 Ga. 479 (1858) (decided under Laws 1845, Cobb's 1851 Digest, p. 348); Anderson v. Green, 46 Ga. 361 (1872); Peters v.

<p class="p4">After the lapse of seven years, a judgment of probate becomes conclusive as to the factum of due execution of the will, unless the fact appears on the will's face that it was not executed pursuant to law.

<p class="p4">Under statutory law, both adults and minors have seven years after the probate in common form within which to call for proof in solemn form. If a minor arrives at majority during the seven years next succeeding the probate, and at a time when more than four years of that period remains, the minor has, after arrival at age, the remainder of the seven-year period within which to file a contest. If the minor arrives at majority after the expiration of the seven years, or at a time during the seven-year period when less than four years remains, the minor has only four years after reaching majority to file the contest. Sutton v. Hancock, 118 Ga. 436, 45 S.E. 504 (1903) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3283). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While a judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) probating a will in common form is not without limited effect and after seven years becomes conclusive upon all persons not under disability, yet until then it is "not conclusive upon anyone interested in the estate adversely to the will, and such person . . . may require proof in solemn form and interpose a caveat."

<p class="p4"><b>Time within which will must be probated.</b> - Except as to proof in solemn form after probate in common form, there is no statute of limitations upon the time within which a will may be probated, and if a will is finally offered, its proof and record cannot be denied upon the ground of delay by the propounder, nor because of acts on the propounder's part from which an estoppel might arise in other cases.

<p class="p4"><b>Caveator was party and could not later protest.</b> - It was proper to dismiss without a hearing a caveat to a will based on lack of testamentary capacity because it was clear that the caveator's allegations were fatally deficient. The caveator had not sought to set aside the probate court's order probating the will; by signing a letter of assent, the caveator had consented to the immediate probate of the will, which established, among other things, that the testator had sufficient mental capacity; and although the caveator contended that distribution of the estate should be governed by an alleged contract between the parties, the caveator had not appealed the probate court's finding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the alleged contract. In re Estate of Brice, 288 Ga. App. 449, 654 S.E.2d 420 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Probate of a will does not decide upon the right of disposal;</b> it decides merely upon the factum of the will. Smith v. Davis, 203 Ga. 175, 45 S.E.2d 609 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of ordinary (now probate court) has original and exclusive jurisdiction</b> over the probate of wills; and the issue to be decided on an application for probate is devisavit vel non, and does not include any issue as to the validity of the testator's title. Cone v. Johnston, 202 Ga. 420, 43 S.E.2d 545 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In a proceeding to probate a will in solemn form, the only issue</b> is devisavit vel non, will or not. Smith v. Davis, 203 Ga. 175, 45 S.E.2d 609 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fact that the issue in an application for probate is devisavit vel non does not mean that proof of occurrences subsequent to the proper execution of a valid will that, in law, voids the document is inadmissible. Lawson v. Hurt, 217 Ga. 827, 125 S.E.2d 480 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-13 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Propounder who offered a will for probate</b> assumed the non-shifting burden of persuasion as to the validity of that document, including the requirement of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the signature was that of the decedent. Heard v. Lovett, 273 Ga. 111, 538 S.E.2d 434 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It was error for the superior court to direct a verdict in favor of a propounder because under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46 the propounder was required to prove that the propounder's mother did not deliberately discard or destroy the original of the will with the purpose of revoking the will, but the propounder did not satisfy the propounder's statutory duty, and the propounder should have filed a petition to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original, which would have notified the probate court of the appropriate standards and burdens of proof; the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46(b) clearly requires that the presumption of intent to revoke be rebutted in order for a copy of a will to be probated, and Georgia law does not allow a propounder to probate a will without fulfilling the pertinent evidentiary requirements, even when no caveat has been filed. Tudor v. Bradford, 289 Ga. 28, 709 S.E.2d 235 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It was error for the superior court to direct a verdict in favor of a propounder because pursuant to current Ga. Unif. Prob. Ct. R. 5.3.3 the propounder was required to provide a caption on the propounder's petition to probate a will purported to be the last will and testament of the propounder's mother that set out the exact nature of the pleading or the type of petition, which was to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original; however, not only did the propounder fail to caption the propounder's petition properly, the propounder also failed to make any interlineations or provide the requisite additional information in the petition as required by Georgia Probate Court Standard Form 5 to use that form to probate a copy of the mother's will. Tudor v. Bradford, 289 Ga. 28, 709 S.E.2d 235 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Admission of self-proved will.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-24(c), when a will is self-proved, it "may be admitted to probate without the testimony of any subscribing witness." In fact, compliance with the requirements of execution are presumed without the live testimony or affidavits of witnesses; that is, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-21(a), the affidavit creates a presumption regarding the prima facie case, subject to rebuttal. Singelman v. Singelman, 273 Ga. 894, 548 S.E.2d 343 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a sister's challenge to her brother's will, the probate court erred in finding that the will was not sufficiently proven due to the executor's failure to produce the witnesses; the will had an attached self-proving affidavit and could be admitted without other proof that formalities of execution were met, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-24.

<p class="p4"><b>Statute prescribes certain essential prerequisites</b> before a valid judgment probating a will in solemn form can be rendered. Miller v. Miller, 104 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application to probate in solemn form affords opportunity to all parties</b> interested for a hearing by the court on any objection the parties may have to the probate of the will, and those with notice are concluded by the judgment of probate. While the caveator has the burden of proving the grounds of the caveat, the initial burden is upon the propounder to prove the testamentary capacity of the testator, and that the testator acted freely and voluntarily in the execution of the will. Jones v. Dean, 188 Ga. 319, 3 S.E.2d 894 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proper attestation clause presumes statutory execution of will.</b> - Attestation clause stating that testator signed will "in the presence of witnesses who, at her request and in her presence and in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses the same day and date," is a sufficient attestation clause such that its introduction into evidence raised a presumption of the proper execution of the will. Thornton v. Hulme, 218 Ga. 480, 128 S.E.2d 744 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment of probate and domicile is a judgment in rem</b> and therefore, as an act of the sovereign power, its effect cannot be disputed within the jurisdiction. Riley v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate of later will requires</b> prior reversal of judgment ordering probate of first will. When a person who filed a caveat to a will which was probated in solemn form thereafter attempted to probate an alleged later will, without setting aside or reversing the judgment ordering the probate of the first will in solemn form, a verdict was demanded against probate of the alleged later will. Byrd v. Riggs, 209 Ga. 930, 76 S.E.2d 774 (1953), for comment, see 16 Ga. B.J. 338 (1954); 18 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof generally.</b> - Proof of the execution of a will in case of probate in solemn form and proof of the execution of a will in a case to establish and probate a copy when the will is missing may be made in precisely the same manner and by the same character of evidence; and in both evidence other than the testimony of the subscribing witnesses, after the available witnesses have been produced at the hearing, is admissible for the purpose of proving the execution of the will, and in each this may be done despite the testimony of the witnesses against the will. Fletcher v. Gillespie, 201 Ga. 377, 40 S.E.2d 45 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof may be made in any legal form.</b> - Law directs that on an application to probate in solemn form the proof be made by the witnesses, yet such proof may be made by any legal evidence, and is not limited to the testimony of the subscribing witnesses, and despite the fact that the witnesses may testify against the will. Fletcher v. Gillespie, 201 Ga. 377, 40 S.E.2d 45 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Propounder must make prima facie case as to factum of will.</b> - On the trial of an issue arising upon the propounding of a will and a caveat thereto, the burden, in the first instance, is on the propounder to make out a prima facie case by showing the factum of the will, and that at the time of the will's execution the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make the will, and, in making the will, acted freely and voluntarily. Spivey v. Spivey, 202 Ga. 644, 44 S.E.2d 224 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Personal appearance by all available witnesses not required.</b> - Propounder of a will is required only to prove the will in accordance with O.C.G.A. Ch. 11, T. 9, which does not, of necessity, require personal appearance by all available witnesses in solemn form proceeding. Norton v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust, 248 Ga. 847, 285 S.E.2d 910 (1982), aff'd, 253 Ga. 596, 322 S.E.2d 870 (1984) ???

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prima-facie case of will's authenticity made.</b> - When the record of the superior court proceedings shows that the record of the probate court, where the will was shown to be executed with requisite formalities, was brought up and introduced into evidence, this probate record included a photostatic copy of the original will, which original was retained by the clerk of the probate court as required by former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-5, and according to the two attesting witnesses to the will, the testator apparently had sufficient mental capacity to make the testator's will and in making the will acted freely and voluntarily in 1972, the propounder made out a prima facie case, showing the factum of the will and that the will was freely and voluntarily executed. Pendley v. Pendley, 251 Ga. 30, 302 S.E.2d 554 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-13).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Bank &amp; Trust, 248 Ga. 847, 285 S.E.2d 910 (1982), aff'd, 253 Ga. 596, 322 S.E.2d 870 (1984) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-13).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Production of witnesses indispensable to prima facie case by propounder.</b> - Probate in solemn form requires that "all the witnesses" be produced, if the witnesses be in life and within the jurisdiction of the court; if a will has four witnesses, all must be produced if the witnesses are accessible. Bloodworth v. McCook, 193 Ga. 53, 17 S.E.2d 73 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602); Miller v. Miller, 104 Ga. App. 224, 121 S.E.2d 340 (1961);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To make out a prima facie case, where a caveat has been filed and to be entitled to a judgment of probate in solemn form, the propounder must introduce at the hearing all the subscribing witnesses, if living and accessible, or proof of their signatures, if dead or inaccessible.

<p class="p4">If a caveat has been filed all subscribing witnesses must be introduced for examination, even though the propounder knows that the witnesses' testimony will be unfavorable to the propounder, and if some or all of the subscribing witnesses cannot testify as to the testamentary capacity and mental condition of the testator, or give testimony adverse to the propounder and favorable to the caveator, such failure of memory or hostility will not necessarily defeat the will, since the propounder may make the proof required by law by other witnesses who can testify as to the essential facts, and upon sufficient proof being made the will may be probated. Spivey v. Spivey, 202 Ga. 644, 44 S.E.2d 224 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To make out a prima facie case, and to be entitled to a judgment of probate in solemn form, the propounder must introduce at the hearing all the subscribing witnesses, if living and accessible, or proof of their signatures, if dead or inaccessible. Ehlers v. Rheinberger, 204 Ga. 226, 49 S.E.2d 535 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To be entitled to a judgment of probate in solemn form, the propounder must introduce at the hearing all the subscribing witnesses, if living and accessible, or proof of their signatures, if dead or inaccessible. The witnesses must be introduced, for examination, even though the propounder knows that their testimony will be unfavorable to the propounder. Miller v. Miller, 104 Ga.

<p class="p4">Upon the trial of an application to prove a will in solemn form, the witnesses are, all of them, unless accounted for, indispensably necessary witnesses. Miller v. Miller, 104 Ga. App. 224, 121 S.E.2d 340 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When four persons affixed their signature below the signature of the testator and three were present at the probate proceedings and testified (the fourth was out of the state and her signature was proved by her mother), all four persons were properly accounted for.

<p class="p4"><b>Probating in solemn form.</b> - Will cannot be probated in solemn form upon the affidavits of the subscribing witnesses to the will. Miller v. Miller, 104 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When witness outside jurisdiction of court, proof of signature may substitute for presence.</b> - When a witness is inaccessible at the time of probate in solemn form by reason of being without the jurisdiction of the state, proof of the witness's signature may be made. Dennis v. McCrary, 237 Ga. 605, 229 S.E.2d 367 (1976) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presence of witnesses affords opportunity for cross-examination.</b> - Main reason of the rule for calling all witnesses in a proceeding for probate in solemn form is to give the other party an opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses. Miller v. Miller, 104 Ga. App. 224, 121 S.E.2d 340 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prima facie case by propounder shifts burden of proof to caveator.</b> - When propounder, in will contest, established the factum of the will and codicil and by proof of the attendant circumstances indicating mental capacity and freedom of will and action, a prima facie case for the validity of the will and codicil was made such as would shift the burden upon the caveator to show that the instruments were invalid by reason of a degree of undue influence exercised upon the testator, such as would deprive the testator of the testator's own free will and substitute therefor that of the beneficiary. Ehlers v. Rheinberger, 204 Ga. 226, 49 S.E.2d 535 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate of self-proved will upheld.</b> - Because testimony from the attorney who prepared and witnessed the decedent's self-proved will, an associate who also witnessed the will's execution, and the legal secretary who notarized the will supported a finding that the decedent had the testamentary capacity at the time the will was executed, the trial court did not err in admitting the will to probate. Tuttle v. Ryan, 282 Ga. 652, 653 S.E.2d 50 (2007) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-13).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Continuing duty to give notice.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-3-13 required the propounder of any will to give notice to the propounders and beneficiaries of any other wills of the testator offered for probate in the same county. This duty of notice does not end on the date of the filing of the first will for probate. It is a duty which continues until a will is admitted to probate. Garner v.

<p class="p4"><b>Reasonable diligence in ascertaining heirs required.</b> - Legislature undoubtedly meant that before a propounder might correctly state that heirs were "unknown," the propounder must have exercised at least some reasonable diligence in ascertaining the heirs, and may not simply rely upon the propounder's personal knowledge without reasonable inquiry.

<p class="p4"><b>Admission of self-proved will.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-24(c), when a will is self-proved, the will "may be admitted to probate without the testimony of any subscribing witness." In fact, compliance with the requirements of execution are presumed without the live testimony or affidavits of witnesses; that is, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-21(a), the affidavit creates a presumption regarding the prima facie case, subject to rebuttal. Singelman v. Singelman, 273 Ga. 894, 548 S.E.2d 343 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Subscribing witnesses could testify by written interrogatories.</b> - Child's claim that a probate court erred by allowing the subscribing witnesses to testify by written interrogatories was rejected as even in the case of a will that was not self-proved, witnesses to the will could be examined by written interrogatories. Tanksley v. Parker, 278 Ga. 877, 608 S.E.2d 596 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Directed verdict for the caveators of a will was improper, although the witnesses to the will had died, given prior testimony from one witness by interrogatory and deposition that the decedent, who was blind, had signed the will voluntarily and knew it was the decedent's will; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-23(a), this evidence presented a jury question.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to caption petition.</b> - It was error for the superior court to direct a verdict in favor of a propounder because pursuant to current Ga. Unif. Prob. Ct. R. 5.3.3 the propounder was required to provide a caption on the propounder's petition to probate a will purported to be the last will and testament of the propounder's mother that set out the exact nature of the pleading or the type of petition, which was to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original; however, not only did the propounder fail to caption the propounder's petition properly, the propounder also failed to make any interlineations or provide the requisite additional information in the petition as required by Georgia Probate Court Standard Form 5 to use that form to probate a copy of the mother's will. Tudor v. Bradford, 289 Ga. 28, 709 S.E.2d 235 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Propounder who offered a will for probate.</b> - It was error for the superior court to direct a verdict in favor of a propounder because under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46, the propounder was required to prove that the propounder's mother did not deliberately discard or destroy the original of the will with the purpose of revoking the will, but the propounder did not satisfy the propounder's statutory duty, and the propounder should have filed a petition to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original, which would have notified the probate court of the appropriate standards and burdens of proof; the plain language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-46(b) clearly requires that the presumption of intent to revoke be rebutted in order for a copy of a will to be probated, and Georgia law does not allow a propounder to probate a will without fulfilling the pertinent evidentiary requirements, even when no caveat has been filed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Approval of trust necessary for approval of settlement.</b> - Trust was a beneficiary affected by a proposed settlement of a probate dispute as the trust was named as a beneficiary of the will; since the trust had not consented to a proposed settlement of the probate dispute, there was no valid settlement among all of the beneficiaries, and the trial court erred in approving the settlement over the trustees' objections.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Settlement set aside.</b> - Because the probate court erred in finding that a settlement agreement between heirs to their decedent parent's estate was enforceable, given that a disabled sibling's interests were not represented, and no evidence was presented that a non-disabled sibling assented to or participated in the agreement, the court erred in approving the agreement, warranting a finding that the agreement be set aside.

<p class="p4"><b>Settlement agreement prerequisite.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-5-25 did not apply when a pro se case filed to invalidate a decedent's will and to terminate a trust and partnership agreement created in conjunction with the will did not involve a settlement agreement or the category of persons protected by the statute.

<p class="p4"><b>Payment by estate of executor's expenses.</b> - Probate court did not err in authorizing payment by the estate of an executor's expenses in probating a testator's will because there was evidence that the executor had reasonable grounds to believe that the will the executor propounded was valid and operative, and the probate court found no evidence of any undue influence affecting the testator in the execution of the propounded will, much less undue influence of appellee on the testator.

<p class="p4">Mere fact that a propounder of an earlier will attempts to "defeat" a later will does not prove the propounder did not act in good faith, and lack of good faith is not conclusively proved by the fact that the propounder of an earlier will has a "personal interest" in the will.

<p class="p4"><b>Execution according to Georgia law.</b> - Although a foreign will, which has been admitted to probate in the state where the testator lived at the time of death, may be probated in this state by the "production of an exemplification of the probate proceedings", the probate of a foreign will in Georgia is a nullity as respects real estate in Georgia where the will is attested by only two witnesses, and not by three witnesses as required by the former laws of Georgia. Gibson v. Gaines, 46 Ga. App. 458, 167 S.E. 782 (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3871, 3873 and 3874). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Administrator with the will annexed of a foreign will attested to by only two witnesses and not three as required by Georgia law, which has been probated in Georgia could not, by virtue of such probate, administer on real estate in Georgia and, where the administrator probated such foreign will in a court of ordinary (now probate court) in Georgia, in the manner as required by law, and at the same time made application for leave to sell, for the purpose of paying debts, real estate located in Georgia, it was a valid objection to such order of sale interposed by an heir at law of the testator that the probate of the will in Georgia was a nullity because it was not executed in accordance with the former laws of Georgia. Gibson v. Gaines, 46 Ga. App. 458, 167 S.E. 782 (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3871, 3873 and 3874).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters "LDPS," standing for lineal descendants per stirpes. This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of personal representative.</b> - When the statute did not resolve a contest for appointment as personal representative, and the appellate court was not provided a transcript of the proceedings before the trial court, the appellate court had to presume the evidence before the trial court authorized the court's judgment that the appointment of the person the court selected was in the best interests of the estate.

<p class="p4"><b>Selection of most nearly related relative.</b> - Selection of intestate's daughter, rather than a grandson, to act as administrator was proper because the daughter was nearer to the intestate by blood and two of the three next of kin who were distributees had selected the daughter to so act.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of divorce or separation.</b> - Surviving spouse is not entitled to serve as administrator of her estranged spouse's estate merely because the couple's divorce decree was not made the final order of the court at the time of spouse's death. Simpson v. King, 259 Ga. 420, 383 S.E.2d 120 (1989) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-6-24).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of pending divorce.</b> - When there was a divorce pending at the time of decedent's death, the surviving spouse was disqualified to act as administrator but, since the decedent died without lineal heirs, such disqualification did not change the spouse's status as the sole heir; neither decedent's father nor decedent's siblings were "next of kin" interested in the estate as distributees and the father had no standing to challenge the probate court's proper appointment of the county administrator as administrator of the estate.

With respect to any heir who is not sui juris, consent may be given by the guardian of the individual.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-6-24 and 53-6-25 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Selection of most nearly related relative.</b> - Selection of intestate's daughter, rather than a grandson, to act as administrator was proper because the daughter was nearer to the intestate by blood and two of the three next of kin who were distributees had selected the daughter to so act. Brannen v. Boyce, 190 Ga. App. 385, 378 S.E.2d 743 (1989) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-6-24).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of divorce or separation.</b> - Surviving spouse is not entitled to serve as administrator of her estranged spouse's estate merely because the couple's divorce decree was not made the final order of the court at the time of spouse's death. Simpson v. King, 259 Ga. 420, 383 S.E.2d 120 (1989) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-6-24).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of pending divorce.</b> - When there was a divorce pending at the time of decedent's death, the surviving spouse was disqualified to act as administrator but, since the decedent died without lineal heirs, such disqualification did not change the spouse's status as the sole heir; neither decedent's father nor decedent's siblings were "next of kin" interested in the estate as distributees and the father had no standing to challenge the probate court's proper appointment of the county administrator as administrator of the estate. McClinton v. Sullivan, 263 Ga. 711, 438 S.E.2d 71 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-6-24).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creditors may not appoint non-creditor.</b> - When appointee was not a creditor of the estate, the appointee was not qualified to be appointed by the estate's creditors under paragraph (6) of former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-6-24. General Accident Ins. Co. v. Wells, 179 Ga. App. 440, 346 S.E.2d 886 (1986) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-6-24).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Beneficiaries' right to choose administrator.</b> - Because the statute did not declare that all the beneficiaries under a will must agree to the naming of an administrator with will annexed, the rule of construction in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(d)(5), that a joint authority given to any number of persons or officers may be executed by a majority of them unless it is otherwise declared applied. Dismuke v. Dismuke, 195 Ga. App. 613, 394 S.E.2d 371 (1990), cert. denied, 1995 Ga. LEXIS 1050 (1995), cert. denied, 1999 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revocation of letters of administration.</b> - Since the findings and conclusions of the probate court established that a former spouse's marital status was not correctly stated in the former spouse's application for letters of administration, and that this incorrect information was a material factor in the issuance of those letters, it was not an abuse of discretion to remove the former spouse as administrator of the deceased's estate. In re Estate of Dunn, 236 Ga. App. 211, 511 S.E.2d 575 (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-6-24 and 53-6-25).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The duties and powers of the personal representative commence upon qualification. Such powers relate back to give acts performed by the personal representative prior to qualification that are beneficial to the estate the same effect as those acts performed after qualification. The personal representative may ratify and accept on behalf of the estate acts that are done by others that would have been proper acts for the personal representative. A personal representative is a fiduciary who, in addition to the specific duties imposed by law, is under a general duty to settle the estate as expeditiously and with as little sacrifice of value as is reasonable under all of the circumstances. The personal representative shall use the authority and powers conferred by law, by the terms of any will under which the personal representative is acting, by any order of court in proceedings to which the personal representative is a party, and by the rules generally applicable to fiduciaries to act in the best interests of all persons who are interested in the estate and with due regard for their respective rights. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the petition for letters testamentary or letters of administration or by separate petition, the beneficiaries of a testate estate or the heirs of an intestate estate may, by unanimous consent, authorize but not require the probate court to grant to the personal representative any of the powers contained in Code Section 53-12-261. With respect to any beneficiary or heir who is not sui juris, the consent may be given by the guardian. The personal representative of a deceased beneficiary or heir shall be authorized to consent on behalf of that beneficiary or heir. The grant of powers shall only be ordered after publication of a citation and without any objection being filed. The citation shall be sufficient if it states generally that the petition requests that powers contained in Code Section 53-12-261 be granted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distribution improper.</b> - Trial court erred in holding that a distribution proposed by an executor did not violate the terms of the decedent's will, as in manipulating the distribution so that the executor did not gain control of the family company, the executor was elevating the executor's own interests over that of the beneficiary in violation of the executor's duty under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53- 7-1(a). Harp v. Pryor, 276 Ga. 478, 578 S.E.2d 424 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Removal of executor upheld.</b> - Probate court order removing an executor from an estate and ordering the executor to forfeit $79,000 in commissions and fees received and costs incurred as executor and attorney for the estate was upheld on appeal because: (1) the record showed that the attorney filed a purported estate accounting six inches thick, which was prepared by the staff and which the attorney showed little familiarity with; (2) the attorney delayed a distribution to a beneficiary by trying to force the beneficiary to create a trust, which was not required by the decedent's will; (3) the attorney filed an erroneous tax return that had to be amended as well as took a deduction the attorney knew was improper; and (4) the attorney incurred unnecessary expenses and fees by showing the decedent's house when the sale of the house was not required by the will. In re Estate of Arnsdorff, 273 Ga. App. 612, 615 S.E.2d 758 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to carry out duties.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-55(1) in removing the executor as executor of the decedent's estate, as the executor did not carry out the duties under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-1(a); the executor did not take control of assets of the estate, the executor commingled estate funds with the executor's own funds, and the executor sold the decedent's house without obtaining an appraisal or attempting to realize the best price on the open market. In re Estate of Zeigler, 273 Ga. App. 269, 614 S.E.2d 799 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Executor's breach of fiduciary duty.</b> - In circumstances in which an estate executor used a power of attorney before the executor's mother's death to add the executor's name to bank accounts and a certificate of deposit, eventually taking all of the money from those accounts for the executor's own without reporting that money as part of the estate, a probate court was authorized to order the executor to turn over that money to the estate; after the executor was appointed to handle the estate, the executor knew that the executor possessed money that should have been in the estate, knowledge the executor gained by being the person who removed it from the estate, and the executor's retention of those funds promoted the executor's own interest to injury of beneficiaries of the estate, and thus was a breach of the executor's fiduciary duty. Greenway v. Hamilton, 280 Ga. 652, 631 S.E.2d 689 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court order removing an executor for cause was affirmed because the executor violated the executor's fiduciary duty in numerous ways by failing to dissolve the estate business, using estate property and funds for the executor's own benefit and to pay personal bills, overpaying executor's fees, and having a conflict of interest by continuing to operate the business despite the estate losing money but personally benefiting by using the business property rent free. Myers v. Myers, 297 Ga. 490, 775 S.E.2d 145 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the parties entered into a High-Low settlement agreement that was silent as to how the funds should be allocated between the wrongful death claim and the claims of the decedent's estate, the decedent's wife, who was also the administrator of the decedent's estate, acted in contravention of the wife's fiduciary duties to the children by arguing that none of the settlement funds should be allocated to the wrongful death claim, and the trial court erred by failing to allocate any of the settlement funds to the wrongful death claim because the trial court was not allowed to consider the decedent's wishes in apportioning the claims as the children had an absolute right to share in any recovery on that claim. Leanhart v. Knox, 351 Ga. App. 268, 830 S.E.2d 545 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fulfillment of fiduciary duties.</b> - Finding that an executor fulfilled the executor's fiduciary duties pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-1(a) was not clearly erroneous because the executor was timely in the executor's distributions and properly distributed assets. In re Estate of Long, 307 Ga. App. 896, 706 S.E.2d 704 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Administrator's deed proper.</b> - In a purchaser's quiet title action against the executor of a testator's estate, the trial court did not err in adopting the report of a special master and in decreeing that fee simple title to the land was vested in the purchaser because it was the clear intent of the testator to give to the testator's nephew a limited fee to the property based on the contingency that the nephew live on the property, and if the nephew did not, the property was to revert to the estate; the executor was obligated to give effect to the clear intent of the testator to convey only a limited fee to the nephew, and upon a nonoccurrence of the contingency stated in the will, the property automatically reverted to the estate, and the administrator's deed from the executor to the nephew referenced the testator's will and perfected the limited estate. Mann v. Blalock, 286 Ga. 541, 690 S.E.2d 375 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No authority existed for administratrix to sign arbitration agreement on behalf of disabled child.</b> - Order compelling arbitration was reversed because the administratrix of an adult child, who was an incapacitated person, had no authority to sign the arbitration agreement as the child did not personally assent and there was no evidence that the administratrix had actual authority as there existed no power of attorney or any other document authorizing the administratrix to sign the arbitration agreement or to take any action on the child's behalf.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a probate court's order removing an executor;</b> the relevant question in reviewing a removal order regarding an executor is whether the trial court had grounds to conclude that there was good cause for the removal. In re Estate of Arnsdorff, 273 Ga. App. 612, 615 S.E.2d 758 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inventory as admission.</b> - Inventory required by law to be made and returned by an administrator is an admission, though not a conclusive one, of possession of such assets of an intestate as are therein described. Ellis v. McWilliams, 70 Ga. App. 195, 27 S.E.2d 886 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1402).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Administrator may explain any mistake or error in the inventory,</b> or may show that the administrator's intestate had no title to the property inventoried. The administrator's inventory of assets as belonging to the administrator's intestate puts the burden on the administrator to show its incorrectness. Ellis v. McWilliams, 70 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exemption from filing inventory.</b> - Because an estate's executors were exempted by the terms of the testator's will from the duty to file an accounting or inventory, a creditor of the estate was not entitled to compel the executors to file such reports. O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-7-33 and 53-7-69 did not provide for a cause of action but simply noted that the executors were not unaccountable for injury based on the exemption.

<p class="p4"><b>Prima facie proof of ownership by estate.</b> - Inventory and appraisement, when properly filed and recorded in the office of the court of ordinary (now probate court), is prima facie proof as to the property owned by the deceased at the time of death, and an estimate of the value thereof. If not a true inventory and appraisal, the burden is upon the removed administrator to prove that it is not correct, and account to the ordinary (now probate judge) for the items which the administrator listed and submitted to the appraisers, and which the administrator verified as correct.

<p class="p11">A testator may, by will, dispense with the necessity of the personal representative's making an inventory to the probate court or the beneficiaries or both, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or persons other than beneficiaries under the will. If a will was executed in another state and the will is valid in this state and under the laws of the state where the will was executed the personal representative would not have been required to file inventories or if the will otherwise expresses an intent to relieve the personal representative from all reporting requirements, such a will shall be construed as dispensing with the necessity of inventories in Georgia, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or parties other than beneficiaries under the will. In all wills, regardless of the date of execution, relief from making inventory with the court shall also relieve the personal representative from sending a copy of the inventory to the beneficiaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No preference within designated priority.</b> - Though at common law, the administrator might select among creditors of equal degree, and one of them might get a priority over the others by getting a judgment, under this statute, debts have their dignity fixed at the death of the intestate. The administrator has no right to pay one creditor of equal dignity to the detriment of another, nor can one creditor, in case of a deficiency of assets, get the preference of another by getting a prior judgment. Green v. Allen, 45 Ga. 205 (1872) (decided under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2494). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Priority of debts against an estate is controlled by this statute and no preference among those within a designated priority may be given by an administrator or executor. Cannon v. Tant, 229 Ga. 771, 195 S.E.2d 15 (1972) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When an administrator pays debts of an inferior rank,</b> the administrator's liability may be enforced only in favor of a creditor having a superior claim and injured by the making of such payment. Gwinn v. Trotter, 112 Ga. 703, 38 S.E. 49 (1901) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3424).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 113-1010 affected property rights and must be strictly construed,</b> and under such a construction it does not amend former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508 except as to the particular therein stated and provided for, which is to make a year's support for the family of a deceased person inferior to the lien or claim of a vendor for the purchase money of land. King v. Dalton, 85 Ga. App. 641, 69 S.E.2d 907 (1952), for comment, see 15 Ga. B.J. 211 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 113-1010 did not attempt or purport to regulate or change</b> the general law as to the priority of the payment of the debts of a deceased person as set forth in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508. King v. Dalton, 85 Ga. App. 641, 69 S.E.2d 907 (1952), for comment, see 15 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fixation at death.</b> - Priorities of creditors are fixed at the time of the death of the intestate, and this status of creditors cannot be changed by any action of an individual creditor, but each is entitled to the payment of each claim against the estate according to its priority as fixed at the time of the intestate's death. Auld v. Schmelz, 201 Ga. 42, 39 S.E.2d 39 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the lifetime of the decedent, judgments are ranked according to seniority. But after death the rendition of a judgment against an administrator would not confer any priority on the claim which formed its basis, or changed its rank. Cannon v. Tant, 229 Ga. 771, 195 S.E.2d 15 (1972) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debts and legacies stand on precisely the same footing</b> in regard to priority and one can no more be diminished by the payment of commissions than the other. The expenses of administration, among which are the commissions of the representative, must first be paid whether enough be left to satisfy debts and legacies, or not. Alston v. United States, 228 F. Supp. 216 (N.D. Ga. 1964), aff'd; 349 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1965) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Creditor cannot get a preferred lien on the assets of an estate</b> as against other creditors of equal degree by getting the first judgment against the administrator. Auld v. Schmelz, 201 Ga. 42, 39 S.E.2d 39 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Superiority of rights of creditors.</b> - Rights of creditors must always be superior to the testamentary devises. Charles Broadway Rouss, Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank, 180 Ga. 244, 178 S.E. 732 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1509).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment would vitiate the priority set forth in statute.</b> - To permit a judgment creditor to proceed to collect a judgment by garnishment, during the time permitted by law for the executor to marshal the assets of the estate and determine the claims against the estate, would be to vitiate the priority set forth in this statute. Professional Disct. Corp. v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 424, 156 S.E.2d 80 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment based on a verdict against an executor,</b> in a suit for specific performance brought originally against the testator, under a prayer for damages in lieu of specific performance, on the ground that the defendant was not in a position to specifically perform an agreement, is based on an unliquidated demand within the meaning of this statute governing priority in the payment of claims against the estate of a decedent. Benfield v. McMillan, 188 Ga. 52, 2 S.E.2d 600 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assent to legacy presumed proper.</b> - Although the trustee had not lost or dissipated by mismanagement the fund which the trustee held in a fiduciary capacity as guardian, and although in allowing this fund to remain on deposit, until the trustee's death, in a bank and while it was a solvent institution, the trustee may have exercised the care required of the trustee as a fiduciary, the trustee's estate, after the trustee's death, nevertheless, became liable to the owner or beneficiary of the fund in accordance with the priorities established by law for the payment of the debts of a decedent. Steed's Adm'x v. Steed, 40 Ga. App. 380, 149 S.E. 918 (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since there is a presumption of law that executors act legally rather than illegally and do the things that they should do rather than those that they should not do, an assent by an executor to a legacy, in derogation of the rights of creditors, will not be presumed or implied, in the absence of plain and unequivocal facts upon which such an implied assent is based. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1509).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An assent once given to a devise is irrevocable</b> as a general rule and perfects the inchoate title to the property in the devisee, if the assets of the estate may prove insufficient to pay the debts, in which case the remedy of an unpaid creditor is, generally, not to have the devised land subjected to a sale under an order of the ordinary (now probate judge), or under a judgment against the executor, but to follow the property into the hands of the devisee and there subject it at law or equity to the payment of the claim. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1509).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Check may in a proper action be used as evidence</b> in support of the payee's claim of indebtedness against the decedent but not as evidence of the indebtedness itself; and when the check was merely a gift or otherwise without consideration, the payee would have no valid claim against the estate. Lambeth v. Lewis, 114 Ga. App. 191, 150 S.E.2d 462 (1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Being a mere order to pay which has been revoked by the death of the drawer, a check in the hands of the original payee does not constitute a debt under this statute for which the decedent's estate would be liable so as to authorize a suit on the check itself; but the payee "is remitted to any underlying claim he may have against the decedent." Lambeth v. Lewis, 114 Ga. App. 191, 150 S.E.2d 462 (1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Payment of purchase money required.</b> - When the purchaser of land under a bond for title or other executory contract of sale agrees therein to pay the purchase money thereof and the taxes thereon, and the purchaser is put in possession of the land, and the equitable interest of the purchaser is set apart as a year's support to his widow and minor children, the widow would have to pay off the purchase-money debt, including the taxes which accrued on the property, before she would be entitled to enjoy such equitable interest against the claim of the state and county for taxes due on the land. Beaton v. Ware County, 171 Ga. 798, 156 S.E. 672 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Widow's right to a year's support in personal property is not superior to the right of a creditor of the deceased in the property where it has been conveyed to him by the deceased under a bill of sale to secure debt, although the bill of sale was never recorded. Philpot v. Ramsey &amp; Hogan, 47 Ga. App. 635, 171 S.E. 204 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a factor occupied, as to the landlord, the position of a bona fide acquisitor of a mortgage lien on the property, for value and without notice, and, so far as was there held, possessed only a lien upon the property for the advancements made, such lien, when no title passed, had no priority over the lien given by statute on the property of the deceased at the time of his death to the widow and minor children for a year's support. Philpot v. Ramsey &amp; Hogan, 47 Ga. App. 635, 171 S.E. 204 (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, after the death of the grantor in three security deeds, the equity of redemption was set apart to his widow and minor child, and thereafter the property was sold at public sale under an execution in favor of the first security-deed holder who announced that all liens against the property would be settled from the proceeds, and all lienholders and claimants were made parties to and asserted their liens against the fund produced at such sale in a suit to determine the order of distribution, after the payment of the costs of sale the year's support claim was entitled to the full amount of the equity of redemption. Tax claims which had attached to the property before the setting apart of the year's support were entitled to preference over the security-deed holders to the extent that the tax claims were in excess of the portion of the taxes that could and should have been paid from the equity of redemption in the absence of a year's support, and the security-deed holders were entitled to the full amount of their secured debt, less the taxes in excess of the equity. Minchew v. Juniata College, 188 Ga. 517, 4 S.E.2d 212 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">In a case where a widow has made application for year's support, the appraisers have filed their return, and citation has been published, and a creditor of the deceased husband appears at the proper time and place for the purpose of filing objections on appropriate grounds, and upon agreement of counsel that if objections are not filed the creditor's claim may, by judgment of the ordinary (now probate judge) on the return, be placed in superior rank by reducing the estate awarded the widow, under principles of estoppel pleaded against her she may not thereafter in an equitable proceeding question the validity of such judgment. Lunsford v. Kersey, 191 Ga. 738, 13 S.E.2d 803 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Death of grantee with obligation to grantor.</b> - When a grantee takes title to real property conveyed by a deed upon consideration that the grantee will furnish a home to the grantor and her husband as long as they live, and the grantee dies, with the grantor and her husband surviving, and the grantee has until the grantee's death performed the obligation so cast upon the grantee, but the grantee's estate is insolvent, the grantee's widow may claim the property conveyed as a year's support, as against the effort of the grantor to have the conveyance rescinded in equity. House v. House, 191 Ga. 678, 13 S.E.2d 817 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Executors are presumed to have knowledge of the condition of the estate;</b> it is their duty to have such knowledge; it was no defense to the year's support proceeding that claims against the estate inferior in rank to a year's support had been paid.

<p class="p6"><b>2. Enforceability</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support unenforceable unless manifested in judgment.</b> - Although a judgment for year's support would have ranked ahead of payment of debts, the mere fact that plaintiffs by relationship occupied a position which would entitle them to apply for and obtain such a judgment, would not entitle them, without having it allowed in the only way provided by law, to have a recovery against the administrator and the administrator's surety. A year's support to be enforceable must be manifest in a judgment. It is not in existence as such until such judgment. Howard v. Davis, 192 Ga. 505, 15 S.E.2d 865 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>3. Executory Contracts</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Executory contract of sale superior to year's support.</b> - Year's support is not superior to the claim of a creditor of the decedent, who holds title to the land as vendor thereof under an executory contract of sale, or under a deed to secure debt. So, when the vendor conveys the property to another, and takes a mortgage to secure the purchase money, the claim of the vendor is superior to a year's support. Beaton v. Ware County, 171 Ga. 798, 156 S.E. 672 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>4. Judgment Claims</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interest of year's support superior to judgment claim.</b> - Giving effect to this statute means that a judgment claim may not be asserted in whole or in part so long as the interest of a year's support is involved. Farmers Fertilizer Co. v. J.R. Watkins Co., 199 Ga. 49, 33 S.E.2d 294 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>5. Prior Liens</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support inferior to prior liens.</b> - While it is true that, except as to conveyances of title to secure debt, a year's support is superior to liens created by a decedent, or liens arising by operation of law during his ownership, and the widow thus takes the interest of the decedent stripped of all such inferior claims, the title of the widow to the property set apart as a year's support is not superior to liens which had already adhered against the property before the decedent husband acquired it. Paulk v. City of Ocilla, 188 Ga. 69, 2 S.E.2d 642 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the record establishes that although the husband died several years before the assessments were made, his estate was still in process of administration, and the lots were still held by his executors for the purpose of administration, at the time the liens arose, and that the application for year's support was not filed until after the assessments had thus been made against the property as a part of the estate of the decedent; in these circumstances, the assessments and executions would constitute "claims against the estate". The year's support was therefore entitled to priority, insofar as accrual of the liens after the husband's death is concerned. Johnson v. City of Blackshear, 196 Ga. 652, 27 S.E.2d 316 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Perfected security interest required.</b> - In the absence of evidence that defendants had a perfected security interest in corporate stock prior to the death of the owner, when the stock had been set aside as a year's support for the owner's wife by order of the probate court, defendant's interest in the stock was extinguished at the time the year's support award was made. Auto Alignment Servs., Inc. v. Bray, 214 Ga. App. 53, 446 S.E.2d 753 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-91).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Gross v. Shankle, 97 Ga. App. 631, 104 S.E.2d 145 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>7. Acceptance of Property in Lieu of Year's Support</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract to accept property in lieu of year's support not binding.</b> - When a widow, who is under the law entitled to a year's support, enters into a contract with the executors of her husband's estate, in which she agrees to accept certain property in lieu of a year's support, the contract is not binding on her unless it is free from fraud and is made by her with knowledge of her rights or of the condition of the estate. McLean v. McLean, 51 Ga. App. 751, 181 S.E. 707 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Cost of administration constitutes debt.</b> - Commissions due the administrator, or personal representative of an estate, are considered as part of the costs, and fall under the head of "necessary expenses of administration." It necessarily follows that the commissions earned by the administrator have priority over the claim of the heir to heir's distributive share, and every part thereof, in the estate. Lester v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Year's support set apart to a widow and minor children takes precedence,</b> not only over debts due by the decedent, but even of taxes which are due the state; and this is based upon a sound public policy looking to the protection of widows and children out of the estate of a decedent for the space of 12 months, and until such time as they may provide support for the future. Tomlinson v. City of Adel, 169 Ga. 758, 151 S.E. 482 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a return of appraisers setting apart a year's support to a widow was made on May 10, 1932, but when, as the result of objections filed, the return was not admitted to record or made the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) until November 5, 1934, and in the meantime the widow was deprived of the use and enjoyment of the property, being supported by a son, the property as finally set apart was not liable for taxes accruing against the estate during the years 1933 and 1934. Olmstead v. Clark, 181 Ga. 478, 182 S.E. 513 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Whether, as against one indebted on a chose in action set apart as a year's support, and whether even for some other purposes the title to the property set apart may be considered as vested in the beneficiary from the time the return of the appraisers is filed with the court of ordinary (now probate court), yet when the claim is suspended by the filing of objections, with the result that the possession and use of the year's support are deferred pending trial, the property, after final judgment disallowing the objections and admitting the return to record, is not liable for taxes accruing against the estate of the decedent in the meantime. Olmstead v. Clark, 181 Ga. 478, 182 S.E. 513 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Year's support inferior to subsequently accrued taxes.</b> - Property set aside for a year's support to the widow and minor children is not exempt from taxes including taxation by a municipality, accruing against the property after it has been so set aside for a year's support. City of Waycross v. Cottingham, 60 Ga. App. 463, 4 S.E.2d 67 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Pavement assessment lien.</b> - When the decedent husband, under a foreclosure of his security deed, acquired title to the property subsequently set apart to his widow as a year's support, after the lien of a paving assessment had attached thereto, her title was subordinate to such lien of the city, and the court did not err in so holding. Paulk v. City of Ocilla, 188 Ga. 69, 2 S.E.2d 642 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1508).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Penalty for delay in presentation of claims</b> against an estate is loss of priority not loss of any part of the debt, principal, or interest. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams Hosp. v. Nisbet, 191 Ga. 821, 14 S.E.2d 64 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Publication of notice of limitation of time to file claims.</b> - In general, when an order is given for the publication of a notice of a limitation of the time to file claims, and such notice is duly published, claims not filed within the time specified in the notice are precluded in that proceeding from sharing in the assets. This result is held to follow, however, only when there has been, in the meantime, a final distribution of the funds in the hands of the receiver, based upon claims proven, unless injustice would otherwise be done. Gainesville Nat'l Bank ex rel. Com. Union Assurance Co. v. Martin, 187 Ga. 559, 1 S.E.2d 636 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Liability of Administrator</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suit on bond of administrator.</b> - When bond has been given by an administrator in the usual course of administration proceedings, as required by statute, the ordinary remedy of a creditor of the estate, after failure by the administrator to pay the obligation in due course, and after compliance by the creditor with preliminary statutory procedure, is a suit upon the bond. Such a suit against the administrator and the securities on the bond usually affording an adequate remedy at law, it is generally unnecessary to resort to equity for the collection or protection of the claim. Butler v. Floyd, 184 Ga. 447, 191 S.E. 460 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff would not be relieved from liability,</b> although plaintiff may have given notice to creditors in pursuance of law and the present claim for taxes was not asserted, or brought to the attention of the plaintiff by any taxing official until after distribution, if the plaintiff, as administrator, had knowledge of such tax liability, and the plaintiff distributed the estate at the plaintiff's peril; and it is immaterial that the claim for taxes was not asserted within the time fixed by law after notice by the administrator to creditors, or before such distribution. Hardin v. Reynolds, 189 Ga. 534, 6 S.E.2d 328 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1505).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Tort claim as debt.</b> - Tort claim against executor for death caused by decedent's negligent operation of an automobile was a "debt" within the meaning of this statute. Jones v.

<p class="p4">Because a claim for unliquidated damages in a tort action is a debt within the meaning of this statute, a defendant in a tort action cannot bring in the administrator of an estate as an involuntary plaintiff for the purposes of asserting a counterclaim before the expiration of the waiting period.

<p class="p4"><b>Discharge of administrator within six month exemption period violates public policy.</b> - Discharge by the court of ordinary (now probate court) of the administrators within the 12- (now six) month exemption period would have the effect of permanently barring the right of action of the plaintiff tort claimants against the administrators for damages for injuries allegedly caused by the decedent's negligence - a result clearly against public policy, and would constitute an irregularity sufficient to demand the re-opening of the estate, even if the discharge was obtained in accordance with all the requirements of law as to notice, hearing, etc., a showing of fraud not being essential.

English v. Shivers, 220 Ga. 737, 141 S.E.2d 443 (1965) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a legal representative suffers a judgment to be rendered against the representative during the six month period, a claimant of property against which such judgment is sought to be enforced cannot bring into question the validity thereof, since its rendition within that period can in no way have operated to the representative's prejudice. Cannon v. Tant, 229 Ga. 771, 195 S.E.2d 15 (1972) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statutory provision that no suit to recover a debt due by a decedent shall be commenced against one's legal representative until the expiration of 12 (now six) months from one's qualification is for the security of such representative, to protect the representative from suit until the representative can ascertain the condition of the estate. Cannon v. Tant, 229 Ga. 771, 195 S.E.2d 15 (1972) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumed knowledge of executors.</b> - Executors are presumed to have knowledge of the condition of the estate; it is the executors' duty to have such knowledge; it was no defense to the year's support proceeding that claims against the estate inferior in rank to a year's support had been paid. McLean v. McLean, 51 Ga. App. 751, 181 S.E. 707 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1507).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Applicability</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When amount sought to be recovered not alleged.</b> - When a plaintiff not only seeks to recover certain personalty as belonging to her and of which the deceased had possession when she died, but seeks in the trover action to recover a money judgment against the defendant, as administrator, for hire for the use of the personal property sought, the provisions of this statute become applicable, and when such a proceeding was brought within seven days after the appointment and qualification of the defendant as permanent administrator of the estate of the deceased, the trial court properly dismissed the proceeding. Byrd v. Riggs, 87 Ga. App. 7, 73 S.E.2d 35 (1952) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute has been held applicable in situations where the amount sought to be recovered was not alleged and was dependent upon an accounting prayed for. This exemption is not made inapplicable when the petition sought injunctive relief in addition to a monetary judgment. Fuller v. Fuller, 217 Ga. 691, 124 S.E.2d 741 (1962) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale at expiration of administration year.</b> - It is not an absolute requirement of law that an administrator sell all land of an estate at expiration of administration year and that the land shall be sold only for the payment of debts or distribution. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1507). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An administrator is not under any duty immediately to sell real property of the intestate after the expiration of the administration year; but, before the real property can be sold, it must distinctly be shown to the ordinary (now probate judge) that it is necessary to sell the land to satisfy one of the conditions referred to by statute. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1507). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Allegation that the real property was not sold promptly or at the expiration of the administration year did not show a breach of the bond of the administrators as there is no requirement of the law that an administrator shall sell the real estate promptly after qualification, nor does the law require that an administrator sell the real property at the expiration of the year. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1507).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>3. Limitations</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rule generally adopted by courts in construing statutes</b> which give such an exemption from suit is that, when the suit does not seek to fix or establish a liability against the estate, the suit does not come within the statute. Chapman v. Hamilton Nat'l Bank, 51 Ga. App. 74, 179 S.E. 650 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute is inapplicable in a suit to recover on a debt against an administrator</b> in a representative capacity, and establish and fasten such liability against the estate. Butler v. Floyd, 184 Ga. 447, 191 S.E. 460 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute only comprehends suits to recover debts due by the decedent.</b> It does not prevent a party from seeking an injunction against the administrator within the six months; nor to a suit seeking cancellation of a deed to an intestate. Terry v. Fickett, 199 Ga. 30, 33 S.E.2d 163 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Code section inapplicable to continuations of actions.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-102 applies only to the commencement of actions against an executor within six months of the executor's qualification, not to continuations of actions pending at the time of the decedent's death. Turtle Creek Nat'l Bank v. Gretz, 690 F. Supp. 1020 (N.D. Ga. 1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action of trover.</b> - Exemption does not apply to a suit which only asks that a judgment be obtained for the purpose of subjecting the property, the title to which is already in the plaintiff, to a sale under an execution for the purpose of paying the amount of the plaintiff's claim. Chapman v. Hamilton Nat'l Bank, 51 Ga. App. 74, 179 S.E. 650 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The exemption as to administrators from suit for a period of 12 (now six) months subsequent to their qualification does not apply to suits for injunction and garnishment proceedings, nor to a suit to cancel a deed, it not being a suit to recover a debt, nor does it apply to a suit on a contract for specific performance; nor does it apply to a suit in trover for an article when damages are waived; nor does it apply in case of the exercise of the power of sale given in a security deed, such a proceeding being no suit at all. Chapman v. Hamilton Nat'l Bank, 51 Ga. App. 74, 179 S.E. 650 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute precluding suits against administrators to recover on debts due by decedents until the expiration of 12 (now six) months from the qualification of such representatives, unless this provision is expressly or impliedly waived by the representative, has no application to a suit for injunction. Butler v. Floyd, 184 Ga. 447, 191 S.E. 460 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An action in trover against an administrator, wherein a recovery for the hire and value of the property involved is expressly waived, and recovery of the property itself is sought, is not covered by this statute, providing that no suit to recover a debt due by the decedent shall be commenced against the administrator until the expiration of 12 (now six) months from the administrator's qualification. Atkinson v. Universal Credit Co., 51 Ga. App. 517, 180 S.E. 926 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute providing no suit to recover a debt due by the decedent shall be commenced against the administrator until the expiration of six months from the administrator's qualification does not apply to trover action wherein recovery for hire and value of property involved is expressly waived, and recovery of property itself is sought within the six months period. Commercial Bank v. Pharr, 75 Ga. App. 364, 43 S.E.2d 439 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plaintiff, in a proper case, may institute an action of trover against an administrator, if the administrator wrongfully withholds property belonging to the plaintiff, before the expiration of 12 (now six) months.

<p class="p4">While under this statute no suit to recover a debt due by the decedent shall be commenced against the administrator until the expiration of 12 (now six) months from the administrator's qualification, a suit brought against an administrator for the purpose of canceling deeds made to the intestate is not a suit to recover a debt due by the decedent, and may be brought before the expiration of 12 (now six) months from the qualification of the administrator. Sutton v. McMillan, 213 Ga. 90, 97 S.E.2d 139 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1526).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>An assent once given to a devise is irrevocable</b> as a general rule, and perfects the inchoate title to the property in the devisee, even if the assets of the estate may prove insufficient to pay the debts; in which case the remedy of an unpaid creditor is, generally, not to have the devised land subjected to a sale under an order of the ordinary (now probate judge), or under a judgment against the executor, but to follow the property into the hands of the devisee and there subject it at law or equity to the payment of the devisee's claim. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1506).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>An exception to the general rule</b> that assent to a devise is irrevocable even if the assets of the estate prove insufficient to pay debts is that an executor is precluded from administering to oneself as against the rights of creditors of whose claims the administrator has notice. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1506). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plaintiff, claiming as a devisee under the will of plaintiff's father, was estopped from asserting that the executor of the will had assented to the devise, and from denying that title to the property devised was in subsequently appointed administrators de bonis non cum testamento annexo at the time of their public sale of the realty of the estate, under which the defendant claimed, the basis of such alleged estoppel being that the plaintiff joined in a written request by all four devisees to the ordinary (now probate judge) for the appointment of such administrators, upon their petition setting forth that the will remained unexecuted.

<p class="p4"><b>Right of heir to expenses.</b> - An heir who has done the exact thing provided for by statute, except that the heir has been unable to obtain the consent or assignment of the administrator (which, under Supreme Court decisions, does not preclude the heir's action) may also realize expenses out of the fund brought in, the ordinary (now probate judge) having awarded the expenses in the exercise of the court's general jurisdiction over the disposition and distribution of the property of the estate.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claim for a year's support</b> is a claim against the estate; thus, the executor had authority under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-45 to settle the claim. Davis v. Hawkins, 238 Ga. App. 749, 521 S.E.2d 10 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signing of estate tax return did not abandon claim.</b> - Trial court's denial of a sister's motion to dismiss an action by siblings, seeking to set aside quitclaim deeds that the parties' father had executed in favor of the sister, was proper because the siblings, as heirs at law and beneficiaries of the estate, were proper parties to have brought the action pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-7-2 and 53-7-5(a) when it was clear that the co-executors, one of whom was the sister, were not going to bring the claim; there was no abandonment of the claim against the property despite the signing by the co-executors of a federal estate tax return under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-45, as the tax return was due and any changes based on rights to the property could have been set forth in an amended return. Field v. Mednikow, 279 Ga. App. 380, 631 S.E.2d 395 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Perpetuation of indulgence as exercised by testator prohibited.</b> - Administrator de bonis non would be liable for failure to collect a debt due the estate, which became uncollectible by reason of indulgence to the debtor by the administrator, even though the will provided that "the handling of my property and the operation of the business to be done by and through my executors hereinafter named just in the manner as near as practical as I have handled and operated my business during my life," and it was shown that the testator in the testator's lifetime had indulged the debtor for a long time. Musselwhite v. Ricks, 55 Ga. App. 58, 189 S.E. 597 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1510).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retirement funds.</b> - There was evidence and legal authority to support the probate court's ruling that retirement funds belonged to the decedent's son because the son was named as beneficiary, and the funds did not pass into the decedent's estate because the executor testified that the executor concluded that the retirement funds were not an estate asset so the executor did not attempt to collect the funds from the son; resolution of the issue of the retirement proceeds in the context of a petition for settlement of accounts under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-63 fell within the probate court's jurisdiction, and the probate court did not err in failing to transfer the claim to the superior court under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-75 because the claim involved a conflict between the will and a designation of beneficiary, and not the construction of the will itself. In re Estate of Long, 307 Ga. App. 896, 706 S.E.2d 704 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claim not in estate's best interest.</b> - There was evidence to support a probate court's finding that it was not in the estate's best interest to pursue a claim regarding a death-bed gift because the probate court's ruling that assignment of the claim passed to the residual beneficiaries under the decedent's will, and pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-45, the prosecution of the claim would be at the beneficiary's expense, comported with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-45, and the probate court had the authority to enter the finding; the ruling assigned the claim to the beneficiaries, including the decedent's daughter, who could pursue the claim at her own expense.

<p class="p4"><b>Authority to settle claims.</b> - Decedent's wife, as the surviving spouse, was the proper party to seek damages for the decedent's wrongful death, and, as the administrator of the decedent's estate, damages for the decedent's shock, fright and terror prior to the collision, all components of the mental pain and suffering endured by the decedent upon impact up until the decedent's death, and funeral and burial expenses, and the wife had the authority to settle or compromise the claims without any input from the decedent's children.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A personal representative who has fully performed all duties or who has been allowed to resign may petition the probate court for discharge from the office and from all liability. The petition shall state that the personal representative has fully administered the estate of the decedent and shall set forth the names and addresses of all known heirs of an intestate decedent or beneficiaries of a testate decedent, including any persons who succeeded to the interest of any heir or beneficiary who died after the decedent died, and shall name which of the heirs or beneficiaries is or should be represented by a guardian. The petition shall state that the personal representative has paid all claims against the estate or shall enumerate which claims of the estate have not been paid and the reason for such nonpayment. The petition shall also state that the personal representative has filed all necessary inventory and returns or, alternatively, has been relieved of such filings by the testator, the heirs or beneficiaries, or the probate court. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, upon the filing of a petition for discharge, citation shall issue to all heirs or beneficiaries, as provided in Chapter 11 of this title, requiring them to file any objections to the discharge, except that in all cases a citation shall be published one time in the newspaper in which sheriff's advertisements are published in the county in which the petition is filed at least ten days prior to the date on or before which any objection is required to be filed. Any creditors whose claims are disputed or who have not been paid in full due to insolvency of the estate shall be served in accordance with Chapter 11 of this title. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, it shall not be necessary to notify any heir or beneficiary who has relieved the personal representative of all liability or any heir or beneficiary with respect to whom the personal representative has been relieved of all further liability in a binding proceeding such as a settlement of accounts pursuant to Code Sections 53-7-60 through 53-7-63 or an intermediate report pursuant to Code Sections 53-7-73 through 53-7-76. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If any party in interest files objection to the discharge, a hearing shall be held. If as a result of the hearing, the probate court is satisfied that the personal representative has faithfully and honestly discharged the office, an order shall be entered releasing and discharging the personal representative from all liability. If no objections are filed, the probate court shall enter the order for discharge without further proceedings or delay. Any heir or beneficiary or creditor who is a minor at the time of the discharge and who is not represented by a guardian may, within two years of reaching the age of majority, commence suit against the personal representative and such discharge shall be no bar to the action. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative discharged, the probate court, upon petition of any interested person and upon such notice as it directs, may appoint the same personal representative or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently discovered estate. If a new appointment is made, unless the probate court orders otherwise, the provisions of this title shall apply as appropriate; but no claim previously barred may be asserted in the subsequent administration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment of discharge may be set aside for fraud.</b> - While the statute seemingly refers to a motion in the court of ordinary (now probate court) which granted the discharge, the action can be sustained under the general rule that a judgment may be set aside for fraud in a court of equity; a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) being no exception to this rule. White v. Roper, 176 Ga. 180, 167 S.E. 177 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4091).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provisions of this statute do not alter the cardinal rule</b> that a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, and regular upon the judgment's face, is to be deemed conclusive until the judgment is duly set aside, either on motion in the court in which the judgment was rendered, or in an equitable proceeding instituted in the superior court. Stanton v. Gailey, 72 Ga. App. 292, 33 S.E.2d 747 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2303). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging the administrator is open to attack on the ground that the judgment was fraudulently procured, the judgment is to be deemed "void" only when, in a proceeding to set it aside, the proof shows the judgment was secured by practicing a fraud upon the heirs at law or upon the ordinary. Stanton v. Gailey, 72 Ga. App. 292, 33 S.E.2d 747 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2303).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Procedure to Set Aside Discharge Judgment</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Procedure to set aside fraudulently obtained discharge.</b> - Judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging an administrator, which has been fraudulently obtained by falsely representing to the ordinary (now probate judge) that the applicant has fully discharged the applicant's duties as administrator, can be set aside by a proper proceeding for that purpose, instituted in the court rendering it; and this remedy is open to creditors as well as to heirs. Mullis v. Bank of Chauncey, 40 Ga. App. 582, 150 S.E. 471 (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4091). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Though the discharge of an executor obtained by actual fraud practiced on the heirs or the ordinary (now probate judge) may be set aside on motion and proof of the fraud, the beneficiaries sui juris under the will must institute their action to set aside the discharge within three years from the date of the order discharging the executor. Warnock v. Warnock, 206 Ga. 548, 57 S.E.2d 571 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2303). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Petition seeking to set aside a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging an executor, brought 13 years after such discharge, which did not contain specific allegations of actual fraud on the part of the executor deterring and debarring the plaintiffs from sooner instituting the action so as to toll the statute of limitations, was subject to dismissal on general demurrer.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach of fiduciary duty shown.</b> - Probate court properly revoked letters testamentary, ordered reimbursement to a decedent's estate of excessive expenses, and ordered a settling of the estate's accounts when the decedent's executor committed 17 breaches of fiduciary duty, including failing to wind up the estate and failing to provide the decedent's other child with an accounting. Fowler v. Cox, 264 Ga. App. 880, 592 S.E.2d 510 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a probate court's order removing an executor; the relevant question in reviewing a removal order regarding an executor is whether the trial court had grounds to conclude that there was good cause for the removal. In re Estate of Arnsdorff, 273 Ga. App. 612, 615 S.E.2d 758 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court order removing an executor from an estate and ordering the attorney to forfeit $79,000 in commissions and fees received and costs incurred as executor and attorney for the estate was upheld on appeal because: (1) the record showed that the attorney filed a purported estate accounting six inches thick, which was prepared by the staff and which the attorney showed little familiarity with; (2) the attorney delayed a distribution to a beneficiary by trying to force the beneficiary to create a trust, which was not required by the decedent's will; (3) the attorney filed an erroneous tax return that had to be amended as well as took a deduction the attorney knew was improper; and (4) the attorney incurred unnecessary expenses and fees by showing the decedent's house when the sale of the house was not required by the will. In re Estate of Arnsdorff, 273 Ga. App. 612, 615 S.E.2d 758 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because an executor ignored a testator's intent and the directions contained in the testator's will, and consciously failed to seek direction from the courts despite the executor's admitted knowledge that the executor should do so, the trial court properly found that the executor violated the executor's fiduciary duties and forfeited the executor's right to compensation in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-54(a)(7). Cronic v. Baker, 284 Ga. 452, 667 S.E.2d 363 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Personal representative's wrongful conveyance of the estate's primary asset, a house, to the personal representative was a breach of fiduciary duty. The beneficiary's evidence of the house's rental value authorized the award to the beneficiary of compensatory damages for lost rent under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-7-54 and 53-12-193.

Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. II, Para. III, venue for such actions was in the county where a defendant resided. Thus, if a contempt petition was filed pursuant to the statute, the motion to transfer venue filed by two lawyers and their law firm should have been granted as neither lawyer resided in the forum county and their law firm was not located in that county.

<p class="p4"><b>An administrator cannot be allowed to violate the public law</b> of the state in the management of the estate entrusted to the administrator, and then be heard to say that such violation of the law was for the benefit of that estate, when called on to show cause why the administrator's letters of administration should not be revoked.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mismanagement Generally</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An allegation of insolvency of the executor</b> is a substantial factor for consideration when there are specific allegations showing danger of loss to persons interested in the estate, but an allegation of insolvency, standing alone, is insufficient to authorize a court of equity to interfere in the administration of an estate. The ordinary (now probate judge) has ample authority to investigate charges that an executor is mismanaging an estate, and to require the executor to give bond or to remove the person as executor. Gaines v. Johnson, 216 Ga. 668, 119 S.E.2d 28 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>While failure to make returns as required by law</b> may be cause for removing an executor, it is not a compulsory ground for so doing, but one within the discretion of the court. Holsenbeck v. Arnold, 75 Ga. App. 311, 43 S.E.2d 348 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Failure of an executor or guardian to make returns is an omission of duty, and therefore a breach of trust, and throws on the executor or guardian the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the court and jury that the executor or guardian has discharged the duty of the trust with fidelity. Holsenbeck v. Arnold, 75 Ga. App. 311, 43 S.E.2d 348 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In a proceeding by a legatee against an executor for an accounting,</b> before the ordinary (now probate judge) under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2201, the ordinary (or the superior court on appeal) is authorized to remove such executor when it appears that the executor has without authority used property in the executor's hands, in a joint venture or partnership in which the executor in the executor's individual right is interested, and when, without authority, the executor is shown to have held as speculation property or crops which it was the executor's duty under the law to sell. This is true, even though such venture or speculation does not result in loss to the beneficiary, the law being that as to such a trust this relationship must not be assumed and no such risk be taken, unless authorized by the will. Perdue v. McKenzie, 194 Ga. 356, 21 S.E.2d 705 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Executor's breach of fiduciary duty.</b> - Probate court order removing an executor for cause was affirmed because the executor violated the executor's fiduciary duty in numerous ways by failing to dissolve the estate business, using estate property and funds for the executor's own benefit and to pay personal bills, overpaying executor's fees, and having a conflict of interest by continuing to operate the business despite the estate losing money but personally benefiting by using the business property rent free. Myers v. Myers, 297 Ga. 490, 775 S.E.2d 145 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Removal not required.</b> - Statute does not require an ordinary (now probate judge), or a jury in the judge's stead to remove the administrator when, though admittedly there were certain violations of the law, no loss is claimed to have resulted to the estate, and when no accounting is sought. Lokey v. Lokey, 82 Ga. App. 171, 60 S.E.2d 569 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remedies</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suit on bond of administrator as remedy for fraud.</b> - When the heirs allege that the administrator of the estate is guilty of fraud and collusion with respect to the sale of property, and that a receiver should be appointed to reclaim and resell the property, but the heirs do not want to prevent the ultimate sale of the property, the question is merely one of damage resulting from an alleged breach of duty by the administrator. In this case, the administrator's bond as administrator would furnish an adequate remedy to the heirs, since they could not possibly be in such danger of loss or injury as to require either a receivership or an injunction for the protection of their interests. Conner v. Yawn, 200 Ga. 500, 37 S.E.2d 541 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, in a suit against an administrator and another for the appointment of a receiver and other equitable relief, it appears from the pleadings and evidence that the heirs of an estate may obtain adequate protection and redress in the court of ordinary (now probate court) as to each complaint against an administrator in reference to the estate of the intestate, the heirs do not present a proper case for the appointment of a receiver for such estate or for injunction since a suit on the administrator's bond is an adequate remedy at law. Conner v. Yawn, 200 Ga. 500, 37 S.E.2d 541 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If a bond is not sufficient to protect any interested party,</b> the ordinary (now probate judge) has authority, upon proper application, to increase the bond, revoke the letters of administration, or pass such other order as may in the party's judgment be expedient under the circumstances of the case. Furr v. Jordan, 196 Ga. 862, 27 S.E.2d 861 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of widow upon removal of administrator.</b> - While, as provided in law after the administrator has been appointed and has taken charge of the estate, upon proof that the administrator wastes or in any manner mismanages the estate or for any reason the administrator is unfit for the trust reposed in the administrator, the ordinary (now probate judge) may in the ordinary's discretion revoke the letters of administration. The widow, who is legally entitled to the administration, cannot, when she is of sound mind, be denied the appointment upon the mere speculation that she will, on account of lack of business experience and want of capacity to manage the particular estate, mismanage the estate and prove unfit for the trust reposed. Sampson v. Sampson, 44 Ga. App. 803, 163 S.E. 326 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Removal of executor proper.</b> - When an executor destroys or attempts to destroy evidence in the executor's possession that would help prove an arguably valid claim against the estate, the probate court does not abuse the court's discretion in removing the executor, particularly when, as here, the executor is the residual beneficiary under the will and thus stands to personally profit from defeat of the claim. In re Estate of Davis, 243 Ga. App. 58, 532 S.E.2d 169 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court properly revoked letters testamentary, ordered reimbursement to a decedent's estate of excessive expenses, and ordered a settling of the estate's accounts when the decedent's executor committed 17 breaches of fiduciary duty, including failing to wind up the estate and failing to provide the decedent's other child with an accounting. Fowler v. Cox, 264 Ga. App. 880, 592 S.E.2d 510 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-55(1) in removing the executor as executor of the decedent's estate as the executor did not carry out the duties under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-1(a); the executor did not take control of the assets of the estate, the executor commingled estate funds with the executor's own funds, and the executor sold the decedent's house without obtaining an appraisal or attempting to realize the best price on the open market. In re Estate of Zeigler, 273 Ga. App. 269, 614 S.E.2d 799 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As the question of the legitimacy of the administrator's transactions was properly before the court, the probate court did not err in addressing it or in granting the relief necessary to protect the estate. Ray v. Nat'l Health Investors, Inc., 280 Ga. App. 44, 633 S.E.2d 388 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Removal of executor not proper.</b> - Trial court erred in removing an executor of an estate based on the executor's failure to appear at a hearing concerning a will beneficiary's request for information; there was no evidence that the executor was on notice that executor's letters testamentary could be revoked for failing to attend the hearing as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-55. In re Estate of Zeigler, 259 Ga. App. 807, 578 S.E.2d 519 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to remove proper.</b> - Probate court properly denied a petition to remove an executor. The assertion rested upon an assertion that a will was void, which had been rejected, and upon an assertion that the estate should be distributed according to an alleged contract between the parties, which the probate court held that the court did not have jurisdiction to consider. In re Estate of Brice, 288 Ga. App. 449, 654 S.E.2d 420 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discretionary Power of Probate Court or Jury</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Broad discretion.</b> - Under this statute, the discretion of the ordinary (now probate judge), or a jury acting in the ordinary's stead on appeal to the superior court, is very broad and may be exercised whether the violation of law under consideration is a minor or major "matter," and the court may not in either event withdraw that discretion. Lokey v. Lokey, 82 Ga. App. 171, 60 S.E.2d 569 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court may not lawfully tell a jury that they have no right to remove an administrator who is guilty of mismanagement which does not result in any injury to the estate. To do so would be to invade the province of the jury by withdrawing the jury's discretion. Lokey v. Lokey, 82 Ga. App. 171, 60 S.E.2d 569 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because removal of an executor was within the jury's discretion but was not mandated, the trial court properly denied the petitioner's motions for directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. following a special verdict finding that the executor should not be removed. Crump v. McDonald, 239 Ga. App. 647, 520 S.E.2d 283 (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-148).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute furnishes the necessary guidance</b> for the exercise of the ordinary's (now probate judge) or jury's discretion as to remedial measures to be adopted against a negligent or derelict administrator upon consideration of the evidence upon the hearing. An ordinary (now probate judge) or a jury in the ordinary's stead has broad discretion in the premises, and the law does not require an administrator's removal, even if guilty of mismanagement or misconduct, as the only remedial measure. The jury may in the jury's discretion do something else. Lokey v. Lokey, 82 Ga. App. 171, 60 S.E.2d 569 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Revoking letters of administration</b> is an action that a jury may take or not take in the jury's discretion, and this discretion will not be controlled unless abused. Lokey v. Lokey, 82 Ga. App. 171, 60 S.E.2d 569 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an administrator has been guilty of a violation of the law in the management of an estate, but the administrator's act has not resulted in any loss to the estate, the jury could still remove the administrator. Lokey v. Lokey, 82 Ga. App. 171, 60 S.E.2d 569 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even if the jury found some derelictions of the administrator to be "minor matters" the jury might regard them as presaging more serious infractions, and having found such violations of the law might, in their discretion, remove the administrator. Lokey v. Lokey, 82 Ga. App. 171, 60 S.E.2d 569 (1950) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the findings and conclusions of the probate court established that a former spouse's marital status was not correctly stated in the former spouse's application for letters of administration, and that this incorrect information was a material factor in the issuance of those letters, it was not an abuse of discretion to remove the spouse as administrator of the deceased's estate. In re Estate of Dunn, 236 Ga. App. 211, 511 S.E.2d 575 (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-148).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority to remedy executor's misconduct.</b> - Trial court did not err in dismissing purported beneficiary's complaint alleging that executors breached the fiduciary duties owed to the beneficiary<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by wasting the assets of the parents' estates and failing to distribute assets to the beneficiary because the claims would be more properly heard by the probate court which had original and exclusive jurisdiction over such matters; the probate court was equipped to handle such claims and had the authority to grant the relief requested, if necessary. Benefield v. Martin, 276 Ga. App. 130, 622 S.E.2d 469 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Removal of executor proper.</b> - When decedent's 89-year-old parent did not comprehend the duties and responsibilities of an executor and may have been acting in a manner detrimental to the estate, the probate court acted within the court's discretion in removing the parent as coexecutor. Nesmith v. Pierce, 226 Ga. App. 851, 487 S.E.2d 687 (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-148). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court did not abuse the court's discretion by removing all four siblings as co-executors because there was eminent distrust on all sides and the situation was untenable, thus, good cause existed for the removal order.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer of discretion.</b> - On appeal to the superior court after a finding adverse to the petitioner on the issue of the administrator's unfitness by the ordinary (now probate judge), the trial in the superior court is had without reference to the evidence introduced in the former trial, and in such a case the discretion exercised by the ordinary (now probate judge) is transferred to the jury in the superior court. Wofford v. Vandiver, 72 Ga. App. 623, 34 S.E.2d 579 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1101 made the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229 applicable to executors, and by the provisions of <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229, an executor may be removed or required to give additional security - in the exercise of sound discretion by the ordinary (now probate judge) - when it is shown that the ordinary is guilty of waste or mismanagement or that the ordinary is insolvent or, for any reason, the ordinary is unfit for the trust, yet despite this power courts are reluctant to exercise the power when no strong case therefor is shown. And the discretion vested by the statute in the ordinary (now probate judge) is to be exercised by the jury or judge acting as jury on appeal to the superior court. Patterson v. Patterson, 208 Ga. 17, 64 S.E.2d 585 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Revocation powers of probate court.</b> - For a failure to make "returns as required by law," or for insufficient security, the administrator may be cited in the court of ordinary (now probate court) and the court of ordinary (now probate judge) is vested with full power to revoke the letters of administration, or to pass such order as may be necessary for the protection of interested parties. Hoffman v. Chester, 204 Ga. 296, 49 S.E.2d 760 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1229). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A proceeding for the revocation of letters of administration or letters testamentary may be initiated "whenever the ordinary (now probate judge) knows, or is informed by any person having any interest in the estate," that one or more of the specified conditions exist which will authorize the ordinary (now probate judge) in the ordinary's discretion to revoke the letters; an attorney may convey such information to the ordinary and initiate by a petition the proceeding, resulting in an order of revocation of the letters testamentary by the ordinary (now probate judge), and in an affirmance of such order by the superior court on appeal, even though the attorney may not be a beneficiary under the will or a creditor of the estate, but is merely interested therein on account of a claim for attorney's fees in connection with the probate of the will.

<p class="p4"><b>Breach of settlement agreement by executor.</b> - It is necessary for the probate court to address any material unresolved factual issues including the question of whether an executor has breached a settlement agreement; since the beneficiary under the will is not seeking to enforce the agreement, but instead to determine whether the executor has breached the agreement, the superior court should not have jurisdiction. Gray v. McKenna, 202 Ga. App. 685, 415 S.E.2d 295 (1992) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-148).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of the court of ordinary (now probate court) to revoke the letters of executorship,</b> and to require the executor to make an accounting and settlement to the heirs, is limited to the case as one at law.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute does not appear to be of legislative origin,</b> but seems to have been placed in the Code by the first codifiers, and retained in each subsequent Code. It was not meant to announce any new principle; for the English courts of equity had long exercised such a jurisdiction, and the American courts, with certain limitations and restrictions, have generally recognized the same rule. Jones v. Head, 185 Ga. 857, 196 S.E. 725 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 37-403 (see O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 23-2-91) must be construed with former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 113-2203,</b> which declared that a court of equity shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) over the settlement of accounts of administrators. Manry v. Manry, 196 Ga. 365, 26 S.E.2d 706 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Performance of supervisory office.</b> - Neither former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203 nor former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 37-403 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-91) intended to confer upon a court of equity the performance of a supervisory office and the duty of overseeing the conduct of the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the administration of estates. Arnold v. Harris, 179 Ga. 896, 177 S.E. 738 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extent of jurisdiction.</b> - A court of equity is distinctly and in terms declared to have jurisdiction over the settlement of accounts of administrators, and a court of equity having jurisdiction for that purpose may go on and give full relief in the premises. Calbeck v. Herrington, 169 Ga. 869, 152 S.E. 53 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4075); Morris v.

<p class="p4">It by no means follows that because a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) over the settlement of accounts of administrators, it will act in every case involving that subject matter. Jones v. Head, 185 Ga. 857, 196 S.E. 725 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Courts of equity and courts of ordinary (now probate courts) have concurrent jurisdiction over the matter of accounting as against an administrator or executor, and a suit in equity for accounting may be filed, notwithstanding the fact that the court of ordinary (now probate court) may require an accounting, so long as no actual proceedings for an accounting have been instituted in the court of ordinary (now probate court). Morris v. Nicholson, 198 Ga. 450, 31 S.E.2d 786 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203); Spence v.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to executors.</b> - Principle that a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction over the settlement of accounts of administrators is made applicable to executors. Powell v. Smith, 178 Ga. 737, 174 S.E. 341 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>An executor is entitled to the direction of the courts</b> of Georgia and to the aid of equity in the settlement of the executor's accounts in the performance of the executor's duties and the fulfillment of the executor's oath if a proper case for equity is alleged. Georgia Money Corp. v. Rissman, 220 Ga. 476, 139 S.E.2d 486 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a legatee under a will brings an equitable proceeding to compel an executor to settle with the executor and to turn over to the legacies or devises coming to the executor under the will, a court of equity has jurisdiction to require the executor to give bond in a proper case. Powell v. Smith, 178 Ga. 737, 174 S.E. 341 (1934) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proceeding brought for accounting with an administrator</b> is not predicated upon any debt or claim against the administrator or the estate; the heirs at law are not creditors of either, but the owners of the property of the deceased, subject to the rules of administration of estates. Rowland v. Rowland, 204 Ga. 603, 50 S.E.2d 343 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application may be made to a court of equity</b> by a party interested in the estate, before application for the appointment of an administrator, or the filing of a will and a petition that it be probated. But the concurrent jurisdiction of equity is not confined to this. Howard v. Boone, 170 Ga. 156, 152 S.E. 462 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4075).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Courts of equity are loath to interfere</b> in the administration of estates; but having concurrent jurisdiction with the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the settlement of accounts, the court's will not hesitate to interfere for the full protection of the rights of parties in interest.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jurisdiction Generally</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdictional equality.</b> - Proceeding brought against an administrator or executor and for a settlement by an heir at law or legatee is not such interference with the regular administration of estates as is denounced by law. The jurisdiction of a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a court of equity in respect to bringing proceedings for an account and settlement is co-ordinate and equal, and has always been so in this state. The jurisdiction conferred upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the management and distribution of estates does not oust the jurisdiction of equity in matters of settlement. Terry v. Chandler, 172 Ga. 715, 158 S.E. 572 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4075); Manry v. Manry, 196 Ga. 365, 26 S.E.2d 706 (1943);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Court first taking jurisdiction will retain it.</b> - "A court of equity" having "concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) over the settlement of accounts of administrators" the court first taking jurisdiction will "retain it, unless a good reason shall be given for the interference of equity." "A proceeding in equity for such settlement is not an interference with the regular administration of the estate, within the meaning" of former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4596 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-91). Clements v. Fletcher, 154 Ga. 386, 114 S.E. 637 (1922) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4075); Terry v. Chandler, 172 Ga. 715, 158 S.E. 572 (1931); Robinson v.

<p class="p4">Even after administration has begun, and whenever it is made to appear that the conditions in the administration of the estate and the rights of all persons interested in the estate's administration can be more effectually preserved or promoted by the intervention of equity, the subject-matter of administration may be assumed by a court of equity. Howard v. Boone, 170 Ga. 156, 152 S.E. 462 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4075). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Though a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a court of equity are declared to have concurrent jurisdiction, it is a general rule that the court first taking will retain jurisdiction, unless the intervention of equity is necessary to afford relief in aid of the administration of the estate by the court of ordinary (now probate court); but the intervention of equity which seeks merely to oust the jurisdiction already acquired by the ordinary (now probate judge) cannot be used as a substitute for the appeal from the court of ordinary (now probate judge) to the superior court, which is provided by law, or to relieve from the results of failure to file proper caveats to an application for letters testamentary and the probate of a will in solemn form, unless it appears from the petition in equity that the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) was procured by fraud on the part of an adversary, unmixed with negligence upon the part of the petitioner. Darby v. Green, 174 Ga. 146, 162 S.E. 493 (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Superior Court's concurrent jurisdiction upheld.</b> - When the parties alleged that the parties were in danger of loss contrary to their interests, and sought to enforce specific performance of an agreement, to imply a trust, and to enjoin a party, the superior court properly exercised the court's concurrent jurisdiction. Lee v. Lee, 260 Ga. 356, 392 S.E.2d 870 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-160).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Concurrent jurisdiction.</b> - Trial court did not err in dismissing a purported beneficiary's complaint alleging that the executors breached the fiduciary duties owed to the beneficiary by wasting the assets of the parents' estates and failing to distribute assets to the beneficiary because the claims would be more properly heard by the probate court which had original and exclusive jurisdiction and was equipped to handle such claims and had the authority to grant the relief requested, if necessary. Benefield v. Martin, 276 Ga. App. 130, 622 S.E.2d 469 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts of equity have concurrent jurisdiction with courts of ordinary (now probate courts)</b> in the administration of the estates of deceased persons in all cases where equitable interference is necessary or proper for the full protection of the rights of the parties in interest. Jones v. Head, 185 Ga. 857, 196 S.E. 725 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Either a probate court or a court of equity</b> could take hold of any particular fund held by the representative of an estate, or anything which might be shown to be the proceeds of that fund actually in the representative's hands, and compel the representative to surrender possession thereof. Paschal v. Melton, 174 Ga. 910, 164 S.E. 757 (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of equity dependent upon adequacy of remedies available in probate court.</b> - Whatever may be the remedies that have been provided by statute against administrators, the concurrent jurisdiction of equity in the settlement of accounts of administrators is specially retained by the provisions of this statute. Howard v. Boone, 170 Ga. 156, 152 S.E. 462 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4075). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If an insolvent executor in charge of real estate which includes houses which need repairs, no matter however small, and the executor, being without sufficient funds to make them, fails to do so, and on this account the property is deteriorating, the persons to whom the property has been devised are entitled to have the property protected, and the appointment of a receiver with directions to the receiver to have the repairs made seems not to be an inappropriate remedy. Jones v. Proctor, 195 Ga. 607, 24 S.E.2d 779 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When devisee brings equitable petition against coexecutors of an estate, seeking a partition of the property of the estate through a sale by the receiver, and alleging that more than 20 years had elapsed since the executors had qualified, that all the debts of the estate had been paid, and that executors were in possession of all real and personal property belonging to the estate, the allegations are insufficient to authorize the grant of the prayers for equitable partition between the devisees because plaintiff devisee has a full and adequate remedy under the law in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to require executors to distribute the estate by division or partition. Salter v. Salter, 209 Ga. 511, 74 S.E.2d 241 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Though a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) over the settlement of accounts of executors, it will not assume jurisdiction solely for that purpose unless it be shown that the remedies available in the court of ordinary (now probate court) are inadequate to afford complete relief to the party claiming to be aggrieved. Salter v. Salter, 209 Ga. 511, 74 S.E.2d 241 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2203); Turner v. Turner, 210 Ga. 586, 82 S.E.2d 137 (1954); Gaines v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - Statute makes it the duty of a representative of a deceased executor to account fully with the administrator de bonis non. Estes v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 653, 157 S.E.2d 449 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Accounting required.</b> - Since an administrator de bonis non is necessarily a successor to an administrator or executor whose authority has expired by death, removal, or otherwise, this statute gives to the administrator de bonis non the right to an accounting only from executors and administrators who have been removed. Ballard v. Zachry, 54 Ga. App. 101, 187 S.E. 139 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2204). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An executor of a deceased executor's estate, which allegedly possesses assets of the estate of the decedent which were acquired by the deceased executor in the executor's capacity as executor of the decedent's estate, is an officer of the court of ordinary (now probate court) and subject to account to the administrator de bonis non with will annexed of the decedent's estate. Estes v. First Nat'l Bank, 223 Ga. 653, 157 S.E.2d 449 (1967) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of ordinary (now probate court) is without jurisdiction</b> to issue a citation upon the application of an administrator de bonis non requiring a former administrator of the estate who had been removed to render an accounting to the applicant; the jurisdiction of the court of ordinary (now probate court) in such cases applied only to the persons who are actually officers of the court at the time and does not apply to removed or discharged officers. Ellis v. McWilliams, 71 Ga. App. 336, 30 S.E.2d 796 (1944) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impact of death of executor.</b> - Representative of a deceased coexecutor, who was not the representative of the estate which the deceased coexecutor represented, is not, as to the estate represented by the administrator de bonis non, an officer of the court of ordinary (now probate court). Ballard v. Zachry, 54 Ga. App. 101, 187 S.E. 139 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Probate of the will worked a revocation</b> of the letters of administration as to assets unadministered. This is equivalent to a removal of the administrator. Hudmon v. Thomasson, 74 Ga. App. 31, 38 S.E.2d 683 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2204).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Administrator de bonis non of an estate</b> is ordinarily the person in whom is vested the right to sue a removed or deceased administrator of such estate for an alleged devastavit.

<p class="p4">When the pleadings showed that the administratrix de bonis non of an estate was also the administrator of the estate of the deceased administrator who was alleged to have committed the devastavit, and when the pleadings showed that the administrator had acted in both capacities since the year 1915, and that up to the filing of the plaintiff heirs' suit in 1930 the administrator made no returns nor brought any action for such alleged devastavit, it was not necessary for the plaintiff in this case to make the specific allegation that the administratrix de bonis non had failed to sue in order to bring suit in plaintiff's own right; and there was no duty resting on the heir to have an administratrix de bonis non appointed who was qualified.

<p class="p4"><b>Sounder and better construction of this statute,</b> touching the enforcement of judgments rendered by the ordinary (now probate judge) against executors and administrators on citations to account, is that mere money liabilities, when no specific fund is involved, are enforceable only by execution against the property, and not by attachment against the person.

<p class="p4"><b>Probate court's authority to order executor to turn over funds.</b> - In circumstances in which an estate executor used a power of attorney before the executor's mother's death to add the executor's name to bank accounts and a certificate of deposit, eventually taking all of the money from those accounts for the executor's own without reporting that money as part of the estate, a probate court was authorized to order the executor to turn over that money to the estate; after the executor was appointed to handle the estate, the executor knew that the executor possessed money that should have been in the estate, knowledge the executor gained by being the person who removed the money from the estate, and the executor's retention of those funds promoted the executor's own interest to injury of beneficiaries of the estate, and thus was a breach of the executor's fiduciary duty.

In such a case, there is no distinction between the ordinary (now probate judge) and the court of ordinary (now probate court). Trust Co. v. Smith, 54 Ga.

<p class="p4">When the administrator contended that it was not the administrator's duty to administer certain certificates of deposit for the reason that the decedent had given the certificates away during life, and therefore that the certificates were no part of the estate, whereas certain of the distributees contended to the contrary, it would be the duty of the court of ordinary (now probate court) to decide the question thus submitted, under authority of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2201 or former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2202.

<p class="p4">In a proceeding by a legatee against an executor, before the ordinary (now probate court) under this statute, for an accounting, the ordinary (or the superior court on appeal) is authorized to remove such executor when it appears that the executor has without authority used property in the executor's hands, in a joint venture or partnership in which the executor in one's individual right is interested, and where, without authority, the executor is shown to have held as a speculation property or crops which it was the executor's duty under the law to sell. This is true even though such venture or speculation does not result in loss to the beneficiary, the law being that as to such a trust this relationship must not be assumed and no such risk be taken, unless authorized by the will. Perdue v. McKenzie, 194 Ga. 356, 21 S.E.2d 705 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Equitable jurisdiction.</b> - While a court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary (now probate judge) in settlement of accounts of guardians (or administrators), the jurisdiction of the ordinary (now probate judge) is original and the court of equity concurrent. In settling accounts of the representative of an estate, the representative's returns which have been allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge) are considered as stated accounts, and the rule that any one who objects to a stated account must surcharge and falsify applies. The object of settling the accounts of the representative of an estate is to determine whether or not the representative has properly administered the trust. Trust Co. v. Smith, 54 Ga. App. 518, 188 S.E. 469 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Salter v. Salter, 209 Ga. 511, 74 S.E.2d 241 (1953) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2599, and former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2202, are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order removing administrator.</b> - Because an administrator was personally served with a copy of the removal petition and the "citation and rule nisi," and never raised any objection to the alleged procedural defect in the answer or during the hearing, the administrator's claim that the probate court erred in ordering an accounting during the removal proceeding because the administrator was not served with a citation to appear before the court for a settlement of accounts, as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-63, was meritless; hence, the probate court's order was not void. Ray v. Nat'l Health Investors, Inc., 280 Ga. App. 44, 633 S.E.2d 388 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Additional compensation upheld.</b> - Estate distribution plan providing for $50,000 in extra compensation to the estate administrator was upheld as the challenging sibling did not show that the payment varied the terms of the will, which was not in the record, and the administrator was permitted to petition the probate court for such additional compensation. After hearing any objections, the probate court allowed such extra compensation as the court deemed reasonable in consideration of the years of contentious litigation that was involved. In re Estate of Nesbit, 299 Ga. App. 496, 682 S.E.2d 641 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sounder and better construction of this statute,</b> touching the enforcement of judgments rendered by the ordinary (now probate judge) against executors and administrators on citations to account, is that mere money liabilities, when no specific fund is involved, are enforceable only by execution against the property, and not by attachment against the person. Paschal v. Melton, 174 Ga. 910, 164 S.E. 757 (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge may decide any presented question necessary.</b> - Provision that the ordinary (now probate judge) may "hear evidence upon any contested question, and settle finally between the distributee and administrator" means that in the hearing of such citation it is within the power of the court of ordinary (now probate court) to decide any presented question which it is necessary for the court to decide in order to determine whether the administrator has discharged all his duties with respect to the assets of the estate, and consequently how the administrator's account should be settled with the distributees. Brooks v. Brooks, 184 Ga. 872, 193 S.E. 893 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose.</b> - Statute does not restrict and confine the remedy of an accounting merely as against the administrator individually or as administrator; the statute's purpose is to require an accounting of the property of the estate that went into the administrator's hands, and could be maintained whether brought against one as administrator, or jointly as administrator and as an individual. Rowland v. Rowland, 204 Ga. 603, 50 S.E.2d 343 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction.</b> - There was evidence and legal authority to support the probate court's ruling that retirement funds belonged to the decedent's son because the son was named as beneficiary, and the funds did not pass into the decedent's estate because the executor testified that the executor concluded that the retirement funds were not an estate asset so the executor did not attempt to collect the funds from the son; resolution of the issue of the retirement proceeds in the context of a petition for settlement of accounts under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-63 fell within the probate court's jurisdiction, and the probate court did not err in failing to transfer the claim to the superior court under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-75 because the claim involved a conflict between the will and a designation of beneficiary, and not the construction of the will itself. In re Estate of Long, 307 Ga. App. 896, 706 S.E.2d 704 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court of ordinary (now probate court) has jurisdiction</b> of matters pertaining to the estates of deceased persons, jurisdiction over administrators, jurisdiction to compel administrators to account for the assets of an estate in their possession or custody, and jurisdiction in such cases to attach and punish for contempt. Melton v. Jenkins, 50 Ga. App. 615, 178 S.E. 754 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2202). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an administrator is cited for settlement before the court of ordinary (now probate court), under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2201, and one issue involved is whether certain certificates of deposit in a bank are the property of the estate and should be administered, the ordinary (now probate judge) in making settlement of the account between the administrator and the distributees, has jurisdiction to pass upon such issue, and the ordinary's decision therein becomes res judicata as to all distributees who are present at the hearing. Brooks v. Brooks, 184 Ga. 872, 193 S.E. 893 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-2202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Funds beneficiaries owed an estate.</b> - Case was remanded for a probate court to determine whether, and in what amount, any beneficiary owed funds to a decedent's estate, and to order such reimbursements, if the probate court found it appropriate based on the evidence adduced at the hearing because the executor showed projected and net distributions to the estate, accounting for the amounts owed by the beneficiaries, and evidence was adduced on that issue at the hearing, yet the probate court's order was silent thereon; a final settlement of accounts must resolve all pending issues.

<p class="p4"><b>Statute provides in part for the basis for an accounting,</b> and must be considered in the light of other sections of the Code concerning the duties of administrators and the penalties for failure to perform such duties. The object of the proceeding is to require of the administrator a full accounting concerning the discharge of the administrator's trust in a detailed statement of the administrator's actings and doings, and a settlement with the administrator's successor; and the paying of any portion of the estate which by evidence may be found to be due by the former administrator to the administrator's successor.

<p class="p11">A testator may, by will, dispense with the necessity of the personal representative's filing an annual return with the probate court or the beneficiaries or both, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or persons other than beneficiaries under the will. If a will was executed in another state and the will is valid in this state and under the laws of the state where the will was executed the personal representative would not have been required to file annual returns or if the will otherwise expresses an intent to relieve the personal representative from all reporting requirements, such a will shall be construed as dispensing with the necessity of annual returns in Georgia, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or parties other than beneficiaries under the will. In all wills, regardless of the date of execution, relief from filing returns with the court shall also relieve the personal representative from sending a copy of the return to the beneficiaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Statute provides that if in a sale by an administrator there be irregularities, or the administrator fails to comply with the law as to the mode of the sale, the sale is voidable except as to innocent purchasers. This statute applies also to sales by guardians, but it protects innocent purchasers against nothing except irregularities in carrying out a valid order. And the first part of the statute provides that "to divest the title of the heir at law, the administrator must have authority to sell." Powell v. Harrison, 180 Ga. 197, 178 S.E. 745 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1720). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Object and purpose.</b> - Object of this statute is to prevent the administrator from sacrificing the value of the property by putting the property up for sale under such circumstances that the purchaser would buy a lawsuit along with the land. The law deems it more expedient that the administrator should first end the lawsuit personally, and then sell for full value. Downing Lumber Co. v.

Wood v. Bowden, 182 Ga. 329, 185 S.E. 516 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 113-1717 and 113-1720).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Sale as void unless conducted in accordance with statute.</b> - When a record shows that the provisions of this statute have not been complied with, a sale must be held void. Fussell v. Dennard, 118 Ga. 270, 45 S.E. 247 (1903) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3446).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Withdrawing property from sale when highest bid falls below fair market value.</b> - An administrator not only has a right to withdraw an intestate's property from sale, but it is the administrator's legal duty to do so when it becomes apparent to the administrator that it is about to be sacrificed for want of a bid commensurate with its true market value, since nothing can be tolerated which comes into conflict or competition with the interest or welfare of those interested in the estate. Hall v. White, 215 Ga. 144, 109 S.E.2d 516 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-702). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the property involved was, at the time of the property's sale, reasonably worth $2,000.00, and the intestate's administrator sold the property to his wife for $600.00, knowing at the time that her bid was for an amount far less than its fair and reasonable market value, it was the legal duty of the administrator to have withdrawn the property from sale and not to have knocked it off to his wife - the highest bidder. Hall v. White, 215 Ga. 144, 109 S.E.2d 516 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-702). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the administrator and the administrator's wife, while property was being exposed for sale, requested various persons attending the sale as prospective purchasers not to bid on the property, the intestate's property was not exposed for sale under circumstances to command the best price obtainable. Hall v. White, 215 Ga. 144, 109 S.E.2d 516 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-702).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>As a general rule, an administrator cannot bid at an administrator's sale of property</b> belonging to an intestate's estate, and this rule applies to the administrator's wife just as it does to the administrator. Wallace v. Wallace, 142 Ga. 408, 83 S.E. 113 (1914) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4022); Warner v. Hill, 149 Ga. 464, 100 S.E. 393 (1919); Devaughn v. Griffith, 149 Ga. 697, 101 S.E. 794 (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4022); Hall v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale for payment of debts and distribution must comply with statute.</b> - Upon the death of the realty owner intestate, title vests directly in the heirs, subject to administration for payment of debts and distribution. Administrators can only sell real estate for these purposes after complying with former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-23, receiving leave to sell from the probate court, and proper advertisement. Horn v. Wright, 157 Ga. App. 408, 278 S.E.2d 66 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-23).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When a will contained the following:</b> "I wish my executor, as soon as possible after my death, to pay all my debts. If a sale of property shall be necessary I wish him to select for sale that which can be most advantageously used for that purpose; and I authorize him to sell the same at public or private sale, as he may see fit," under this provision, no application to the court of ordinary (now probate court) for leave to sell for the purpose of paying debts was necessary in order to exercise the power of sale. Wood v. Bowden, 182 Ga. 329, 185 S.E. 516 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1717).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When no authority for private sale of realty</b> is conferred by will, the executor thereunder is without power to enter into a contract for such sale of the property of the testator's estate; such a contract is violative of public policy, and is unenforceable. Fisher v. Pair, 69 Ga. App. 492, 26 S.E.2d 187 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1716).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An administrator is not under any duty immediately to sell real property</b> of the administrator's intestate after the expiration of the administration year; but, before the real property can be sold, it must distinctly be shown to the ordinary (now probate judge) that it is necessary to sell the land to satisfy one of the conditions referred to in this statute. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is not an absolute requirement of the law that an administrator shall sell all of the land of the estate at the expiration of the administration year and that the land shall be sold only for the payment of debts or distribution. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Allegation that the real property was not sold promptly or at the expiration of the administration year did not show a breach of the bond of the administrators as there is no requirement of the law that an administrator shall sell the real estate promptly after the administrator's qualification, nor does the law require that an administrator sell the real property at the expiration of the year. Patterson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 181 Ga. 61, 181 S.E. 776 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Infeasibility of division of the land and the necessity of a sale for the purpose of distribution is one of the purposes for which land may be sold by an administrator. Warren v. Warren, 104 Ga. App. 184, 121 S.E.2d 343 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Allegations to the effect that a sale by the executor should be enjoined because there are in fact no debts of the estate, afford no reason for the grant of an injunction, when the executor obtained from the ordinary (now probate judge) an order permitting the sale for the purpose of paying the indebtedness claimed by the executor to be due. Brewton v. McLeod, 216 Ga. 686, 119 S.E.2d 105 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, after due notice, leave has been regularly granted by the court of ordinary (now probate court) to an administrator to sell realty of a decedent, equity will not restrain the sale by injunction at the instance of an heir on account of reasons which could have been as readily urged in a caveat to the application for leave to sell. Brewton v. McLeod, 216 Ga. 686, 119 S.E.2d 105 (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of alteration of terms generally.</b> - When an administrator or executor alters the terms of a sale from those advertised, the administrator or executor can hold a purchaser to the altered terms only by showing clearly that the latter had actual knowledge of the altered terms before bidding off the property. Daniel v. Jackson, 53 Ga. 87 (1874) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2568).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legality of parol declarations as to altered terms of sale.</b> - Under the common law, printed or written particulars and conditions of sale could not be contradicted, added to, or altered by verbal declarations made by the auctioneer at the time of sale, but the Supreme Court is not disposed to apply this common-law rule so strictly as to exclude all parol declarations as to the altered terms of sale from the printed or written advertisements made by executors and administrators at their public sales, under the laws of this state, when the bidder or purchaser has full knowledge of such altered terms, and acts upon those terms. Adamson v. Petty, 230 Ga. 87, 195 S.E.2d 436 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1718).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale not set aside when specific terms of sale not advertised.</b> - Terms of a sale as advertised may be altered at the sale itself, and the mere failure of the administrator to advertise specific terms of sale is not a sufficient ground to set aside the sale, since the terms of the sale were announced on the day of the sale. Duncan v. Baggett, 247 Ga. 609, 277 S.E.2d 733 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1718).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of property to highest bidder approved.</b> - Probate court properly approved the sale of property belonging to the estate of a child's deceased parent to the highest bidders because all interested parties, including the child, understood the timeline for bidding on the property, and the child presented a $150,000 offer after the bidding period expired; the parties' agreed-upon sales procedure did not give heirs 30 days to counter any offer presented by another bidder. In re Estate of Gore, 292 Ga. App. 285, 664 S.E.2d 290 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale must be properly conducted.</b> - When administrator exposed the administrator's intestate's property for sale during the legal hours of sale, but intentionally selected a time for the sale, sold the property and personally purchased the property when no one was present at the place the administrator was required to sell except the administrator and the administrator's attorney, the petition sufficiently alleged that the administrator's sale of the property was not conducted under circumstances to command the best price, but the contrary for an amount equal to only one-half of its true value. Anderson v. Miller, 212 Ga. 477, 94 S.E.2d 321 (1956) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1707).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conditions of sale.</b> - Nothing in either O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-23 or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-24 enumerates what conditions may be placed upon a sale of real property. Buckmon v. Futch, 237 Ga. App. 67, 514 S.E.2d 863 (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-8-23 and 53-8-24).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchase authorized when administrator is also heir.</b> - When the administrator is an heir at law of an intestate, and as such has an interest in the property one is selling as such representative, he or his wife may purchase at his sale of the property, provided the administrator is guilty of no fraud, and it is exposed for sale in the ordinary mode and under circumstances to command the best price obtainable. Hall v. White, 215 Ga. 144, 109 S.E.2d 516 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1702). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the administrator, or his wife, is the purchaser of property in which the administrator, as an heir at law, has an interest, the administrator's sale of it to either will be upheld only when the sale is conducted legally and with absolute fairness to the intestate's other heirs at law and when the amount bid is an adequate price for the property sold. Hall v. White, 215 Ga. 144, 109 S.E.2d 516 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1702).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence supported leave to sell order</b> for purpose of payment of debts and distribution. Veale v. Vandiver, 167 Ga. App. 865, 307 S.E.2d 749 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-34). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because counsel's in-court statements and the documents in the court's file supported the findings that an estate property was hazardous and that a buyer would assume liability for it, and because a daughter acquiesced in conduct of the hearing, the probate court properly allowed the sale of the property under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-34. In re Estate of Bell, 274 Ga. App. 581, 618 S.E.2d 194 (2005) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-34).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When executor is clothed solely with power to sell,</b> and there is nothing to indicate an intention on the part of the testator to authorize the executor to sell at private sale, then the executor must sell after advertising and at public outcry. When the intention of the testator is in doubt as to the mode of sale, the safe rule is to adhere to the mode of sale prescribed by law. To take the case out of the general rule requiring executors to sell at public sale, the intention of the testator should be plainly and distinctly expressed in the words of the power, or should be found by necessary implication from the language used in conferring such power. Bonner v. Bell, 206 Ga. 98, 55 S.E.2d 612 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1717).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sales by public outcry.</b> - In accordance with the intention of the legislature as appears from a consideration of a partial history of former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-34, subsection (b) (now subsection (c)) applies only to private sales by administrators and not to sales by public outcry. Duncan v. Baggett, 247 Ga. 609, 277 S.E.2d 733 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-34).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale at public outcry.</b> - Sales by executors, if not otherwise provided by will, must be at public outcry to highest bidder. The purchaser is bound to see that the executor is apparently proceeding under the forms prescribed by law. If power be given in a will to sell land or personal property, this only dispenses with the necessity of an order of the court of ordinary (now probate court), and if the will does not expressly or impliedly provide for a private sale, such sales must be public; otherwise such sales are void. Bonner v. Bell, 206 Ga. 98, 55 S.E.2d 612 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1717).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Sale by administrator of land which is in adverse possession</b> of third party, and conveyance by deed in pursuance thereof, are void and convey no title. Porter v. La Grange Banking &amp; Trust Co., 187 Ga. 528, 1 S.E.2d 441 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1714); Toombs v. Hilliard, 209 Ga. 755, 75 S.E.2d 801 (1953);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1714).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Void deeds.</b> - Deeds by an administrator which are given while land is in the adverse possession of a third party, or without notice, are void and convey no title. Flournoy v. United States, 115 F.2d 220 (5th Cir. 1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1714).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Main reason that such sales are made void</b> is that property, though actually belonging to the estate, would not likely bring the property's full value when held adversely to the estate and the administrator could not give possession. Porter v. La Grange Banking &amp; Trust Co., 187 Ga. 528, 1 S.E.2d 441 (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1714).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof.</b> - Issue is whether or not property is subject to such sale, and burden of proof is upon administrator. Griffin v. Comarite, 41 Ga. App. 667, 154 S.E. 375 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4033). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the proof submitted is sufficient to establish title in the intestate at the time of death, and there is nothing whatever to indicate that the property is held by an adverse claimant, it will be presumed that possession accompanies title. Griffin v. Cromartie, 41 Ga. App. 667, 154 S.E. 375 (1930) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4033). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When it appears that administrator was in possession, burden is upon claimant to show title. Luttgen v. Andrews, 174 Ga. 778, 163 S.E. 892 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4033).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Selling off.</b> - When the same people are administrators of a wife's estate and executors of the husband's estate, and having obtained from the ordinary (now probate judge) orders to sell the lands belonging to each estate, if the heirs and legatees enter into an agreement that the entire property may be offered and sold together at one time, and the lands belonging to both estates are by the executors and administrators so cried off and sold at public sale, the sale cannot on that ground be afterwards treated as invalid by one who entered into such agreement. Guthrie v. Moran, 192 Ga. 607, 15 S.E.2d 890 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1720). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If it would have been unlawful to sell various tracts of land subject to several different security deeds collectively under a single bid, it should be presumed that the administrator who sold the property, the estate holding the security, complied with the law and sold the tracts separately, until the contrary is shown, and a recital stating that the various tracts were all sold to an individual for a stated sum of money without more would not show that they were not sold separately and at prices aggregating the entire sum stated. Fraser v. Rummele, 195 Ga. 839, 25 S.E.2d 662 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1720).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">An administrator cannot, without an order from the judge of the probate court, legally sell a promissory note payable to the administrator's intestate, which has come to the administrator's hands as assets.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order as an adjudication</b> - Before heirs are deprived of their right of inheritance, there not only must exist a necessity that the lands be sold by the administrator either to pay debts or to make distribution, the order granting leave to sell being evidence of such necessity, but also that the administrator actually sold the land; it is the sale under the order that divests the title. Sangster v. Toledo Mfg. Co., 193 Ga. 685, 19 S.E.2d 723 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Order by the ordinary's court (now probate court) is in effect not only leave to sell, but is an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that it is necessary for the land to be administered for one or the other or both of the purposes indicated in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 113-901 and 113-1706 (i.e., for payment of debts and distribution among the heirs) and that it is for the benefit of the heirs and creditors.

<p class="p4">When the estate consisted of approximately 50 acres with fractional interests as small as 1/280ths vested in great grandchildren of the testator, a division in kind was virtually impossible and the trial court did not err in appointing commissioners and directing a sale. Johnston v. Duncan, 227 Ga. 298, 180 S.E.2d 348 (1971) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1706).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2522, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1713, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-8-48 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Scope.</b> - Deeds in which the named grantor was decedent's estate, and which were signed in the name of the estate and of the two executors, were deeds by the executors of the estate in their official capacity and purported to convey properties belonging to the estate, and were not the personal deeds of the individuals designated as executors. Harrison v. Harrison, 214 Ga. 393, 105 S.E.2d 214 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1713). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It was the rule at common law that neither an executor nor an administrator could bind the estate by warranty of title, and the language of this statute has been applied to administrators and executors equally, the inclusion of the statute doing no more than to limit the liability of the fiduciary in the fiduciary's individual capacity. Smith Realty Co. v. Hubbard, 124 Ga. App. 265, 183 S.E.2d 506 (1971) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1713). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute does not say that an administrator with the will annexed cannot by administrator's deed convey good and marketable title to real estate owned by the decedent, or that if the administrator did so the administrator would be subject to an action at law because in the sale contract the administrator had in the administrator's representative capacity signed a contract of sale containing a general warranty of title. Smith Realty Co. v. Hubbard, 124 Ga. App. 265, 183 S.E.2d 506 (1971) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-1713).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Jordan v. Thornton, 7 Ga. 517 (1849) (decided under former law); Moore v. Turner, 148 Ga. 77, 95 S.E. 965 (1918);(decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3896). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assent from possession to a legacy of personal property will not be implied solely from the circumstance that both legatee and executor, who sustain the relation of mother and son, live in the same house, when the legatee is not in exclusive possession of the personalty devised. Johnson v. Thomas, 144 Ga. 69, 86 S.E. 236 (1915) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3896). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since there is a presumption that executors will perform their duties and will thus take care of estates entrusted to them, when nothing else appears, the assent of an executor to a legacy may be presumed or implied from possession of the property by the legatee. Holcombe v. Stauffacher, 201 Ga. 38, 38 S.E.2d 818 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-802).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Earle v. Barrett, 51 Ga. App. 514, 180 S.E. 855 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-802). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Title of a legatee being inchoate until the consent of the executor, express or implied, no right of action by a legatee to recover adversely held property by trover or ejectment is shown, unless such assent appears, but the assent of an executor to a legacy will be presumed, when a devisee of certain land and the executor are the same person, and the devisee in one's individual capacity has disposed of the land. Such an assent to a life tenant will inure also to the benefit of the remainderman in fee. Earle v. Barrett, 51 Ga.

<p class="p4">In suit in ejectment by remainderman claiming an undivided one-fourth interest under a devise in a will, against one claiming under a purchaser at a sale by administrators de bonis non cum testamento annexo, made for the purpose of paying debts and distribution, the evidence could not be taken to have proved a previous implied assent to the devise, by virtue of the fact that the life tenant, who, under the will had also been executor, had occupied the premises in dispute for three years, and while so doing had paid from one's individual resources certain items incurred for repairs to the property, when it was apparent that such executor had knowledge of the existence of debts for the payment of which the property was afterwards sold by a subsequently appointed representative of the estate. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-802). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the devisee and the executor are the same person, and the devisee remains in possession of the real estate for five years, during which time the executor returns the property for taxation as the executor's individual property, the assent of the executor to the devise will be presumed. Holcombe v. Stauffacher, 201 Ga. 38, 38 S.E.2d 818 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-802). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Assent presumed after lapse of time generally.</b> - When an estate is given for life to the widow of the testator with remainder to seven children, after the lapse of 30 years and upwards, the courts will presume that the life estate has vested by the assent of the executor, and with it the remainder in the remaindermen. Coleman v. Lane, 26 Ga. 515 (1858) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Residuary devisee has both title and the right of possession, according to the fact of the will, although assent of the executor (the executor having declined to qualify) be not affirmatively shown, the will having been probated more than 20 years; and although the devise of the residuum was after the payment of debts, etc., the existence of debts or charges upon the estate not being proved, the presumption after such a lapse of time being against their existence. Flemister v. Flemister, 83 Ga. 79, 9 S.E. 724 (1889) (decided under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2452). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assent of an executor to a devise will be presumed after the lapse of more than 30 years and when a finding that such assent was given will necessarily constrain a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff fails to rebut the presumption of assent, it is not error to direct a verdict for the defendant. Phillips v. Smith, 119 Ga. 556, 46 S.E. 640 (1904) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3320). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Provision of former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3895 and 3896 that a devise of land did not pass title until the devise has been assented to by the executors was for the purpose of keeping the property subject to the testator's debts, and, if from the lapse of time there was a presumption that there were no debts, the consent of the executors may be presumed, and the devisee may maintain ejectment to recover the land from an adverse claimant without proof of formal consent.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assent of an executor to the legacy of a tenant for life</b> inures to the benefit of the remaindermen, and they may, at the termination of the life estate, take possession immediately. The executor can recover possession only when it is necessary for the executor to have it for the purpose of executing the will, when it provides for a sale or other act to be done in order to effect a division among the remaindermen. Miller v. Harris County, 186 Ga. 648, 198 S.E. 673 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remaindermen and legacy.</b> - Presumed assent by an executor to a bequest of household and kitchen furniture to a person during the person's life or until the person's remarriage, and thereafter to other named persons including the executor, would inure to the benefit of the conditional or contingent legatees, where the executor joined with such other legatees in bringing trover action against the first legatee holding for life or until remarriage, and claimed title and right of possession of the bequeathed property under the legacy. Earle v. Barrett, 51 Ga. App. 514, 180 S.E. 855 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In suit in ejectment by remainderman claiming an undivided one-fourth interest under a devise in a will, against one claiming under a purchaser at a sale by administrators de bonis non cum testamento annexo, made for the purpose of paying debts and distribution, the evidence could not be taken to have proved a previous implied assent to the devise, by virtue of the fact that the life tenant, who, under the will had also been executor, had occupied the premises in dispute for three years, and while so doing had paid from her individual resources certain items incurred for repairs to the property, where it was apparent that such executor had knowledge of the existence of debts for the payment of which the property was afterwards sold by a subsequently appointed representative of the estate. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the executors named in the will take possession of the money and fail to turn it over to the life tenant, but convert it to their own use, on the death of the life tenant, the remaindermen named in the will may bring an action against such executors individually for a recovery thereof without alleging in express terms that the executors assented to the devise, since under such conditions, assent to the devise will be presumed. Paulk v. Smith, 56 Ga. App. 53, 192 S.E. 68 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, under the executor's assent to a devise for life with remainder over, the remainderman, after the death of the life tenant, becomes entitled to the immediate possession of the land, such land is no longer any part of the estate of the testator. Miller v. Harris County, 186 Ga. 648, 198 S.E. 673 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assent of an executor to a devise to a life tenant inures to the benefit of the remaindermen, and after such assent the vested interest of the remaindermen is subject to levy and sale, though the life estate is not terminated. Thornton v. Hardin, 205 Ga. 215, 52 S.E.2d 841 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debts do not prevent assent.</b> - Fact that there may have been debts does not prevent the executor from assenting to the legacy; and if assent is once given, it is generally irrevocable. Hemphill v. Simmons, 120 Ga. App. 823, 172 S.E.2d 178 (1969) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801); Dunagan v. Elder, 154 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assent considered irrevocable; remedy of unpaid creditor.</b> - As a general rule, an assent once given to a devise is irrevocable and perfects the inchoate title to the property in the devisee, if the assets of the estate may prove insufficient to pay the debts, in which case the remedy of an unpaid creditor is, generally, not to have the devised land subjected to a sale under an order of the ordinary (now probate judge), or under a judgment against the executor, but to follow the property into the hands of the devisee and there subject it at law or equity to the payment of the claim. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assent of an executor to a devise of land places title in the devisee, and assent once given is generally irrevocable. Walker v. Horton, 184 Ga. 429, 191 S.E. 462 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801); Miller v. Harris County, 186 Ga. 648, 198 S.E. 673 (1938);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When after an assent to a devise the property is levied on to satisfy a judgment against the devisee, the legal representative cannot reclaim the property merely because the devisee is indebted to the estate, or there are debts against the estate, pending the settlement of which assent could have been withheld. Whatever may be the remedy of creditors of the estate or other devisees in such case, the assent is binding upon the legal representative so long as it stands; and whether or not it might be revoked for cause such as fraud, accident, or mistake, in the instant case there was nothing to show a revocation, nor was there any evidence that the legal representative was not fully aware of the condition of the estate at the time of the assent, as found by the jury to have been given. Walker v. Horton, 184 Ga. 429, 191 S.E. 462 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There being evidence to authorize the inference that due assent to the devise had been given, and no evidence of its revocation or of ground for revocation, a charge to the jury, without qualification, that an assent to a devise cannot be withdrawn, was harmless to the claimant, if erroneous. Walker v. Horton, 184 Ga. 429, 191 S.E. 462 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rights of creditors superior to title of executor administering to oneself.</b> - An exception to general rule that assent to a devise is irrevocable even if the assets of the estate prove insufficient to pay debts in that an executor is precluded from administering to oneself as against the rights of creditors of whose claims one has notice. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assent may not be capriciously withheld.</b> - When it appears that the debts of the estate have been in fact paid, assent to legacies will be implied or should be ordered, since an executor cannot destroy a legacy by capriciously withholding assent. Moody v. McHan, 184 Ga. 740, 193 S.E. 240 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-802).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Derogation of rights of creditors will not be presumed.</b> - Since there is a presumption of law that executors act legally rather than illegally and do the things that they should do rather than those that they should not do, an assent by an executor to a legacy, in derogation of the rights of creditors, will not be presumed or implied, in the absence of plain and unequivocal facts upon which such an implied assent is based. Wilson v. Aldenderfer, 183 Ga. 760, 189 S.E. 907 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-802).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of guardian.</b> - Probate court properly reappointed an individual to act as guardian ad litem of unknown heirs in connection with a decedent's will and a declaratory judgment action commenced by a disqualified beneficiary, as there was nothing that prohibited such appointment, and the unknown heirs were entitled to representation pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-11-2(b).

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in refusing to declare an order appointing a guardian ad litem void based on the appointment occurring before the probate court judge was recused from the case as only orders made by the probate court judge after the recusal were null and void and the probate court judge appointed the guardian ad litem before the recusal motion was filed.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of assent.</b> - It was proper to dismiss without a hearing a caveat to a will based on lack of testamentary capacity because it was clear that the caveator's allegations were fatally deficient. The caveator had not sought to set aside the probate court's order probating the will; by signing a letter of assent, the caveator had consented to the immediate probate of the will, which established, among other things, that the testator had sufficient mental capacity; and although the caveator contended that distribution of the estate should be governed by an alleged contract between the parties, the caveator had not appealed the probate court's finding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the alleged contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Request for a jury trial.</b> - Probate court did not err in denying as untimely a child's demand for a jury trial because the child's first filing was on May 12 when the child's written and notarized acknowledgment of and assent to the petition for probate was filed with the petition for probate, and the written and notarized assent to the probate of a testator's will constituted an answer, a pleading; therefore, the child's written demand for a jury trial had to be filed by June 11, making untimely the child's demand filed on July 25.

<p class="p4">This section states the general requirement, upon the filing of a petition, a citation shall be issued, addressed to parties who are entitled to notice or service upon the filing of a petition. The citation will require that the objections be made in writing and will give the date by which objections must be filed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the citation is designed to inform the parties whether a hearing will be held on a date that is named in the citation or on a date to be later specified by the court.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a list of proceedings in which the petition may be granted without a hearing if no objections are filed, see OCGA Sec. 15-9-86.1. The requirements of subsection (b) reflect those of former OCGA Sec. 53-3-14(c).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretion to extend time for responses or objections to will.</b> - Before a will was probated, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-11-5 and 53-11-10(a) provided a probate court with discretion to extend the time for the filing of responses or objections to the will in order to preserve the interests of justice; the probate court properly extended the time for the decedent's widow to object or raise a claim under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-4-48 and to assert the statutory right to an intestate share after the initial acknowledgment and assent to the petition to probate the will which did not name her as a beneficiary. English v. Ricart, 280 Ga. 215, 626 S.E.2d 475 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Timely objections to amendment of year's support order.</b> - In a probate matter, the trial court erred by dismissing an executor's objection to the setting aside of certain real property as a year's support in favor of an estate as the executor had filed an objection within 15 days of the default order amending the year's support order, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-55(a), and by paying costs. The provisions of <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-55(a) relating to the opening of default judgments as a matter of right within 15 days of default applied to a year's support proceedings in probate court. In re Estate of Ehlers, 289 Ga. App. 14, 656 S.E.2d 169 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Caveat timely filed by estate administrator.</b> - Caveat filed by the court-appointed estate administrator was not untimely because, although the testator's children were represented by guardians ad litem and the petition to probate the will was served on the children no later than February 5, 2008, the estate remained unrepresented until an administrator was appointed on May 29, 2008; within 24 hours after appointment, the administrator filed a caveat to the will; and the administrator's objection to the proceeding in probate court was filed no later than 10 days after the date the person filing the objection was personally served.

<p class="p11"><b>Code Revision Committee Note on Comments.<br>
</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The comments appearing in this chapter have been prepared under the supervision of the Georgia Trust Code Revision Committee of the Fiduciary Law Section of the State Bar of Georgia and are included in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated at the request of the Committee. The comments were prepared by Anne S. Emanuel, Associate Professor at Georgia State University College of Law, reporter to the Georgia Trust Code Revision Committee, and were reviewed by the members of the Committee: William J. Linkous, Jr. and James H. Morgan, Jr., Co-Chairmen; Henry L. Bowden, Jr., Subcommittee Chairman; Michael D. Alembik, A. Kimbrough Davis, Herbert Elsas, John M. Graham, Barbara C. Hipple, S. Davis Laney, Joseph C. Miller, Jeffrey Pennell, James C. Rehburg, and Albert P. Reichert, Jr. They were presented to the General Assembly, in substantially this form, as part of the explanation for the changes proposed from prior law, and to clarify the meaning of the Act. Neither the General Assembly of Georgia nor the Code Revision Commission of the State of Georgia has participated in the drafting of these comments or has reviewed the comments for their content. The comments should not be considered to constitute a statement of legislative intention by the General Assembly of Georgia nor do they have the force of statutory law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retroactive application prohibited.</b> - Rights of the decedent's surviving spouse were already vested when the Revised Georgia Trust Code of 2010 (Revised Code), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-1 et seq., was enacted because under the terms of the amended trust agreement, the surviving spouse's rights to the trust assets took effect upon the decedent's death before the Revised Code took effect. Accordingly, any new obligation imposed by the Revised Code that would have impaired the surviving spouse's right to possession could not be applied retroactively. Rose v. Waldrip, 316 Ga. App. 812, 730 S.E.2d 529 (2012), cert. denied, No. S12C1888, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 981 (Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retroactive applicability of statute of limitations.</b> - Revised Georgia Trust Code's provisions apply to any trust irrespective of the date the trust was created, with two exceptions: to the extent it would impair vested rights, and except as otherwise provided by law. There is no vested right in a statute of limitation, and to the extent that Mayfield v. Heiman, 317 Ga. App. 322,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(2012), suggests that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-307(a) does not apply retroactively, that suggestion is non-binding dicta. Smith v. SunTrust Bank, 325 Ga. App. 531, 754 S.E.2d 117 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury instruction on standard of care.</b> - In a breach of trust action, the trial court did not apply an incorrect standard of care in that a co-trustee could only be held liable if the co-trustee failed to act in good faith because if there was any error, the error was created by the co-trustee since the co-trustee consented to the instructions given and failed to request a charge that clearly set forth what the co-trustee asserted to be the proper standard for acts performed with absolute discretion.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3732 and 3739, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-104, 108-105, 108-106, and 108-108, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-2, 53-12-20, and 53-12-26, and former Code Section 53-12-90 of the 1991 Trust Act are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Trust is an equitable obligation, either express or implied,</b> resting upon a person by reason of a confidence reposed in that person, to apply or deal with property for the benefit of some other person, or for the benefit of oneself and another or others, according to such confidence. Smith v. Francis, 221 Ga. 260, 144 S.E.2d 439 (1965) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

App. 401, 126 S.E.2d 865 (1962) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Trust fund may exist notwithstanding that beneficiaries may not be in existence</b> at time of its creation or be specifically named. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., 182 Ga. 348, 185 S.E. 504 (1936) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Property that can be subject of trust.</b> - Every kind of valuable property, both real and personal, that can be assigned at law may be a subject matter of trust. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., 182 Ga. 348, 185 S.E. 504 (1936) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parent of trust beneficiaries has no standing as an interested person.</b> - Parent 1 of children who were beneficiaries of an inter vivos trust established by parent 2 that covered any part of the children's expenses not met by parent 2's support payments after the divorce of the parents had no individual standing to pursue an action for breach of the trust agreement, removal of a trustee, or appointment of a receiver under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-176 on the ground that parent 1 routinely provided funds for the support of the children; parent 1 was not an interested person as defined in former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2) because support payments belonged to the children and not to parent 1, the obligation to support the children was that of both parents and not of the trust, and parent 1's provision of funds to support the children gave parent 1 no interest in or claim against the trust. Richards v. Richards, 281 Ga. 285, 637 S.E.2d 672 (2006) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trust estates.</b> - Estates may be created not for benefit of grantee but for use of some other person; they are termed trust estates; no formal words are necessary to create such an estate and whenever a manifest intention is exhibited that another person shall have the benefit of the property the grantee shall be declared a trustee. Finch v. Miller, 178 Ga. 37, 172 S.E. 25 (1933) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Introduction of evidence.</b> - Parties in an action to establish a trust are entitled to introduce, and the jury is entitled to consider, as tending to prove the intention of the parties, evidence relating to the nature and circumstances of the transactions and the conduct and declarations of the parties. Epps v. Wood, 243 Ga. 835, 257 S.E.2d 259 (1979) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Release and indemnification agreement did not meet definition of trust instrument.</b> - Trial court erred in ruling that the release provisions were facially void under the limits on trust instruments imposed by former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-194 and were not subject to enforcement through a breach of contract claim because the release and indemnification agreement did not meet the definition of a trust instrument set forth in former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2), and the beneficiaries and trustee executed them long after the creation of the trust and several years after the settlor's death. Heiman v. Mayfield, 300 Ga. App. 879, 686 S.E.2d 284 (2009) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Constructive trust may only be an implied trust</b> because all express trusts must be in writing under Georgia law. Gooden v. Buffalo Sav. Bank, 21 Bankr. 456 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient proof of the existence of an implied trust.</b> - Because a former husband did not present proof of the existence of an implied resulting trust under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-2(3), 53-12-90, 53-12-91, and 53-12-92 (see O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-2, 53-12-130, and 53-12-131), the trial court did not err when the court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the executor and the beneficiaries. Burnett v. Holroyd, 278 Ga. 470, 604 S.E.2d 137 (2004) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An express trust cannot be created by parol</b> and engrafted on an absolute deed. An express trust may not be impressed by parol evidence upon a deed. Fowler v. Montgomery, 254 Ga. 118, 326 S.E.2d 765 (1985) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trusts are implied:</b> (1) whenever the legal title is in one person, but the beneficial interest, either from the payment of the purchase money or other circumstances, is either wholly or partially in another; (2) when, from any fraud, one person obtains the title to property which rightly belongs to another; and (3) when, from the nature of the transaction, it is manifest that it was the intention of the parties that the person taking the legal title shall have no beneficial interest. Hemphill v. Hemphill, 176 Ga. 585, 168 S.E. 878 (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3732 and 3739).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied trusts are divided into two categories:</b> resulting trusts and constructive trusts, and sometimes it is exceedingly difficult to differentiate between the two; but ordinarily distinctions are unnecessary since both are implied trusts and are governed by the same rules. Hancock v. Hancock, 205 Ga. 684, 54 S.E.2d 385 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-104 and 108-106). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Implied trusts are either resulting or constructive, the latter arising if there is fraudulent conduct and no intent of the parties is involved. The implied resulting trust is based on the intention of the parties. Hall v. Higgison, 222 Ga. 373, 149 S.E.2d 808 (1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Generally, trusts arising under the first and third classification are resulting trusts, while those arising under the second classification are constructive trusts. Not infrequently in the case of resulting trusts no fraud exists, such trusts resting primarily on an implication of law from the nature of the transaction; but generally, if not necessarily, the element of fraud is present in constructive trusts. Hancock v. Hancock, 205 Ga. 684, 54 S.E.2d 385 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-104 and 108-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constructive trust is an implied trust,</b> and it has long been the rule in this state that implied trusts are not within the statute of frauds. Williams v. Whitfield, 242 Ga. 639, 250 S.E.2d 486 (1978) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Procedure when trust fails entirely.</b> - When the trust fails entirely, and the properties have to be sold as all parties agree is the case, then except for the amount set aside for charitable items, the testator has died intestate as to the excess in proceeds from that sale, and these funds must be held in a resulting trust for the heirs at law of the testator only. Green v. Austin, 222 Ga. 409, 150 S.E.2d 346 (1966) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suit to enforce implied trust must be brought within seven years.</b> - By analogy to the doctrine that an action for the recovery of land can be defeated by prescriptive title resulting from possession for seven years under color of title, an action to enforce an implied trust must generally be brought within seven years from the time the action accrues. Richards v. Richards, 209 Ga. 839, 76 S.E.2d 492 (1953) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitation period begins to run only upon notice of adverse possession.</b> - As long as a person who is in possession of the property of another, using the property for the owner's benefit, recognizes the latter's ownership, no lapse of time will bar the owner from asserting the owner's title as against the person in possession. Before any lapse of time will be a bar to the owner, it must appear that the person in possession has given notice or there must be circumstances shown which would be equivalent to notice, to the owner that the person in possession claims adversely to the owner. In such a case the statute will begin to run from the date of such notice. Until the owner has such notice, the owner has the right to treat the possession of the other person as the person's own.

<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3779 and 3786, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-117 and 108-501, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-1 and 53-12-150, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-4 of the 1991 Trust Act are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of section.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>108-501 created a method, unknown to the common law, by which a person having a claim against a trust estate for services rendered to the estate, for articles of property or money furnished for the use of the estate, or any claim for the payment of which a court of equity would render the estate liable, may pursue directly the assets of the estate itself. In such actions the trustee is made defendant. A judgment rendered in such proceeding does not impose liability upon the trustee personally, but binds only the trust estate. Oberdorfer v. Smith, 102 Ga. App. 336, 116 S.E.2d 308 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trustees as only necessary parties.</b> - Claim against a trust estate "for services rendered to said estate, or for articles or property or money furnished for the use of said estate, or any claim for the payment of which a court of equity would render said estate liable," may be enforced in a court of law, and in such a case the trustees are the only necessary parties. Zeigler v. Perry, 37 Ga. App. 647, 141 S.E. 426 (1928) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>3786 et seq.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This new remedy is merely cumulative of common law,</b> and it does not abolish the common law liability of the trustee personally either in tort or contract. Thus, if one wishes, a claimant may bring an action against the trustee individually. Oberdorfer v. Smith, 102 Ga. App. 336, 116 S.E.2d 308 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ordinarily, a charitable institution or corporation is not liable for the negligence of its officers and employees unless it fails to exercise ordinary care in their selection or fails to exercise such care in retaining them. A petition praying for general damages to be satisfied in part from charitable trust funds fails to state a cause of action when the petition fails to allege that the defendant was negligent in selecting or retaining employees. Burgess v. James, 73 Ga. App. 857, 38 S.E.2d 637 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">By parity of reasoning as regards those cases of statutory money rule against levying officers, which are not equity cases, and those of set off allowed by statute, the pursuit of the remedy allowed by statute does not make an "equity case" of which the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction. Robinson v. Lindsey, 184 Ga. 684, 192 S.E. 910 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Necessity of establishing facts.</b> - Claim against trust estate for services or for articles or money furnished to trust estate may be enforced in either court of law or court of equity. But in order to subject a trust estate to an obligation, the specific facts which render the estate liable for the debt claimed must be alleged and established by evidence. Aiken v. White, 208 Ga. 572, 68 S.E.2d 149 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trustee is amenable to court of equity</b> for faithful administration of trust. Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. v. Dooley, 193 Ga. 882, 20 S.E.2d 420 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction generally.</b> - All trusts are matters over which courts of equity may exercise jurisdiction in this state. O'Callaghan v. Bank of Eastman, 180 Ga. 812, 180 S.E. 847 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To preserve a trust estate, to supervise the estate's management, to hold the trustee to the line of duty, for the purpose of preserving the trust's corpus for the benefit of the beneficiaries, is an elementary branch of equity jurisprudence. The judge of the superior court of each county has power, either in term or at chambers, to remove and appoint trustees. When a court of equity obtains jurisdiction for one purpose, it will proceed to give full relief to all parties with reference to the subject matter of the action where it has jurisdiction for that purpose. Fine v. Saul, 183 Ga. 309, 188 S.E. 439 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a will expressly creates a trust and imposes special fiduciary duties on the person named executor, not as executor but as a trustee, and the executor has expressly or impliedly assented to the gift and taken over the property as trustee, it is plain that the executor is not amenable to a proceeding in the court of ordinary (now probate court), brought by a legatee for an accounting and settlement with respect to the trust; but relief must be sought by equitable action in the superior court where the defendant resides. McDowell v. McDowell, 68 Ga. App. 363, 22 S.E.2d 851 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although a will does not in terms create a trust, yet the manifest purpose of the language and the exigencies of the case require that equity shall decree and enforce a trust, the trust will be raised by implication, and the rule is the same. McDowell v. McDowell, 68 Ga. App. 363, 22 S.E.2d 851 (1942) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts of equity have jurisdiction to compel trustees to account for the trust funds in their hands,</b> especially when the accounts are complicated. Keaton v. Greenwood, 8 Ga. 97 (1850) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court properly found that the court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a petition seeking an order from the court voiding a trust created by a guardian's brother for the benefit of a ward and seeking return of the assets in the trust to the ward as trusts of every kind were peculiarly subjects of equity jurisdiction. In re Longino, 281 Ga. App. 599, 636 S.E.2d 683 (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 92 (Ga. 2007) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If trustee omits to act when required by duty to do so,</b> or is wanting in necessary care and diligence in the due execution of the trust which the trustee has undertaken, a court of equity will interpose. Jones v. Dougherty, 10 Ga. 273 (1851) (decided under former law); Fine v. Saul, 183 Ga. 309, 188 S.E. 439 (1936);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-117). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the trustee omits to act when required by duty to do so, or is wanting in necessary care and diligence in the due execution of the trust which the trustee has undertaken, a court of equity will interpose. The relief granted will always be molded and framed so as to render the trust effectual, and secure the best interests of all parties. A court of equity, having assumed jurisdiction over the trust for one purpose, will give effect to all the rights of the beneficiaries. Clark v. Clark, 167 Ga. 1, 144 S.E. 787 (1928) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3779).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interference with discretionary power.</b> - In the case of trusts cognizable in a court of equity only, if the trustees have a discretionary power to be exercised according to their judgment a court of equity will not interfere to control the trustees acting bona fide in the exercise of their discretion. Semmes v. Mayor of Columbus, 19 Ga. 471 (1856) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity has jurisdiction over charitable and religious trusts</b> and uses it in a particular and special manner. Harris v. Pounds, 64 Ga. 121 (1879) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Settlement of trust estate upon termination.</b> - Court of equity has jurisdiction to settle a trust estate at the time provided for the termination of the trust. That a court of law may have concurrent jurisdiction will not oust that of a court of equity. Park v. Park, 65 Ga. 746 (1880) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Executors are trustees</b> and are amenable to a court of chancery (now court of equity) for the faithful discharge of their trust. Johns v. Johns, 23 Ga. 31 (1857) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Article furnishes adequate remedy.</b> - On the subject of trusts and the mode of enforcing relief against trust estates justly indebted to those having claims upon them, our law is plain and furnishes a simple and ample remedy. Moore, Jenkins &amp; Co. v. Lampkin, 63 Ga. 748 (1879) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the plaintiffs seek to get a judgment against a trust estate for services rendered for such estate, plaintiffs must bring their action in accordance with the law; an ordinary judgment cannot be stretched to fit such circumstances. Blanford &amp; Thornton v. McGehee, 67 Ga. 84 (1881) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This entire statute simply means that any person having a valid claim against a trust estate may collect and enforce the payment of the claim without resorting to a court of equity, and the statute does not limit the liability of trust estates to the payment of such claims only as are indicated by the words "for services rendered to said estate, or for articles, or property, or money, furnished for the use of said estate." Miller v. Smythe, 92 Ga. 154, 18 S.E. 46 (1893) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Depletion by subjection to liability for negligence of trustee.</b> - Charitable trust funds may not be depleted by subjection to liability for negligence of trustee. Burgess v. James, 73 Ga. App. 857, 38 S.E.2d 637 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 1-8-501).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enforcement of contractor's lien</b> for improvements of trust estate is authorized. Williams v. Chatham Real Estate &amp; Imp. Co., 13 Ga. App. 42, 78 S.E. 869 (1913) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of church edifice for pastor's salary.</b> - Trust property of an unincorporated church in the hands of trustees can be subjected for a debt duly incurred to the pastor for salary and rent of parsonage, and, in the absence of other property, the church edifice and site in the hands of trustees can be subjected for such a debt.

<p class="p4"><b>Trust instrument controlled.</b> - In an appeal of an order granting a trustees' motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty, the court of appeals proceeded under the Revised Georgia Trust Code, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-1 et seq., as supplemented by the common law because even assuming that past distributions under the trust amounted to vested rights, the plaintiff could not show that the Revised Trust Code created any new trustees' obligations or impaired those rights in any relevant way; although the Revised Trust Code did not require a trustee to consider the resources of any beneficiary when determining whether to distribute trust property, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-245, the trust instrument affirmatively directed the trustees to do so.

<p class="p4"><b>Trustee's/executor's powers did not entitle trustee to ignore purpose of trust or commit waste.</b> - Trial court erred in concluding that a widow's considerable powers of control over two testamentary trusts as trustee and executor entitled her to summary judgment on two of the children's/beneficiaries' claims against the trust created for the purpose of supporting them during their lifetimes; she was required to diligently and in good faith ascertain whether they required support, and her powers over the assets did not entitle her to commit waste.

<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence.</b> - In all cases when a trust is sought to be implied, a court may hear parol evidence of the nature of the transaction, or the circumstances, or conduct of the parties, either to imply or rebut a trust. Jansen v. Jansen, 180 Ga. 318, 178 S.E. 654 (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3739). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While an express trust must be created by writing and cannot be proved by parol, implied trusts may be established by parol evidence, although the effect of such evidence is to alter or vary a written instrument, and although the defendant sets up and insists upon the statute of frauds.

<p class="p4">When temporary administrator brought an equitable action alleging that the administrator's intestate had purchased certain real estate and had agreed to place title jointly in the defendant's name in order to secure a debt owed defendant, and that defendant was to reconvey title to deceased and had refused to reconvey the half interest held in the defendant's name, the temporary administrator has alleged an implied trust in favor of the estate of the intestate from the facts and circumstances.

<p class="p4">When a grantee holds property impressed with a constructive trust in favor of the grantor, and conveys such property to another who has notice and knowledge of the circumstances creating the constructive trust, the latter takes the property subject to the equities of the original grantor and is a proper party in an action seeking to impress the property with a constructive trust.

<p class="p4"><b>Obtaining property fraudulently.</b> - Trust is implied when from any fraud one person obtains title to property which rightfully belongs to another. Jansen v.

<p class="p4">An implied trust arises wherever a person acquires the legal title to land or other property by means of an intentionally false and fraudulent verbal promise to hold the land for a certain specified purpose, and after having thus fraudulently obtained title, one retains, uses, and claims the property absolutely as one's own, so that the whole transaction by means of which the ownership is obtained is in fact a scheme of actual deceit. Jansen v. Jansen, 180 Ga. 318, 178 S.E. 654 (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3731 and 3739). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If by a false and fraudulent oral promise, which one intends at the time of making it afterwards to violate, the vendee of two contiguous parcels of land, which one has contracted for by separate and distinct contracts, induces the vendor to convey to one both parcels by one and the same absolute unconditional deed, one paying for one parcel but not for the other, equity by reason of one's fraud will fasten upon one a constructive trust on behalf of the vendor, as to the parcel not paid for, although the two parcels are not described in the deed as several tracts, but both together are treated as one tract. Jansen v. Jansen, 180 Ga. 318, 178 S.E. 654 (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3731 and 3739). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a conveyance absolute in form is made to one person, but the circumstances show that the real intention of the parties was not to make an absolute conveyance but a conveyance with restrictions or reservations, when it is alleged and appears that there was fraud on the part of the grantee to induce the execution of the deed, a court of equity will set up an implied trust in the property, by construing the conveyance so as to do full justice to the parties as their interests may appear, and in such cases the courts have held that to allow an oral agreement to be set up which restricts the original instrument does not contravene the statute of frauds, since the jurisdiction of the court is predicated upon the fraud of the grantee; and the parol evidence rule does not exclude oral testimony which tends to establish the fraud and show the real intention of the parties. Jansen v. Jansen, 180 Ga. 318, 178 S.E. 654 (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3731 and 3739). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it is the general rule that a parol trust cannot be grafted on an absolute deed, such instrument must be taken to mean a deed which is valid, not one without any good or valuable consideration, under which the grantee holds in fraud; under such circumstances, even though the language might otherwise be construed as setting up an express trust, it will nevertheless be taken as negativing any intent or purpose to pass title, and for such purpose it will be held to create a valid implied trust insofar as it imposes duties and obligations naturally arising from the nature of the transaction and the conduct of the parties. Pittman v. Pittman, 196 Ga. 397, 26 S.E.2d 764 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">While an express trust can only be shown by a writing, an implied trust may rest upon an express parol agreement, fraudulently made, by which a person acquires title to property of another; and in such case the express promise or agreement may be proved by parol to raise not an express but implied trust. Jenkins v. Lane, 154 Ga. 454, 115 S.E. 126 (1922) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3731). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">In order to set up an implied resulting trust in favor of one paying the purchase money where the title is placed in another, it is indispensable that it be shown that the purchase price was paid by the beneficiary of the trust at or before the time the conveyance was made, or that it be shown, other than by a void parol agreement, that it was the intent and purpose of the parties at the time the conveyance was made that the one claiming the benefit of the trust should pay the purchase money in conformity with such original intent and purpose of the parties. Such intent may be established by proof of an initial payment by the one claiming the benefit of the trust, at or before the time the title is conveyed to another. Loggins v. Daves, 201 Ga. 628, 40 S.E.2d 520 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-104, 108-105, and 108-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Petition seeking to establish an implied trust will fail when all the allegations relied on are based solely upon an oral agreement setting up an invalid express trust. If, however, it is made to appear from all the alleged facts and circumstances surrounding a transaction that an implied trust was established, the mere fact that there may have been an abortive attempt to establish by parol an express trust does not operate to destroy the implied trust which the facts and circumstances otherwise establish. Johnson v. Upchurch, 200 Ga. 762, 38 S.E.2d 617 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-104 and 108-105).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Recovery by owner of constructive trust.</b> - When a constructive trust arises in favor of an owner, the owner may enforce such trust by following the property or its product in the hands of a third person who is not a bona fide purchaser, whether the product be land, chattels, choses in action, or money. Pittman v. Pittman, 196 Ga. 397, 26 S.E.2d 764 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">While it is the general rule that a parol trust cannot be grafted on an absolute deed, such instrument must be taken to mean a deed which is valid, not one without any good or valuable consideration, under which the grantee holds in fraud; under such circumstances, even though the language might otherwise be construed as setting up an express trust, it will nevertheless be taken as negativing any intent or purpose to pass title, and for such purpose it will be held to create a valid implied trust, insofar as it imposes duties and obligations naturally arising from the nature of the transaction and the conduct of the parties.

<p class="p4">A verdict and decree in the plaintiff's favor for a one-half undivided interest in the property, if based upon the express agreement as to the interest to be owned by each of the parties, and not upon the proportion of the purchase money paid, would manifestly impinge upon the rule that an express trust cannot be created by parol and accordingly, any recovery or decree in the plaintiff's favor must be in proportion to the amount of the purchase money paid by the plaintiff, and could not be based upon the express agreement.

<p class="p4">When deed was wholly without any good or valuable consideration, other than trust assumed by grantee (to sell the land and pay grantors their half interest in the proceeds) and the only title at all that grantee could have had was a title in trust, claim of grantors was not an attempt to engraft on an otherwise good and valid absolute deed an extraneous parol trust, but an effort either to void the deed, or else to sustain it in the only way that it might possibly be given effect, if allowed to have any effect at all.

<p class="p4">Testator devised his property as follows: I will to my wife, R, for her to give to our children as they arrive of age as she may be able, keeping a memorandum so as each child shall be equal. It was held, that "the words 'for her to give,'" etc., in the will, construed in connection with the rest of the item, are not such precatory or recommendatory words as will create a trust. It is left discretionary with her to give off to the children as she is able, and it is not declared what she shall give off, whether the entire share of each child or only a part. Had the intention been apparent that the wife should hold or use the property for the benefit of the children during minority, a trust would have been created, although the words were not mandatory in form.

<p class="p4">Words, "I give, to my beloved wife, my wagons, buggy, and also my household and kitchen furniture, all without limitation or reserve, for her to do as she thinks best for herself and all of my lawful heirs," are not sufficient precatory words to create a trust because the wife was first given without reserve or limitation.

<p class="p11">A resulting trust is a trust implied for the benefit of the settlor or the settlor's successors in interest when it is determined that the settlor did not intend that the holder of the legal title to the trust property also should have the beneficial interest in the property under any of the following circumstances:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(1) A trust is created but fails, in whole or in part, for any reason; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3740 and 3741, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-27 and 53-12-91 of the 1991 Trust Act are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Resulting trust is an implied-in-fact or inferred trust.</b> It is not based upon fraud or misrepresentation. On the contrary, the basis of the true constructive trust is fraud, actual or "constructive." Jackson v. Jackson, 150 Ga. 544, 104 S.E. 236 (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3740 and 3741). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When A pays the purchase money and causes the deed to be made to A's spouse, and an oral agreement to hold in trust for A is shown to rebut the presumption of gift, the majority view is that the trust is nevertheless resulting if the oral agreement is not different from the agreement which would be implied if the grantee were legally a stranger to A. Jackson v. Jackson, 150 Ga. 544, 104 S.E. 236 (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3740 and 3741). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a divorce, a husband did not show that the transfer of the marital home to the wife for "love and affection" to protect the home from possible future creditors created an implied resulting trust under which the wife held the home for the husband because the husband did not show an express trust had been created or fully performed without exhausting trust property. Brock v. Brock, 279 Ga. 119, 610 S.E.2d 29 (2005) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-91).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loan funds deposited for the purpose of paying a specific creditor.</b> - Repayment of the loan was not a transfer of an interest of the debtor's property and, therefore, not voidable as a preferential treatment since the funds were loaned to be applied to pay a specific creditor, debtor deposited the funds into a checking account the sole purpose of which was to satisfy that obligation, the debtor understood that the funds could not be used for any other purpose, and the balance in the account always exceeded the amount of the loan before the debtor repaid defendant. Tidwell v. Hendricks (In re McDowell), 258 Bankr. 296 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-91).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Rebuttal of resulting trust.</b> - Resulting trust may be rebutted even by parol declarations of the person in whose favor the trust would otherwise be raised; and it is effectually rebutted by a subsequent deed taken by the same parties proffering to follow the very same trusts. Adams v. Guerard, 29 Ga. 651, 76 Am. Dec. 624 (1859) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An express oral agreement of the wife to hold in trust for the husband will not operate to defeat the so-called resulting trust. Jackson v.

<p class="p4"><b>Inadequate allegation of resulting trust.</b> - In an action in which the patients alleged that the hospital was a not-for-profit corporation that charged inflated rates to uninsured patients and used excessively aggressive tactics to collect on unpaid bills, the tax exemption granted under I.R.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 501(c)(3) did not create a trust, express or implied, resulting or constructive; furthermore, the patients did not adequately allege a resulting or constructive trust pursuant to former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-91 and 53-12-93 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-130 and 53-12-132), respectively.

<p class="p4"><b>Genuine issue of material fact as to whether a constructive trust should be implied.</b> - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a record title holder in a quiet title action because a disputed question of material fact existed whether the holder had agreed to deed back the properties at issue to the claimant after financing fell through; thus, a dispute existed as to whether a constructive trust should be implied under the circumstances. Ansley v. Raczka-Long, 293 Ga. 138, 744 S.E.2d 55 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting an ex-husband summary judgment as to the ex-wife's and mother's implied trust claim because there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether an implied constructive trust arose at the time of the 2008 conveyance. Robertson v. Robertson, 333 Ga. App. 864, 778 S.E.2d 6 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assuming that a widow's counterclaim against her late husband's two siblings for failure to continue mortgage payments on a home that the husband had bought for another sibling was for a constructive trust on the property, the widow was not entitled to summary judgment because the familial gift presumption applicable to purchase money resulting trusts could apply, or the husband's contributions toward the home could be considered gifts or voluntary payments. Roberts v. Smith, 341 Ga. App. 823, 801 S.E.2d 915 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insufficient evidence of a resulting trust.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a parent and trustee of the parent's trust in a suit brought by a child to obtain a half interest in certain real property by the imposition of a resulting trust as there was no dispute that no consideration was paid by the child for the property when the property was acquired. Rosado v. Rosado, 291 Ga. App. 670, 662 S.E.2d 761 (2008) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-91). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">With respect to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in which the debtor, a business that served as an intermediary for clients desiring to effect exchanges of real property qualifying for tax-deferred treatment under 26 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1031, held funds in bank accounts that resulted from certain real estate sales, two real estate exchange investors were not entitled to a turnover of proceeds from sales of their real estate, as opposed to having their claims payable on the same basis as the other unpaid exchangers, because the written agreements between the investors and the debtor specifically and unequivocally defined the circumstances under which the debtor acquired cash proceeds and the use and disposition of those proceeds, but did not create an express trust under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-20 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-20).

<p class="p4">Best interest of creditors' test under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1325(a)(4) was not met by the proposed plan of Chapter 13 debtors because the plan did not account for the recoverable value of the debtor's transfer of the debtor's interest in property given to the debtor by the debtor's mother.

<p class="p4"><b>Tax exempt status did not create resulting trust.</b> - Uninsured patients could not challenge hospital's tax exempt status under 26 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 501(c)(3) by alleging that the hospital breached an implied charitable trust in the hospital's billing and collection policies for uninsured and indigent patients because the tax exempt status did not meet the definition of a resulting trust in former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-91 (see O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-130), because there was no allegation of any frustrated intent to form a trust on the part of a settlor.

<p class="p4"><b>Resulting trusts excepted from statute of frauds.</b> - That the Code excepts from the statute of frauds resulting and constructive trusts is not open to doubt. Jackson v.

<p class="p4"><b>Intention to make a gift.</b> - As between husband and wife, parent and child, brother and brother, or sister and sister, payment of the purchase money of land by one of the correlatives, and causing the conveyance to be made to the other, will generally suggest an intention to make a gift. This may or may not prevent a resulting trust, according to the circumstances of the particular transaction. Certainly, a trust for the benefit of the one paying the money does not necessarily result. Printup v. Patton &amp; Jackson, 91 Ga. 422, 18 S.E. 311 (1893) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Property between spouses.</b> - When the court charged that if the husband conveyed property to the wife and she paid the remainder of the purchase price without anything showing that it was for the purpose of securing the part paid, a presumption arises that it was a gift which may be rebutted; there was no application and the principle announced in Gould v. Glass, 120 Ga. 50, 47 S.E. 505 (1904). Barnett v. Strain, 151 Ga. 553, 107 S.E. 530 (1921) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3740). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">After a debtor appealed a bankruptcy court's order finding that the debtor's transfer of half interest in three lots of real property to the debtor's spouse was a fraudulent conveyance, the debtor's spouse was not entitled to an implied purchase money resulting trust. The spouse did not pay consideration for the property to be transferred to the debtor when the debtor initially acquired the property, and the spouse did not own a half interest in the property by virtue of a purchase money resulting trust or otherwise.

<p class="p4"><b>Requirements to show existence of purchase money resulting trust.</b> - In order to establish the existence of a purchase money resulting trust, one must show that such a trust was contemplated by both parties by way of an agreement that is either express or implied by the circumstances or conduct of the parties and such an agreement must have existed at the time the transaction was consummated. Burt v. Skrzyniarz, 272 Ga. 35, 526 S.E.2d 848 (2000) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-92).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">With the undisputed evidence showing a voluntary, intentional, and deliberate gift of the property by the husband to the wife, who had no knowledge of the transaction, and made no promise or agreement to hold the property for the husband, such gift cannot be cut down to an implied or resulting trust by events subsequently transpiring; and therefore, the declarations of the wife, after she had knowledge of the deed, as to the ownership of the property, and the payment of taxes and the making of improvements on the property by the husband, are insufficient to establish a resulting trust. Williams v. Thomas, 200 Ga. 767, 38 S.E.2d 603 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An absolute gift will not be cut down by implication into a trust merely because the donor hoped and believed, at the time the gift was made, that the donee would share the beneficial interest of the property with the donor or with a third person. It must appear from the entire transaction that there is an obligation on the part of the holder of the legal title to hold the property for the benefit of someone else. Williams v. Thomas, 200 Ga. 767, 38 S.E.2d 603 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illegal acts may not constitute basis for trust.</b> - Husband who, in order to delay or defeat the collection of a claim for alimony or other lawful demands against him, conveyed land to another person and put that person in possession, could not maintain against the latter an action for the breach of a bond given by him to reconvey the land whenever so required. This is so, not because the law is disposed to aid one of the wrongdoers in retaining the fruits of the unlawful transaction, but because the law denies the benefit of the law's remedies to the other. Langan v. Langan, 224 Ga. 399, 162 S.E.2d 405 (1968) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-106 and 108-116).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Joint purchasers of property cannot intend to simultaneously create both a tenancy in common and a purchase money resulting trust.</b> - Resulting trust may be found to exist if it is found that a tenancy in common was not established when the property was purchased, however, joint purchasers of property cannot intend to simultaneously create both a tenancy in common and a purchase money resulting trust since the two cannot co-exist. Burt v. Skrzyniarz, 272 Ga. 35, 526 S.E.2d 848 (2000) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-92). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After the debtor sought a determination of the validity and extent of a lien held by a creditor on certain properties and also asserted that, even if the lien was valid, the properties were subject to equitable interests held by other entities, the court could not weigh and balance the evidence needed to determine whether purchase money resulting trusts arose under Georgia law on summary judgment.

<p class="p4"><b>Husband and wife.</b> - When a husband pays the purchase money of land from his own funds and has the land conveyed to his wife, the presumption which the law makes is that the husband intended to make a gift to his wife; but the presumption is a rebuttable one, and a resulting trust in favor of the husband may be shown.

<p class="p4">If a husband buys and pays for land, and takes a deed in his wife's name, a presumption arises that he intends to make an absolute gift to her; and in order to overcome this presumption he must show something which raises an obligation in her to hold the property in trust for him.

<p class="p4">When a husband pays the purchase money of land from his own funds and has the land conveyed to his wife, the presumption which the law makes is that the husband intended to make a gift to his wife; but the presumption is a rebuttable one, and a resulting trust in favor of the husband may be shown. Parol evidence of the nature of the transaction, or the circumstances, or the conduct of the parties, is admissible to rebut the presumption of a gift; but in order to rebut the presumption of a gift the proof must be clear and convincing.

<p class="p4">Resulting trust, as between husband and wife where the husband pays the purchase money and title is taken in the name of the wife, rests upon the intention of the parties at the time of the transaction, with the presumption being that the transaction was a gift. Parol proof of conduct, circumstances, and declarations is admissible as tending to show the intent of the parties; and such evidence might ordinarily, if sufficiently clear and convincing, authorize a jury to find that the intention of the parties was that the conveyance should be in trust and not a gift. But when the undisputed testimony of the husband, who seeks to establish the trust, shows a deliberate and intentional gift, such gift cannot be cut down to a trust by proof of subsequent events. Williams v. Thomas, 200 Ga. 767, 38 S.E.2d 603 (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3739, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-104 and 108-107, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-32, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-93 of the 1991 Trust Act are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Not a remedy for simple breach of contract.</b> - While Georgia law recognizes that a constructive trust may be imposed upon property acquired by fraud, a constructive trust is not a remedy for a simple breach of contract or breach of a promise. Perkins v. Crown Fin., LLC (In re Int'l Mgmt. Assocs., LLC),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 2016)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Post-bankruptcy retirement benefits held in constructive trust for ex-spouse.</b> - Debtor held any post-bankruptcy petition payment that the debtor might receive on the debtor's retirement benefit in constructive trust for the debtor's ex-spouse to the extent of one half of such net benefit, since established principles of equity would not allow the debtor to be unjustly enriched at the ex-spouse's expense by discharging in bankruptcy an interest in a benefit established by a final divorce decree. Farrow v. Farrow, 116 Bankr. 310 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-32).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loan funds deposited for the purpose of paying a specific creditor.</b> - Repayment of the loan was not a transfer of an interest of the debtor's property and, therefore, not voidable as a preferential treatment, since the funds were loaned to be applied to pay a specific creditor, debtor deposited the funds into a checking account the sole purpose of which was to satisfy that obligation, the debtor understood that the funds could not be used for any other purpose, and the balance in the account always exceeded the amount of the loan before the debtor repaid defendant. Tidwell v. Hendricks (In re McDowell), 258 Bankr. 296 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-93).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No trust for nontitled tenant.</b> - When evidence authorized the trial judge to conclude as a matter of law that defendant occupied premises as a tenant after conveying title to the property, no constructive trust implying a life estate was shown. Pope v. Hendley, 206 Ga. App. 773, 426 S.E.2d 607 (1992) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-93 of the 1991 Trust Act).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constructive trust arises not from the intent of the parties, but by equity</b> with respect to property acquired by fraud, or although acquired without fraud, since it is against equity that the property should be retained by the one who holds the property. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Weekes, 241 Ga. 169, 244 S.E.2d 46 (1978) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-104).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constructive trust would defeat bankruptcy trustee's avoidance action.</b> - Creditor could defeat a trustee's 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§§</span> 547 and 548 actions by proving that the trustee could have successfully impressed a constructive trust on property under Georgia law prior to the debtor's transfer of the debtor's legal interest in that property to the trustee. Kelley v. McCormack (In re Mitchell), 548 Bankr. 862 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actions of guardian.</b> - Guardian cannot, either directly or indirectly, buy property of the guardian's ward at a sale thereof by some other person or authority, as a creditor of the ward selling at public auction under a power of sale. If the guardian does by such means acquire the legal title to property of the guardian's ward, the guardian will be deemed a trustee as to such property at the election of the ward or the ward's heirs at law. Allen v. Wade, 203 Ga. 753, 48 S.E.2d 538 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If, after appointment of one as guardian of another's property, one buys a tax claim against one's ward's estate, as by obtaining a deed to oneself from a county conveying land which the county had previously purchased as the property of the ward at a tax sale, one will be treated in equity as holding under such deed as trustee for one's ward. Allen v. Wade, 203 Ga. 753, 48 S.E.2d 538 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Obtaining items by trick, fraud, or other wrong act.</b> - When one by a trick, or a fraud, or other wrongful act, obtained money from the trustee of the victim, one was, unless one had some other or better right thereto, an involuntary trustee of the thing gained for the benefit of the person who would have otherwise had the thing. Cordovano v. State, 61 Ga. App. 590, 7 S.E.2d 45 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When defendant obtained money by fraud and trickery ("the telegram racket") in order to prevent the defendant from taking advantage of defendant's own wrong, a naked, constructive, ex maleficio trust would be imposed by operation of law upon the property thus obtained even though it was contrary to the defendant's intention and will, and the defendant became a trustee ex maleficio for such property; the defendant was trustee ex maleficio of a naked ex maleficio trust, which required no action on the defendant's part beyond the turning over or returning of the money to the beneficiary, the victim. Cordovano v. State, 61 Ga. App. 590, 7 S.E.2d 45 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liens upon crops.</b> - When after signing a waiver of all liens upon the crops grown by a tenant in favor of a lien of a third party for advances to aid in making crops, the landlord receives the proceeds from the crops, which are sufficient to satisfy the lien for advances, and converts the land to the third party's own use, a petition of the holder of the lien for such advances against the landlord and the tenant, seeking judgment against them as trustees ex maleficio for the full amount of such advances, states a cause of action against both the owner and tenant. Trapnell v. Swainsboro Prod. Credit Ass'n, 208 Ga. 89, 65 S.E.2d 179 (1951) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied trust created.</b> - When land is purchased by one with the money of others, under an agreement and understanding that title is to be taken in the name of all, and the one procures a deed to the land but causes the deed to be made to oneself alone, an implied trust will arise in favor of the others as to an undivided interest in the land. Chapman v. Faughnan, 183 Ga. 114, 187 S.E. 634 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the estate of the decedent consisted in part of land, and one of the heirs at law of the decedent is in possession thereof under an agreement with one's cotenants to act as their agent, and one procures another person to administer on the estate for the purpose of divesting the title of the other heirs at law and obtaining it personally, and does thus obtain the title, and conceals one's acts and doings with respect thereto from one's cotenants and principals, a court of equity would decree such title to be void, and the defendant to hold as trustee for those entitled to it. Lanier v. Dyer, 222 Ga. 30, 148 S.E.2d 432 (1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actions of agents and creation of trusts.</b> - When an agency is established, the agent will be held to be a trustee as to any profits, advantages, rights, or privileges under any contract made and obtained within the scope and by reason of such agency; and where the agent invests such profits in property or places the same to one's credit in a bank, one will be held to hold the property as trustee for the principal, and the latter can maintain in a court of equity an action to trace such profits into such investments, and to enjoin the agent or the donee from selling, disposing of, or incumbering any such profits or any property in which the profits have been invested. Smith v. Harvey-Given Co., 182 Ga. 410, 185 S.E. 793 (1936) (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3739).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud in marriage.</b> - When a woman marries a man, knowing that she has a living husband to whom she is married, such fact being unknown to the second husband, she perpetrates such fraud as will authorize cancellation of a deed to her made upon love and affection by her purported husband. Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 251 S.E.2d 235 (1978), overruled on other grounds, Stokes v. Stokes, 246 Ga. 765, 273 S.E.2d 169 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a wife guilty of adultery unknown to her husband importunes him to make a gift of property to her in contemplation of her renewed adultery and possible elopement, the gift will be revoked as a fraud upon the husband. Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 251 S.E.2d 235 (1978), overruled on other grounds, Stokes v. Stokes, 246 Ga. 765, 273 S.E.2d 169 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a promise of the wife was the consideration inducing execution of a deed, and such promise was fraudulently made with intent not to comply, such deed may be set aside for inceptive fraud. Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 251 S.E.2d 235 (1978), overruled on other grounds, Stokes v. Stokes, 246 Ga. 765, 273 S.E.2d 169 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Equity interest created.</b> - Although there was no purchase money resulting trust created under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-90, 53-12-91, and 53-12-92 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 53-12-2, 53-12-130, and 53-12-131), a decedent's mother was entitled to an equity interest in property of the deceased daughter because a constructive trust was established under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-93 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-132) and there was evidence of a gift of land under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-132, as an exception to the statute of frauds, in that the mother lived on the property, made valuable improvements, and paid meritorious consideration.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred by granting the appellees' motion for summary judgment as to the claim for imposition of a constructive trust because material issues of fact remained as to whether the appellees, inconsistently with the appellants' rights and contrary to equity, exercised dominion over their property. Bo Phillips Company, Inc. v. R. L. King Properties, LLC, 336 Ga. App. 705, 783 S.E.2d 445 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Genuine issue of material fact as to whether a constructive trust should be implied.</b> - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a record title holder in a quiet title action because a disputed question of material fact existed whether the holder had agreed to deed back the properties at issue to the claimant after financing fell through; thus, a dispute existed as to whether a constructive trust should be implied under the circumstances. Ansley v. Raczka-Long, 293 Ga. 138, 744 S.E.2d 55 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting an ex-husband summary judgment as to the ex-wife's and mother's implied trust claim because there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether an implied constructive trust arose at the time of the 2008 conveyance. Robertson v. Robertson, 333 Ga. App. 864, 778 S.E.2d 6 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Assuming that a widow's counterclaim against her late husband's two siblings for failure to continue mortgage payments on a home that the husband had bought for another sibling was for a constructive trust on the property, the widow was not entitled to summary judgment because the familial gift presumption applicable to purchase money resulting trusts could apply, or the husband's contributions toward the home could be considered gifts or voluntary payments. Roberts v. Smith, 341 Ga. App. 823, 801 S.E.2d 915 (2017). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court denied a bankruptcy trustee's motion for summary judgment on the trustee's claim that the trustee was allowed under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 548 to avoid a transfer of a partial interest in real property a Chapter 7 debtor made less than two years before the debtor declared bankruptcy; there were genuine issues of fact concerning the transferee's claim that the debtor's mother transferred an interest in the property to the debtor by mistake, that family members agreed that the property would be given to the transferee as compensation for care the transferee provided to the debtor's mother, that the debtor held an interest as a purchase money resulting trust or a constructive trust under Georgia law, and that the debtor made the transfer to correct that error.

<p class="p4">Denial of a sister's and an executor's motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict was reversed as a constructive trust could not be imposed over the proceeds of a condemnation since: (1) a mother did not make any agreement with her children regarding the quitclaim deeds or the proceeds of the condemnation; (2) the documents signed by the siblings were unequivocal and unrestricted; (3) the mother did not make any promise with the intent not to carry it out; (4) there was nothing to indicate that when the mother obtained a certificate of deposit and opened a money market account in her and the executor's and the sister's names as joint tenants with right of survivorship, she meant to do anything other than that; and (5) the siblings did not raise the issue of a constructive trust in the condemnation proceedings and were collaterally estopped from raising the issue in a later action.

<p class="p4"><b>Constructive trust established.</b> - Jury's finding that a decedent's purported second spouse was entitled to an equitable interest in a home that the spouse shared with the decedent was supported by the evidence, albeit slight, since the spouse and the decedent paid the mortgage from a joint account and the spouse continued to make payments on the house following the decedent's death.

<p class="p4">Evidence supported a finding that the life insurance funds from the deaths of a daughter's parents in the hands of the daughter's grandmother were subject to a constructive trust since the insurance company paid the funds to the grandfather based on the acquiescence of the daughter's uncle, who was the administrator of the parents' estates, and the assertion that the parents' deaths were simultaneous, which acquiescence, in light of the contrary evidence and in light of the uncle's own conclusion that the mother died first, was a breach of the uncle's fiduciary duties owed to the daughter; the evidence showed that the grandfather would have been unjustly enriched by retaining those insurance funds that should have been paid to the daughter through the estates; receiving the proceeds under the grandfather's will, the grandmother was also not an innocent purchaser and therefore took title to the proceeds subject to the trust impressed upon them.

<p class="p4">Conduct and declarations of the parties subsequent to the transfer, which are consistent with an agreement to hold the property for the benefit of another, may be evidence of a constructive trust. Dodd v. Scott, 250 Ga. App. 32, 550 S.E.2d 444 (2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-94).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of parol evidence.</b> - An implied trust reflecting the true intentions of the parties may be established by parol evidence, although the effect of such evidence is to alter or vary a written instrument. In re Gaites, 466 F. Supp. 248 (M.D. Ga. 1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court did not err in allowing parol evidence to establish an implied trust</b> in favor of the grantor, notwithstanding the warranty deed from the grantor to the grantor's brother, since it was agreed the grantor would continue residing in the house for the grantor's lifetime upon payment of taxes and insurance. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Smith, 179 Ga. App. 399, 346 S.E.2d 848 (1986) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-34).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence proper to determine creation of implied trust.</b> - Earmarking doctrine did not apply because there was no substitution of one creditor for another, and although the only written documentation of the loan was a promissory note, parol evidence could be used to determine if the loan created an implied trust. Tidwell v. Hendricks (In re McDowell), 258 Bankr. 296 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-94).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence rule.</b> - Allegations and proof under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106 need not conform to the parol evidence rule as stated in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 38-501 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-6-1). Guffin v. Kelly, 191 Ga. 880, 14 S.E.2d 50 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-106).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied trusts not within statute of frauds.</b> - Implied trusts are not within the statute of frauds, and the courts will hear parol evidence, showing the facts from which the trusts are sought to be implied. Alexander v. Alexander, 46 Ga. 283 (1872) (decided under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2290 and 2291); Jackson v. Jackson, 150 Ga. 544, 104 S.E. 236 (1920); Guffin v. Kelly, 191 Ga. 880, 14 S.E.2d 50 (1941);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-108). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In all cases where a trust is sought to be implied, the court may hear parol evidence of the nature of the transaction, or the circumstances, or conduct of the parties, either to imply or rebut a trust. Hemphill v. Hemphill, 176 Ga. 585, 168 S.E. 878 (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3732 and 3739). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While an express trust must be created by writing, and cannot be proved by parol, implied trusts may be established by parol evidence, although the effect of such evidence is to alter or vary a written instrument, and although the defendant sets up and insists upon the statute of frauds. Sykes v. Reeves, 195 Ga. 587, 24 S.E.2d 688 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-108); Hall v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>To engraft an implied trust upon an absolute deed by parol evidence,</b> such evidence ought to be clear and satisfactory. Brown v. Leggitt, 226 Ga. 366, 174 S.E.2d 889 (1970) (decided under former law); Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Smith, 179 Ga.

<p class="p4">Deed absolute in form may be shown by parol evidence to have been made in trust for the benefit of the grantor when the maker remains in possession of the land. Hall v. Turner, 198 Ga. 763, 32 S.E.2d 829 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-108).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Gentlewomen are not ordinarily objects of "suffering humanity;"</b> however, the phrase "Home for Gentlewomen," could be construed as creating an institution for the promotion of "human civilization." Bramblett v. Trust Co., 182 Ga. 87, 185 S.E. 72 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Hospital</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hospital is not, any more than a drugstore, a charitable institution per se;</b> and, in order for a devise or other gift establishing a hospital to come within the classification of a charitable institution, the terms of the gift must themselves require that it be operated in whole or at least in substantial part for the gratuitous relief of its inmates. Trust Co. v. Williams, 184 Ga. 706, 192 S.E. 913 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-201 and 108-202); Moss v.

<p class="p4">Fact that a hospital is to be created as a memorial to the testator and others does not operate to change the rule that hospitals are not per se charitable institutions, so as to make the legacy a valid charitable trust. Trust Co. v. Williams, 184 Ga. 706, 192 S.E. 913 (1937) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-201, 108-202, and 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While a hospital is not per se a subject of charity, and it depends upon the service given as to whether or not it is a subject of charity within the meaning thereof, nevertheless a devise "to the Masonic Hospital of Georgia, for tubercular children" is a charitable bequest within the meaning of the statute. Creech v. Scottish Rite Hosp. for Crippled Children, 211 Ga. 195, 84 S.E.2d 563 (1954), for comment, see 17 Ga. B.J. 512 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Test which determines whether a hospital is charitable</b> or otherwise is the hospital's purpose, that is, whether the hospital is maintained for gain, profit, or advantage, or not; and the question of whether a hospital is maintained for the purpose of charity or for that of profit is to be determined, in case the hospital is incorporated, not only from the hospital's powers as defined in the hospital's charter, but also from the manner in which the hospital is conducted. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Hospital is not per se a subject of charity; whether a hospital is such subject of charity depends on requirement of hospital service rendered for relief of human suffering as related to the poor, and to be free of charge where there is inability to pay. When such is the purpose and the hospital operates in pursuance of that purpose, it is a subject of charity within the meaning of the law. Taylor v. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams Hosp., 190 Ga. 349, 9 S.E.2d 165 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the finding was authorized that hospital owned and maintained by the City of Augusta, commonly known as the "University Hospital of Augusta, Georgia," and thus designated in the will in question, was a charitable institution, owned by the city and maintained primarily for the gratuitous treatment of the sick and needy of the city and county, and that by that item the testator intended the estate therein bequeathed to be applied to the promotion of the charitable objects of such hospital, the charitable bequest, being valid, would be given effect. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When residuary bequest, construed in connection with all the items of the will and the statutory law showed the intent of the testator to require hospital service free of charge to poor people who were unable to pay, the proposed hospital was a proper subject of charity within the meaning of the law, and this result was not altered because of the further intent to charge persons able to pay, since the receipts from that service were to be devoted to maintenance or improvement of the hospital, with no element of private gain. Taylor v. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams Hosp., 190 Ga. 349, 9 S.E.2d 165 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirement of compensation from patients able to pay.</b> - When a hospital can otherwise be classed as a charitable institution, the fact that patients who are able to pay are required to do so does not deprive the hospital of the hospital's charitable character. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">To establish a permanent charity for one family, and thus permit the perpetual holding together of property, which the statute against perpetuities was designed to prohibit, is not justified by the slight prospective public good that might come from educating or keeping off of the public charity rolls the poor of one family.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Purpose of Cy Pres</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of cy pres.</b> - Fundamental purpose of cy pres provisions is to allow the court to carry out the general charitable intent of the testator when this intent might otherwise be thwarted by the impossibility of the particular plan or scheme provided by the testator. Evans v. Abney, 396 U.S. 435, 90 S. Ct. 628, 24 L. Ed. 2d 634 (1970) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Applicability</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability generally.</b> - As a general rule, the doctrine of cy pres is applied in cases: (1) where there is the presence of an otherwise valid charitable grant or trust, that is, one that has charity as its purpose and sufficiently offers benefits to an indefinite public; (2) where the specific intention of the settlor may not be legally or practicably carried into effect; and (3) where there is exhibited a general charitable intent on the part of the settlor. Trammell v. Elliott, 230 Ga. 841, 199 S.E.2d 194 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>108-202 and 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When it was apparent from entire will and codicil that bequest to the governing authorities of a named association, "same being an Orphan's Home located at Macon, Georgia," was intended as a charitable trust for the benefit of orphans as a class, and that the designated "governing authorities" were merely to perform the office of trustee, the bequest was sufficiently definite and specific to be capable of execution, and since a trust will not fail for the want of a trustee, the legacy would not lapse merely because there may have been no such orphan's home and "governing authorities" as were mentioned in the will; in such case a court of equity could, by approximation, effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator in a manner most similar to that indicated by the testator. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-202 and 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a gift is made for a public charitable purpose, it is immaterial that the trustee is uncertain or incapable of taking, or that the objects of the charity are uncertain and indefinite; it will nevertheless be sustained. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-202 and 108-203).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Organization discontinuing active functions.</b> - Fact that a religious, charitable, or educational organization named as a beneficiary in a will discontinues its active functions after the execution of the will does not impair its right to take the gift so long as its identity, whether corporate or associative, continues without dissolution until the death of the testator. Crisp Area YMCA, Inc. v. NationsBank, N.A., 272 Ga. 182, 526 S.E.2d 63 (2000) (decided under former O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-113).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Cy pres will not be applied when there is demonstrated an intention of the settlor contrary to the inference of general charitable intent that the property should be applied exclusively to the purpose which is or has become impracticable or illegal. Such demonstration of a specific intent of the settlor as would result in a failure of the devise must be clear, definite, and unambiguous. In such event the trust will fail, and a resulting trust will be implied for the benefit of the testator or the testator's heirs. Trammell v. Elliott, 230 Ga. 841, 199 S.E.2d 194 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-202 and 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the accomplishment of the particular purpose and only that purpose was desired by the testator and the testator had no more general charitable intent and the testator would presumably have preferred to have the whole trust fail if the particular purpose is impossible of accomplishment, the cy pres doctrine is not applicable. Evans v. Abney, 396 U.S. 435, 90 S. Ct. 628, 24 L. Ed. 2d 634 (1970) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Cy pres doctrine improperly applied.</b> - Trial court's application of cy pres doctrine to impose a constructive trust in a corporation's favor was error under circumstances in which the decedent improperly named the corporation as a payable on death beneficiary of certificates of deposit and a trust account because, while the trial court may have been able to apply the doctrine of cy pres to as nearly as possible effectuate the decedent's intentions by, for example, allowing the decedent's charitable gift to go to some authorized entity that served much the same function as the corporation, the trial court did not do that; the trial court specifically imposed a constructive trust in favor of the corporation on the financial instruments, and this was error. Indeed, the trial court's use of cy pres in a manner that would have effectuated a payment that expressly violated the law turned the doctrine of cy pres on its head. Tuvim v. United Jewish Cmtys., Inc., 285 Ga. 632, 680 S.E.2d 827 (2009) (decided under former O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-113).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Special chancery (now equity) jurisdiction over charitable bequests</b> grows out of rule that, in cases of private right, courts will not enforce uncertainties, and that the parties at interest must be capable of definite ascertainment; but it is of the very nature of a charity that this is impossible, and from the most ancient times courts of chancery in England have applied very different rules in determining the validity of charitable bequests from the rules applied to such as were not charitable. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 108-202 and 108-203). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the framers of the Code declared the courts of chancery (now equity) to have jurisdiction to enforce charitable bequests, declared what were charities and recognized the doctrine of cy pres, the framers intended to say something more than that courts of equity could enforce trusts; there was no propriety in giving this special jurisdiction or in defining charitable purposes if a bequest for charitable purposes, to be valid, must have the same certainty and definiteness as to its objects and mode of division, as bequests, not for charitable purposes.

<p class="p4"><b>Lack of trustee will not invalidate trust.</b> - Resignation of the assignee of a trust arising under general assignments for the benefit of creditors was not a revocation of the deed of assignment. The title having passed into the trustee, the trust should not be allowed to fail for the want of a trustee. A successor will be appointed. McFerran, Shallcross &amp; Co. v. Davis, 70 Ga. 661 (1883) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When it was apparent from entire will and codicil that bequest to the governing authorities of a named association, "same being an Orphan's Home located at Macon, Georgia," was intended as a charitable trust for the benefit of orphans as a class, and that the designated "governing authorities" were merely to perform the office of trustee, the bequest was sufficiently definite and specific to be capable of execution, and since a trust will not fail for the want of a trustee, the legacy would not lapse merely because there may have been no such orphan's home and "governing authorities" as were mentioned in the will; in such case a court of equity could, by approximation, effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator in a manner most similar to that indicated by the testator. Goree v. Georgia Indus. Home, 187 Ga. 368, 200 S.E. 684 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 113-815). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the manifest intention was to create a charitable trust for tubercular children, even though the charitable institution named never existed, the purpose and object for which the trust was created still exists and the legacy does not lapse, and the cy pres doctrine applies. Creech v. Scottish Rite Hosp. for Crippled Children, 211 Ga. 195, 84 S.E.2d 563 (1954) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-102). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Nonresident trustee.</b> - Nonresident of Georgia may serve as trustee of a trust created in and to be administered in Georgia, even if the entire corpus of the trust property is located in the state. Munford v. Maclellan, 258 Ga. 679, 373 S.E.2d 368 (1988) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-13-8).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of new trustee by superior court.</b> - When a will creates a trust estate, imposing upon the executor the additional duty to hold the legal title until the death of the daughter, the trust continues until the trust is fully executed by a sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds according to the terms of the will. In such case the superior court is empowered, after the death of the executor trustee, to appoint a new trustee in the place of such deceased. Sanders v. Hinton, 171 Ga. 702, 156 S.E. 812 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3746). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When it appears without dispute that the trustee had moved the trustee's residence to the state of New York, the court did not err in directing a verdict removing the trustee as trustee and entering the court's judgment on the verdict. King v. King, 228 Ga. 818, 188 S.E.2d 502 (1972) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-315). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Probate court did not err by appointing a successor trustee pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-9-127 and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-170 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-201) as even if a corporation had not rejected the trust property, the corporation did not have the power to act as a trustee in Georgia since the corporation had not received approval from the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance to act as a trust company; a county board of commissioners was properly appointed as the successor trustee in spite of the corporation's speculation over a possible future event that might result in a conflict of interest.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Petition by beneficiaries.</b> - It matters not how large the number of beneficiaries may be; the petition of two of the beneficiaries is sufficient in this respect to bring the petition within the jurisdiction of the superior court. Sanders v. Hinton, 171 Ga. 702, 156 S.E. 812 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3746). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">All of the beneficiaries stand alike and have equal rights not only in the division of the proceeds arising from a sale of the property, but as to the forum in which the application for the appointment of a trustee should be made. The proceeding may be had as well in the county of the residence of the testator, and where the trust property is located, as in the county of the residence of the nonpetitioning beneficiaries. Sanders v. Hinton, 171 Ga. 702, 156 S.E. 812 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3746).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power and authority of superior courts to appoint new trustees</b> when the sole or surviving trustee has become disqualified in some manner cannot be exercised when the trust instrument provides the method of appointment of successors unless some reason appears that the method provided by the trust instrument cannot be followed. Devitt v. Close, 221 Ga. 853, 148 S.E.2d 316 (1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 108-315).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Filling vacancies by looking at trust instrument.</b> - Trial court had to look to trust instrument to determine how a vacancy in position of trustee was to be filled as the law directed the trial court to start there in determining how to fill that position after the settlor and a trustee died, and the two successor co-trustees resigned before the trustee died, leaving the trust unrepresented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus, a trial court was authorized to allow the trust's beneficiaries to be appointed as successor trustees as the law allowed interested parties to petition and be appointed as trustees, especially since the law did not limit the number of successor trustees it could appoint and appointment of the successor trustees was neither inconsistent with the settlor's intentions nor the interests of the beneficiaries.

<p class="p4"><b>Acts establishing acceptance.</b> - When a person as next friend filed a bill to set up equity in property and was decreed to be a trustee with the title vested in the trustee as trustee for the wife and children, this amounted to an acceptance of the trust by the trustee; and if there was no renunciation of the trust, the trustee continued to be the trustee for the children, and if the trustee failed to act when the trustee should have done so, the trustee is liable to the children for the trustee's nonaction.

<p class="p4"><b>Trustee's/executor's powers did not entitle trustee to ignore purpose of trust or commit waste.</b> - Trial court erred in concluding that a widow's considerable powers of control over two testamentary trusts as trustee and executor entitled her to summary judgment on two of the children's/beneficiaries' claims against the trust created for the purpose of supporting them during their lifetimes; she was required to diligently and in good faith ascertain whether they required support, and her powers over the assets did not entitle her to commit waste.

<p class="p4"><b>Jury instruction on standard of care.</b> - In a breach of trust action, the trial court did not apply an incorrect standard of care in that a co-trustee could only be held liable if the co-trustee failed to act in good faith because if there was any error, the error was created by the co-trustee since the co-trustee consented to the instructions given and failed to request a charge that clearly set forth what the co-trustee asserted to be the proper standard for acts performed with absolute discretion.

<p class="p4"><b>Jury question as to whether duty of good faith breached.</b> - Jury question was presented as to whether two trustees of their children's trusts acted against the interests of the beneficiaries (their children) in bad faith by amending a partnership agreement to concentrate all voting power in themselves to the exclusion of the beneficiaries, who otherwise would have become partners when they turned 45. Likewise, the trustees as partners owed duties to the trusts as partners in the partnership. Rollins v. Rollins, 338 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>No excuse from fiduciary duties.</b> - Even if a will granted expanded powers to co-executors, the co-executors were not excused from their fiduciary duties. Bloodworth v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Estate administrator had right to inspect.</b> - Order granting an estate administrator of a deceased shareholder the right to inspect the defendant's corporate books and denying the defendant's motions to compel and stay pending arbitration was affirmed because the statutes governing the transfer of stock to the estate vested ownership of the shares in the administrator of the estate and the probate court's order granted the adminstrator trustee's powers over those shares.

<p class="p4"><b>Trustee properly found to have breached fiduciary duty.</b> - It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a new trial motion brought by a trustee who was found to have breached the trustee's fiduciary duty to trust beneficiaries by making distributions to a co-trustee under a trust's encroachment provision because the trustee breached the trustee's duty to protect the trust corpus as: (1) the trustee inconsistently required the co-trustee to provide supporting evidence for corpus distributions and let the co-trustee exceed an allotted budget; and (2) the beneficiaries were damaged by the resulting reduction in trust corpus. Reliance Trust Co. v. Candler, 315 Ga. App. 495, 726 S.E.2d 636 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach of trust issue for jury.</b> - In a trust beneficiary's action against a co-trustee and others, issues of fact remained as to the beneficiary's claims for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of a trust asset for less than fair market value and failure to account for a commission owed on the sale, rendering summary judgment on these claims improper. Kahn v. Britt, 330 Ga. App. 377, 765 S.E.2d 446 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a beneficiary's claims against a trustee and the trust's attorneys, issues of fact remained as to the trustee's and attorneys' duties surrounding the sale of the trust's cattle ranch at auction because no appraisal was done, the sale was only run for seven weeks, the trustee believed the land was worth more than the price obtained, and the trustee failed to consider a commission due to a real estate agent. Kahn v. Britt, 330 Ga. App. 377, 765 S.E.2d 446 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of trust asset to a co-trustee through a straw man.</b> - Because there were genuine issues as to whether trustees fraudulently concealed their breach of fiduciary duty in selling the principal trust asset to a co-trustee at a discount through a straw man in 1979, tolling the statute of limitations, and whether the beneficiaries exercised diligence in discovering the fraud, summary judgment was improper.

<p class="p4"><b>Relief generally.</b> - When, in a divorce case, the jury clearly intended to create a trust for the purpose of providing support for the minor child during the child's minority and also intended that there be monthly payments from the trust for the use of the child, but the husband failed to take any substantive steps to set up the trust, there was no error in the trial court naming a trustee and effectuating the trust by requiring the husband to make the payments necessary to uphold the husband's share of the debts, encumbrances, and maintenance of the trust property. Aycock v. Aycock, 251 Ga. 104, 303 S.E.2d 456 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-6). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Town of Douglasville v. Mobley, 169 Ga. 53, 149 S.E. 575 (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4587). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Richmond County, 174 Ga. 599, 163 S.E. 482 (1932), later appeal, United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v.

<p class="p4"><b>As regards establishment of debt due by estate, defendant legatees stand in place of executor.</b> Thus, the action is not governed by the limitations in reference to actions for money had and received or unjust enrichment, but by the limitations to actions on the character of the claim against the estate.

<p class="p4"><b>When person dies owing debt,</b> the person's creditor may in equity follow assets left by such person in hands of distributee, and when the assets received by the distributee are sufficient to pay the debt, the creditors may obtain a personal judgment against the distributee for the amount of debt.

<p class="p4"><b>Notice generally.</b> - If a bank actively aids the trustee in misappropriating the fund, and especially if the bank participates in the misappropriation and receives the fruits of such misappropriation by obtaining payment of a debt due the bank by the trustee in one's individual capacity, the bank would be liable to the true owners of the fund for the amount thus wrongfully appropriated by the bank to the bank's own uses. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

<p class="p4">When a trustee deposits money in a bank, the bank has a right to assume that the money so deposited will be applied by the trustee to the proper purposes under the trust; and, acting under this assumption, the bank may lawfully pay the checks drawn by the person depositing the money, whether signed in one's representative capacity or not.

<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's fees.</b> - When a bank was liable to the beneficiaries of a trust for breach of fiduciary duty for not investing the trust's assets in treasury bills, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-193 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-302) did not require the trial court to award or even consider awarding attorney's fees to the beneficiaries because no bad faith was shown. Wachovia Bank of Ga., N.A. v. Namik, 275 Ga. App. 229, 620 S.E.2d 470 (2005) (decided under former O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-193). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because no verdict form presented the jury with the question of whether the siblings who sold their deceased mother's farm to another sibling had breached a fiduciary duty, a trial court erred in granting attorney's fees to the other siblings who sued over the purchase, as an award of fees under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-193 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-302) required a finding of a breach of trust; fraud, as only one of the potential theories that was sued upon, could have been found by the jury without finding that there was also a breach of trust. Bloodworth v. Bloodworth, 277 Ga. App. 387, 626 S.E.2d 589 (2006) (decided under former O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-193). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Davis v. Walker, 288 Ga. App. 820, 655 S.E.2d 634 (2007) (decided under former O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-193). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Personal representative wrongfully tried to have the estate's primary asset, a house, conveyed to the personal representative. As the beneficiary's petition for the personal representative's removal was premised on the latter's breach of fiduciary duty, under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-193 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-302), the beneficiary was properly awarded appellate expenses, including attorney fees, incurred in defending the appeals of that removal.

<p class="p4">Even assuming that the trustee admitted to multiple breaches of the trustee's fiduciary duties as trustee during an evidentiary hearing and an interim award of attorney fees was an equitable sanction for the trustee's misconduct, such fees could not be awarded because there had not been a judgment in the son's favor on the merits of the son's breach-of-trust claim.

<p class="p4"><b>Compensatory damages for lost rent.</b> - Personal representative's wrongful conveyance of the estate's primary asset, a house, to the personal representative was a breach of fiduciary duty. The beneficiary's evidence of the house's rental value authorized the award to the beneficiary of compensatory damages for lost rent under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-54 and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-193 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-302).

<p class="p4"><b>General and punitive damages awarded.</b> - Personal representative's wrongful conveyance of the estate's primary asset, a house, to the personal representative was both a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud entitling the beneficiary to general and punitive damages.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Issue of fact as to whether trustees fraudulently concealed their breach of duty.</b> - Because there were genuine issues as to whether the trustees fraudulently concealed the trustees' breach of fiduciary duty in selling the principal trust asset to a co-trustee at a discount through a straw man in 1979, tolling the statute of limitations, and whether the beneficiaries exercised diligence in discovering the fraud, summary judgment was improper. Smith v. SunTrust Bank, 325 Ga. App. 531, 754 S.E.2d 117 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cause of action not barred by statute of limitations.</b> - Trial court erred in ruling that son's 1999 breach of trust action against the parents as trustees was barred by six-year statute of limitations under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-198 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-307), as the son's allegations as to the parents' refusal to loan money for undergraduate work in 1986 did not allege a violation of the trust, and the 1991 allegations that the parents were not personally spending the trust fund did not result in the conclusion that the trustees breached the trust in 1991. Snuggs v. Snuggs, 275 Ga. 647, 571 S.E.2d 800 (2002) (decided under former O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-198). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the employer's action to recover for theft of corporate funds, the employee was not entitled to summary judgment since the six-year statute of limitations applicable to constructive trust claims only barred the employer's action as to some, but not all, of the employee's thefts. Total Supply, Inc. v. Pridgen, 267 Ga. App. 125, 598 S.E.2d 805 (2004) (decided under former O.C.G.A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-198). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Beneficiaries' breach of fiduciary duty claim against the trustee of a family trust was time-barred because: (1) the statute began to run when the trustee entered into a loan transaction that allegedly harmed the trust; (2) the beneficiaries did not show the trustee withheld information from the beneficiaries, deterred the beneficiaries from hiring the beneficiaries' own advisor to review the loan, or deterred the beneficiaries from timely filing suit; and (3) the beneficiaries raised no fact issue as to whether the beneficiaries used diligence to discover any fraud that would toll the statute. Mayfield v. Heiman, 317 Ga. App. 322, 730 S.E.2d 685 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retroactive applicability of statute of limitations.</b> - Revised Georgia Trust Code's provisions apply to any trust irrespective of the date the trust was created, with two exceptions: to the extent it would impair vested rights, and except as otherwise provided by law. There is no vested right in a statute of limitation, and to the extent that Mayfield v. Heiman, 317 Ga. App. 322,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(2012), suggests that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-307(a) does not apply retroactively, that suggestion is non-binding dicta. Smith v. SunTrust Bank, 325 Ga. App. 531, 754 S.E.2d 117 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suit against trustee governed by six year limitations period, not two year.</b> - Because the letter to a trustee from the trustee's accountants was simply a form of general correspondence that did not contain the type of detailed information contemplated by the Georgia General Assembly for the letter to qualify as a report, the letter was not a report for purposes of the Trust Code, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-307; therefore, a beneficiary's cause of action against the trustee was not subject to the two-year statute of limitations but, rather, the six-year statute of limitations applied. Hasty v. Castleberry, 293 Ga. 727, 749 S.E.2d 676 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claims barred by two-year limitations period.</b> - Trustee was entitled to summary judgment in a breach of trust suit because the plaintiffs' claims that accrued more than two years before the filing of their lawsuit were barred by the two-year statute of limitation under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-307(a) as the uncontroverted evidence showed that the trustee sent detailed trust statements to the plaintiffs on a quarterly, yearly, and sometimes monthly basis until the trust was exhausted, which sufficiently put the plaintiffs on notice of any claim.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Civil Code 1872, <span class="s1">§</span> 3377, former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3203, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-154, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-199 of the 1991 Trust Act are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trustee shall not incur any individual or personal liability</b> in such action. On the contrary, the statute expressly declares: "The judgment thus rendered shall impose no personal liability on the trustee," etc. It will therefore be seen that one is a mere nominal party, so far as personal interest in the action is concerned, charged with the duty of defending the action, not in one's own behalf, but on behalf of the cestuis que trust. If one fails properly to discharge this duty, one is liable to them in damages. Wagnon v. Pease, 104 Ga. 417, 30 S.E. 895 (1898) (decided under former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 3203).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitation of liability proper.</b> - In an action by beneficiaries of a trust to recover on a promissory note, the trial court did not err in limiting their potential counterclaim liability to the amount the beneficiaries would otherwise have received as trust beneficiaries since the beneficiaries could not be held personally liable in an action against the trust. Altama Delta Corp. v. Howell, 225 Ga. App. 78, 483 S.E.2d 127 (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-199).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insurer's duty to defend.</b> - Insurer did not have a duty to defend a trustee as the real estate at issue was conveyed to the purchasers by another individual acting as attorney-in-fact for the trustee in the trustee's role as trustee, and the trustee did not allege the trustee had any interaction with the purchasers that would have created personal liability under state law, former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-199 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-308).
