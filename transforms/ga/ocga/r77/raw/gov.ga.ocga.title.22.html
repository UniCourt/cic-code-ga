</b></p>
<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The right of eminent domain is the right of this state, through its regular organization, to reassert, either temporarily or permanently, its dominion over any portion of the soil of this state on account of public exigency and for the public good. Thus, in time of war or insurrection the proper authorities may possess and hold any part of the territory of this state for the common safety. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, except as provided in Code Section 22-1-15, neither this state nor any political subdivision thereof nor any other condemning authority shall use eminent domain unless it is for public use. Public use is a matter of law to be determined by the court and the condemnor bears the burden of proof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as provided in Code Section 22-1-15, no condemnation shall be converted to any use other than a public use for 20 years from the initial condemnation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as provided in Code Section 22-1-15, if property acquired through the power of eminent domain from an owner fails to be put to a public use within five years, the former property owner may apply to the condemnor or its successor or assign for reconveyance or quitclaim of the property to the former property owner or for additional compensation for such property. For purposes of this subsection, property shall be considered to have been put to a public use at the point in time when substantial good faith effort has been expended on a project to put the property to public use, notwithstanding the fact that the project may not have been completed. The application shall be in writing, and the condemnor or its successor or assign shall act on the application within 60 days by: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) Executing a reconveyance or quitclaim of the property upon receipt of compensation not to exceed the amount of the compensation paid by the condemnor at the time of acquisition; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) Paying additional compensation to the former owner of the property, such compensation to be calculated by subtracting the price paid by the condemnor for the property at the time of acquisition from the fair market value of the property at the time the application is filed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) If the condemnor fails to take either action within 60 days, the former property owner may, within the next 90 days following, initiate an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located to reacquire the property or receive additional compensation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) The condemnor shall provide notice to each former owner of the property prior to acquisition if the condemnor fails to put such property to a public use within five years. The condemnee shall have one year from the date notice is received to bring an application under this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When property is acquired from more than one owner for the same public use and reconveyance or additional compensation to a single owner is impracticable, any party to the original condemnation or each person with a legal claim in such condemnation may file an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located for an equitable resolution. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Taking property for public use is legislative, not judicial, function.</b> - The necessity or expediency of appropriating particular property for public use is not a matter of judicial cognizance, but one for the determination of the legislative branch of the government, and this must obviously be so when the state takes for the state's own purposes. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, 219 Ga. 800, 136 S.E.2d 334 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice to owner not required before determination of necessity.</b> - Since the necessity for taking private property for a public use is a legislative and not a judicial function, due process does not require notice to the owner nor an opportunity to be heard before such determination can be made. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, 219 Ga. 800, 136 S.E.2d 334 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Eminent domain statutes to be strictly construed.</b> - Since the power to take private property for a public use or benefit is in derogation of the right of the citizen, statutes under which it is claimed must be strictly construed, and it is generally held that the power is not conferred unless an intention to that effect appears in clear and express terms, or by necessary implication. Botts v. Southeastern Pipe-Line Co., 190 Ga. 689, 10 S.E.2d 375 (1940), commented on in 3 Ga. B.J. 49 (1941). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The exercise of the right of eminent domain is a legislative function, and the powers delegated by the General Assembly thereunder must be exercised in strict conformity with the statute. DOT v. Worley, 150 Ga. App. 768, 258 S.E.2d 595, aff'd and modified on other grounds, 244 Ga. 783, 263 S.E.2d 436 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>No right to take land for private use.</b> - The power of eminent domain may never be used to acquire property to be used by private individuals solely for private use and private gain.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Right rests largely in discretion of exercising authority.</b> - In the absence of bad faith the exercise of the right of eminent domain rests largely in the discretion of the authority exercising such right, both as to necessity and amount. City of Atlanta v. First Nat'l Bank, 154 Ga. App. 658, 269 S.E.2d 878 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Substituted condemnation.</b> - When property is condemned for exchange with another public utility, and the property will be used for a public purpose, this is called "substituted condemnation," and this is a valid exercise of the condemnor's power of eminent domain. City of Atlanta v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 144 Ga. App. 157, 240 S.E.2d 730 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Cessation of work on project after notifying property owner of possible condemnation.</b> - After the Department of Transportation informed a corporation in the spring of 1981 that a building leased by the corporation would be condemned for highway purposes, but later all work on the proposed highway, including all condemnation actions in progress, was halted, and the corporation sought to recover from the department the corporation's loss of an advantageous leasehold interest, as well as expenses involved in moving, since the corporation had been advised that no move was required before September 1982, and that written notification would precede a required removal, the corporation's<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>decision to move in August 1982 was by voluntary choice, and could not be attributed to an interference by the department with the corporation's exclusive rights of ownership, use and enjoyment. Hence, whether the corporation's action was characterized as direct or inverse condemnation, the losses claimed did not result from an exercise of eminent domain. Josh Cabaret, Inc. v.

<p class="p6"><b>Taking property for public use is legislative, not judicial, function.</b> - The necessity or expediency of appropriating particular property for public use is not a matter of judicial cognizance, but one for the determination of the legislative branch of the government, and this must obviously be so when the state takes for the state's own purposes.

<p class="p6"><b>Notice to owner not required before determination of necessity.</b> - Since the necessity for taking private property for a public use is a legislative and not a judicial function, due process does not require notice to the owner nor an opportunity to be heard before such determination can be made.

<p class="p6"><b>Eminent domain statutes to be strictly construed.</b> - Since the power to take private property for a public use or benefit is in derogation of the right of the citizen, statutes under which it is claimed must be strictly construed, and it is generally held that the power is not conferred unless an intention to that effect appears in clear and express terms, or by necessary implication.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Eminent domain statutes must be strictly construed.</b> - The taking or injuring of private property for the public benefit is the exercise of a high power, and all the conditions and limitations provided by law, under which it may be done, should be closely followed. Too much caution in this respect cannot be observed to prevent abuse and oppression. Thomas v. City of Cairo, 206 Ga. 336, 57 S.E.2d 192 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Private property cannot be taken for public uses, except under the forms and by due course of law. Thomas v. City of Cairo, 206 Ga. 336, 57 S.E.2d 192 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Owner entitled to compensation as of date of taking.</b> - When private property is condemned for public use the owner is entitled to receive just and adequate compensation as of the date of the taking and not as of the date of the announcement of the taking, and the value of the property should be fixed at the time of its taking. R.E. Adams Properties, Inc. v. City of Gainesville, 125 Ga. App. 800, 189 S.E.2d 114 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Taking includes interference with rights incident to property.</b> - A taking of property for which compensation must be first paid does not require an actual physical taking, but may consist in an interference with the rights of ownership, use and enjoyment, or any other right incident to property. Woodside v. City of Atlanta, 214 Ga. 75, 103 S.E.2d 108 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>"Unique" property.</b> - Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" when fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when the properties are not of a type generally bought or sold in the open market.

<p class="p6">When the business belongs to a separate lessee, the lessee may recover for business losses as an element of compensation separate from the value of the land whether the destruction of the business is total or merely partial, provided only that the loss is not remote or speculative. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., 245 Ga. 314, 265 S.E.2d 10 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In a condemnation case, the fact that the owner of the condemned land had ceased the operation of a rendering plant located on the land by the time of trial did not preclude the recovery of business loss damages. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., 274 Ga. App. 353, 617 S.E.2d 612 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Award of business loss damages was proper for the condemnation of land on which a rendering plant was located because the loss was not speculative: the plant was established and plants engaged in the rendering business were not generally bought and sold on the open market, making it unique. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., 274 Ga. App. 353, 617 S.E.2d 612 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Application of law existing on date of appeal to case already tried.</b> - Owners in condemnation cases have vested rights to just and adequate compensation which cannot be destroyed by applying the law existing as of the date of the appeal to a case that has already been tried. Dot v. Worley, 150 Ga. App. 768, 258 S.E.2d 436, aff'd and modified on other grounds, 244 Ga. 783, 263 S.E.2d 436 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Limitations on action for interference with right of access.</b> - The property owner whose right of access is damaged by public improvements to the streets either by obstructing or cutting off completely access or travel in a particular direction may maintain an action only when the interference is at or within the first intersecting block from the owner's property. Decatur County v. Settles, 107 Ga. App. 150, 129 S.E.2d 212 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The Department of Transportation is not required to condemn or pay for, as a separate and additional item of damage, the taking of a nonexistent property right, the "right of access" to a limited-access highway, except where an old highway is included therein. State Hwy. Dep't v. Kinsey, 131 Ga. App. 770, 206 S.E.2d 835 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Insufficient compliance with O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>22-1-9. - In a condemnation action, the court vacated the trial court's order adopting the special master's return as to the property value because none of the city's offers prior to 2014 satisfied the dictates of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-1-9(3) and the city took several years to comply with <span class="s1">§</span> 22-1-9(3), which bore on the issue of whether the city acted in bad faith, which required further consideration by the trial court. Summerour v. City of Marietta, 338 Ga. App. 259, 788 S.E.2d 921 (2016), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 302 Ga. 645, 807 S.E.2d 324 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Cessation of work on project after notifying property owner of possible condemnation.</b> - After the Department of Transportation informed a corporation in the spring of 1981 that a building leased by the corporation would be condemned for highway purposes, but later all work on the proposed highway, including all condemnation actions in progress, was halted, and the corporation sought to recover from the department the corporation's loss of an advantageous leasehold interest, as well as expenses involved in moving, since the corporation had been advised that no move was required before September 1982, and that written notification would precede a required removal, the corporation's decision to move in August 1982, was by voluntary choice, and could not be attributed to an interference by the department with the corporation's exclusive rights of ownership, use and enjoyment. Hence, whether the corporation's action was characterized as direct or inverse condemnation, the losses claimed did not result from an exercise of eminent domain. Josh Cabaret, Inc. v. DOT, 256 Ga. 749, 353 S.E.2d 346 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Eminent domain statutes must be strictly construed.</b> - The taking or injuring of private property for the public benefit is the exercise of a high power, and all the conditions and limitations provided by law, under which it may be done, should be closely followed. Too much caution in this respect cannot be observed to prevent abuse and oppression. Thomas v. City of Cairo, 206 Ga. 336, 57 S.E.2d 192 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Austin v. Augusta Term. Ry., 108 Ga. 671, 34 S.E. 852, 47 L.R.A. 755 (1899).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Sales of similar property as evidence of value.</b> - On a question in regard to the value of land sought to be condemned, it is competent to introduce evidence of sales of property similar to that in question, made at or near the time of the taking. The exact limit either of similarity or difference or of nearness or remoteness in point of time is difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe by any arbitrary rule, but must to a large extent depend on the location and the character of the property and the circumstances of the case; it is to be considered with reference to throwing light on the issue, and not as a mere method of raising a legal puzzle.

<p class="p6">Trial court did not err in denying the property owners' motion to dismiss the condemnation petition, nor in overruling the owners' exception to the special master's award, because the evidence at the special master hearing showed that the telecommunications condemnor made an effort to agree on a purchase price for the property, but that those negotiations ultimately failed, which was sufficient to show that the condemnor could not procure the property by contract within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-1-6.

<p class="p8"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Damages measured by fair market value of property.</b> - Ordinarily, when an entire parcel of property is taken, or an entire leasehold interest is taken, the measure of the damages is the "market value" of the land or leasehold interest as the case might be; market value has been defined as the price which may be paid by one wishing but not required to buy, to one wishing but not required to sell. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Owner's recovery not restricted to market value.</b> - The constitutional and statutory provisions as to just and adequate compensation do not necessarily restrict the owner's recovery to market value; the owner is entitled to the value of the property to the owner, not the property's value to the state. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Fair and reasonable value of property as measure of damages.</b> - The measure of damages for property taken by the right of eminent domain, being compensatory in its nature, is the pecuniary loss sustained by the owner, taking into consideration all relevant factors; this loss may be represented by the fair and reasonable value of the property taken if the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Costs of removing personal or business property from real estate.</b> - The cost of moving personal property from real estate which is taken for public purposes cannot be considered as an element of damage, as such; however, the cost of removal of either fixtures, buildings, or personalty, especially when used for business purposes, may be considered as one of the factors entering into a determination of the value of the real estate to the condemnee from whom it is taken. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Reimbursement of utility companies relocated due to interstate highway construction.</b> - Utility companies whose facilities must be relocated or reconstructed by reason of the construction of any segment of the Interstate Highway System must be reimbursed therefor. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 184.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</b></p>
<p class="p5">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">In order to encourage and expedite the acquisition of real property by agreements with owners, to avoid litigation and relieve congestion in the courts, to assure consistent treatment for property owners, and to promote public confidence in land acquisition practices, all condemnations and potential condemnations shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be guided by the following policies and practices:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11">(1) The condemning authority shall make every reasonable effort to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Where the condemning authority seeks to obtain a fee simple interest in real property, real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his or her designated representatives shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his or her inspection of the property, except that the condemning authority may, by law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, prescribe a procedure to waive the appraisal in cases involving the acquisition by sale or donation of property with a low fair market value; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) Before the initiation of negotiations for fee simple interest for real property, the condemning authority shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. In no event shall such amount be less than the condemning authority's independent appraisal of the fair market value of such property. The condemning authority shall provide the owner of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount it established as just compensation. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated. The condemning authority shall consider alternative sites suggested by the owner of the property as part of the compensation offered; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the condemning authority pays the agreed purchase price or deposits with the court in accordance with this title, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the condemning authority's appraisal of the fair market value of such property or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for such property; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(5) The construction or development of a project for public use shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling or to move his or her business or farm operation without at least 90 days' written notice from the condemning authority of the date by which such move is required; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(6) If the condemning authority permits an owner or tenant to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination by the condemning authority on short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(7) In no event shall the condemnor act in bad faith in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(8) If any legal interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, the condemning authority shall institute formal condemnation proceedings. No condemnor shall intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his or her real property; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(9) A person whose real property is being acquired in accordance with this title may, after the person has been fully informed of his or her right to receive just compensation for such property, donate such property, any part thereof, any legal interest therein, or any compensation paid to a condemning authority, as such person shall determine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">City seeking to acquire a landowner's property violated O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-1-9(3) because the city failed to disclose the appraisal summary to the owner in a timely manner as required by the statute, instead sending the summary ten months after the summary was requested by the owner; the statute was mandatory, and dismissal of the condemnation petition was the proper remedy.

<p class="p6"><b>Public necessity established for condemnation.</b> - Record supported that the condemnation of the buffer property would serve a public purpose and that the county did not act in bad faith because failing to disclose the extent of methane migration provided no financial benefit for the county since at no time did the county discount the price the county was offering the property owner for the buffer property due to ignorance of the status of methane migration.

<p class="p8"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Only public necessity can justify taking of private property.</b> - The right of the humblest individual in the enjoyment of the individual's property must be protected. The right to take private property from the owner for public use often works extreme hardship and savors of oppression. Nothing but a public necessity can justify it, and then only in strict conformity with the law. Williams v. City of La Grange, 213 Ga. 241, 98 S.E.2d 617 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnor chooses its method of procedure,</b> and it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. The property owner is also bound, although he did not choose the method of procedure. Johnson v. Fulton County, 103 Ga. App. 873, 121 S.E.2d 54 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Amendment of notice of condemnation proceedings is perfectly proper</b> when the amendment's allowance does not adversely and substantially affect the condemnee's rights. Taylor v. Georgia Power Co., 129 Ga. App. 89, 198 S.E.2d 701 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnor has burden of proving land value and consequential damages.</b> - The burden of proof to show the value of the land taken and the consequential damages to the remaining property, if any, is on the condemnor. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, 111 Ga. App. 292, 141 S.E.2d 590 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sole question for assessors or jury is amount of compensation.</b> - When proceedings are instituted for the purpose of acquiring property for public purposes, the sole question which may be passed upon by the appointed assessors, or by a jury on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid to one whose property is being taken by the condemning authorities. Since the legislature has not expressly provided any method whereby the property owner can contest the question of public necessity or the right of condemnation, the property owner is left without a legal remedy and must resort to an independent action in a court of equity for relief. Williams v. City of La Grange, 213 Ga. 241, 98 S.E.2d 617 (1957); B. &amp; W. Hen Farm, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., 222 Ga. 830, 152 S.E.2d 841 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The sole power of the assessors relates to the value of the property taken and to no other question. City of Carrollton v. Walker, 215 Ga. 505, 111 S.E.2d 79 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In condemnation cases, the sole question for the consideration of the jury, upon an appeal from an award of the assessors or from an award of a special master, is the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee for the property taken under the condemnation proceeding and the amount of damages to the remaining property of the condemnee, if any. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, 111 Ga. App. 292, 141 S.E.2d 590 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Appeal from award of assessors is de novo investigation,</b> and the defendant in such proceedings may file an appropriate legal defense thereto. City of Macon v. Ries, 179 Ga. 320, 176 S.E. 21 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">An appeal from the award of assessors in a condemnation proceeding is a de novo investigation, and the defendant may file appropriate pleadings and defenses therein as in other suits. Georgia Power Co. v. Lightfoot, 97 Ga. App. 330, 103 S.E.2d 99 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Law does not provide for intervention by any person claiming interest in property,</b> whether or not such person was served with notice. Mitchell v. State Hwy. Dep't, 216 Ga. 517, 118 S.E.2d 88 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statutory construction when procedural provisions incomplete.</b> - When wording is taken from a prior statute, or when the law fails to be complete within itself, then reference to provisions for proceedings before assessors is permitted to fill in the void. Johnson v. Fulton County, 103 Ga. App. 873, 121 S.E.2d 54 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Contesting validity of condemnation proceedings.</b> - When a property owner participates in proceedings but refuses to take the award of the assessors, and when the property owner acted promptly after the award of the assessors was made by filing the owner's petition in equity, alleging that the condemnor was proceeding illegally and had no right to condemn, and sought to enjoin the entering upon or taking possession of the owner's property, the property owner is not estopped from contesting the validity of the condemnation proceedings. Johnston v. Clayton County Water Auth., 222 Ga. 39, 148 S.E.2d 417 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Department of Transportation may not condemn municipally owned property</b> as the legislature has not clearly granted such authority or created a procedure therefore, and as such grant may not be implied from statutory provisions generally establishing a procedure for state agencies to condemn "private property." DOT v. City of Atlanta, 255 Ga. 124, 337 S.E.2d 327 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnation for transportation purposes.</b> - Even though the title to property to be condemned for transportation purposes was not in question, a city could choose to use procedures set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 32-3-4 and, although it could have done so, was not required to use the procedures set forth in these condemnation statutes.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnation procedures provide method to be followed when private property is taken or damaged for public purposes,</b> and the procedure herein prescribed cannot be adopted when the property is sought to be taken for a purely private purpose.

Marietta Chair Co. v. Henderson, 121 Ga. 399, 49 S.E. 312, 104 Am. St. R. 156, 2 Ann. Cas. 83 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Prior laws are superseded.</b> - All prior laws providing different method of procedure for taking property under the power of eminent domain are superseded by the condemnation procedure. Alexander v. City Council, 134 Ga. 849, 68 S.E. 704 (1910); Bibb Brick Co. v. Central of Ga. Ry., 151 Ga. 83, 105 S.E. 833 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Power granted by charter not affected.</b> - The power granted the Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Company to condemn private property in the manner prescribed in its original charter as amended by the Act approved December 26, 1836 (Prince's Dig. 358), could not legally be, and was not affected by the passage of the condemnation laws. Gardner v. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking Co., 117 Ga. 522, 43 S.E. 863 (1903) (decided prior to enactment of <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-121).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Power delegated to municipality.</b> - If the power of eminent domain is conferred on the municipality by its charter, and no provision is made therein for its exercise, the general law embodied in the condemnation law is by implication a part of the law delegating the power. Stowe v. Town of Newborn, 127 Ga. 421, 56 S.E. 516 (1907). See Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking Co. v. Mayor of Union Point, 119 Ga. 809, 47 S.E. 183 (1904); Zachry v.

L. 1894, p. 95) and by operation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-1-8. DOT v. City of Atlanta, 255 Ga. 124, 337 S.E.2d 327 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>State property not subject to condemnation.</b> - Statutes providing for condemnation of land for public use do not provide that the statutes shall apply to the state, nor is there anything to imply that the legislature intended such statutes to be applicable to the sovereign. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Western &amp; A.R.R., 142 Ga. 532, 83 S.E. 135 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Consent of property owner not necessary.</b> - In condemnation proceedings, the willingness or unwillingness of the property owner to part with the owner's property is not a subject matter of consideration.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Contesting validity of condemnation proceedings.</b> - When a property owner participates in proceedings but refuses to take the award of the assessors, and when the property owner acted promptly after the award of the assessors was made by filing the owner's petition in equity, alleging that the condemnor was proceeding illegally and had no right to condemn, and sought to enjoin the entering upon or taking possession of the owner's property, the property owner is not estopped from contesting the validity of the condemnation proceedings. Johnston v. Clayton County Water Auth., 222 Ga. 39, 148 S.E.2d 417 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statutory construction when procedural provisions incomplete.</b> - When wording is taken from a prior statute, or when Ga. L. 1957, p. 387, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-100 et seq.) fails to be complete within itself, then reference to provisions for proceedings before assessors is permitted to fill in the void.

<p class="p6"><b>Owner entitled to compensation for land taken and for damage to remaining land.</b> - When a county, in the exercise of the county's corporate powers, appropriates land of an individual, and as a result the premises of the owner are rendered less valuable, the individual is entitled to just compensation for the land so taken, and also for the injury thus sustained. Terrell County v. York, 127 Ga. 166, 56 S.E. 309 (1906). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In condemnation proceedings, the condemnor is liable not only for direct damages for the actual land taken for the public use, but in addition thereto for all consequential damages which naturally and proximately flow from the taking of the land to the remainder of the parcel or tract of land not taken as tend to diminish the property's market value. Georgia Power Co. v. McCrea, 46 Ga. App. 279, 167 S.E. 542 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There are only two elements of damages to be considered in a condemnation proceeding: first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of the property to the purposes for which the property is condemned. Simon v. Department of Transp., 245 Ga. 478, 265 S.E.2d 777 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">The uses which may be considered in determining damages must be so reasonably probable as to have an effect on the present market value of the land; a purely imaginative or speculative value cannot be considered.

<p class="p6"><b>Definition of market value of property.</b> - Market value of property is what the property will bring when sold for cash by a person ready and willing to sell, but under no obligation to sell, and when bought by a person ready and willing to buy, but under no obligation to buy.

<p class="p6"><b>Evidence of factors which owner would present to prospective buyer properly admitted.</b> - In determining market value of land taken or damaged in an eminent domain proceeding, it is proper for the trial court to admit proof of all factors which an owner could reasonably urge upon a prospective purchaser which could tend to favorably influence the person.

<p class="p6"><b>Evidence of property's highest and best use as convenience store properly admitted.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying motion to strike the testimony of condemnee's expert witness that the condemned property's highest and best use would be as a convenience store because of the property's location in relation to nearby industry and residential development since the testimony was based on relevant facts concerning existing local population and industry.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Instructions.</b> - Although charge restricting jury, in determining value of property, to uses which may be lawfully made of the property at time of taking as set out in zoning ordinances then in effect was incorrect, there was no harm since the condemned property was zoned for industrial use at the time of taking and the appellant contended that the property's highest and best use was industrial. McDaniel Enters., Inc. v. Gwinnett County, 162 Ga. App. 419, 291 S.E.2d 738 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Instruction that the mere possibility that land might be used for a certain purpose is not enough to authorize a jury to consider the effect of such a possibility in determining the value of land. At least a reasonable probability must be shown by competent evidence to authorize consideration of such a prospective use in determining value. Elliott v.

<p class="p8"><b>2. Value for All Purposes</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Prospective value of land for any purpose may be considered.</b> - In arriving at the value of the land taken under condemnation proceedings, the value of the land, including the land's prospective value for any purpose, may be considered. Georgia Power Co. v. Carson, 46 Ga. App. 612, 167 S.E. 902 (1933); State Hwy. Bd. v. Coleman, 78 Ga. App. 54, 50 S.E.2d 262 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">All elements and uses of the land may be taken into consideration to determine the market value of the land taken and the consequential damages to the land not taken. However, under this sort of procedure, a witness may not be permitted to testify separately as to the value of each element. Southern Ry. v. Miller, 94 Ga. App. 701, 96 S.E.2d 297 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Including value for specific use for which condemnor takes land.</b> - The availability of property for the specific use for which the property was taken and to which the property is put by the condemnor is an element to be considered in estimating the value to the owner for all purposes for which the property is available. State Hwy. Bd. v. Shierling, 51 Ga. App. 935, 181 S.E. 885 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Regardless of probability that other uses will be made of land.</b> - This section clearly states that the suitability of land for other uses, and not the probability that other uses will be made of the land, is the criterion for estimating the value of condemned land. Moore v. State Hwy. Dep't, 221 Ga. 392, 144 S.E.2d 747 (1965); State Hwy. Dep't v. Howard, 119 Ga. App. 298, 167 S.E.2d 177 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The test for estimating the value of land under this section is whether the land sought to be condemned could be used for other purposes, and not whether the land would be used for other purposes. Schoolcraft v. DeKalb County, 126 Ga. App. 101, 189 S.E.2d 915 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The test is whether the land is legitimately usable for other purposes, not whether such use is certain. Possible future uses will not influence the present market value of a tract unless there is a demand for such uses or those uses are otherwise reasonably probable. Georgia Power Co. v. Cole, 141 Ga. App. 806, 234 S.E.2d 382 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Charge on theory of reasonable probable use in a condemnation proceeding</b> was erroneous because it allowed the jury to determine the value of the land on the date of the taking without ascribing any value to subterranean limestone deposits. Gunn v. DOT, 222 Ga. App. 684, 476 S.E.2d 46 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Use of charge allowing consideration of other uses of land.</b> - Absent any evidence authorizing the jury to find that property being condemned was suitable for other uses or from which the jury might reasonably infer the property's suitability for other uses, a charge that the jury might, in estimating the property's fair market value, consider other uses to which the property might be devoted was error. State Hwy. Dep't v. Whitehurst, 109 Ga. App. 737, 137 S.E.2d 371 (1964), later appeal, 112 Ga. App. 877, 146 S.E.2d 919 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Evidence insufficient to require charge on valuation for all purposes.</b> - When 3.673 acres of a 40-acre tract of land plus a small drainage area was being condemned by the state highway department, evidence that all of the 40 acres, except about two acres where the owner's home stood, was in improved pasture, and part of the land taken was a narrow strip along a road on which the dwelling house of the owner faced, does not authorize an inference that the land taken was suitable for purposes other than agricultural so as to authorize a charge based on subsection (d) of this section. State Hwy. Dep't v. Cronic, 114 Ga. App. 348, 151 S.E.2d 486 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to give instruction on valuation for all purposes held erroneous.</b> - When there is some testimony that the condemned land is residential property and that there is an apartment complex and commercial property in the immediate vicinity it is error to refuse to give an instruction on valuation of the property for all purposes when requested in writing. Schoolcraft v. DeKalb County, 126 Ga. App. 101, 189 S.E.2d 915 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There being evidence from which the jury would be authorized to conclude that the property in question has reasonable potential for a use other than for that to which the property is presently being put, it is error to refuse to give the following written request to charge: "In the estimation of value of land taken for public uses, it is not restricted to its agricultural or productive qualities, but inquiry may be made as to all other legitimate purposes to which the property could be appropriated. The test in such cases is whether the land could be used for other purposes, not whether the land would be used for other purposes." DOT v. Katz, 169 Ga.

<p class="p8"><b>3. Unique Property</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>"Unique property" defined.</b> - Unique property is simply property which must be valued by something other than the fair market value standard because there is no general market for such property. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, 165 Ga. App. 348, 299 S.E.2d 594 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Unique value is pecuniary value of certain property to the property's present owner,</b> in a situation when the owner can find no other property equally well suited to the owner's use, and there is no taker on the open market at the pecuniary value of the property to the owner. In such a case there is no market value, which presupposes a willing-buyer willing-seller situation. Housing Auth. v. Troncalli, 111 Ga. App. 515, 142 S.E.2d 93 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Since valuing property at the property's fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" such that fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when the properties are not of a type generally bought or sold in the open market. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., 245 Ga. 229, 264 S.E.2d 174 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Private riverfront land not unique.</b> - Neither "privacy," which is inherent in ownership of all property, nor the fact that the condemned land was "riverfront" property, would authorize a charge on the condemned property having a value "peculiar" to the owner, or that the realty was "unique." Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, 165 Ga. App. 355, 299 S.E.2d 592 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Recovery beyond fair market value for property of unique value.</b> - The measure of the condemnee's recovery is the fair market value of the property taken, and a condemnee can only recover for the value that the property has to the condemnee over and above fair market value in such cases when the evidence shows that the property had some unique and special economic, not merely sentimental, value to the condemnee alone. Fulton County v. Cox, 99 Ga. App. 743, 109 S.E.2d 849 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When there is some evidence tending to show that the property to be taken has a unique suitability, due to the property's location, for the purpose to which the property was being put, it is not error to instruct the jury that the jury is not restricted to market value in determining just and adequate compensation. DeKalb County v. Cowan, 151 Ga. App. 753, 261 S.E.2d 478 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Recovery of business losses.</b> - Business losses are recoverable as a separate item only if the property is "unique." DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., 245 Ga. 314, 265 S.E.2d 10 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When a business belongs to the landowner, total destruction of the business at the location must be proven before business losses may be recovered as a separate element of compensation. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., 245 Ga. 314, 265 S.E.2d 10 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When the business belongs to a separate lessee, the lessee may recover for business losses as an element of compensation separate from the value of the land whether the destruction of the lessee's business is total or merely partial, provided only that the loss is not remote or speculative. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., 245 Ga. 314, 265 S.E.2d 10 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The damages sustained by a business are separate and apart from the damages sustained by the real estate on which it is located. Old S. Bottle Shop, Inc. v. Department of Transp., 175 Ga. App. 295, 333 S.E.2d 127 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Instruction on unique value erroneous unless evidence supports finding of such value.</b> - An instruction to the jury in a condemnation case which inferentially authorizes the jury to award damages to the condemnee for the land taken based on the peculiar value of the land to the condemnee alone, as distinguished from the land's market value, generally is error when there is no evidence to authorize a finding that the land taken had any such peculiar value to the condemnee apart from the land's market value. State Hwy. Dep't v. Martin, 111 Ga. App. 428, 142 S.E.2d 84 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><b>4. Comparable Sales and Offers of Purchase</b></p>
<p class="p11"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Evidence of sale of similar property admissible.</b> - Evidence of a sale of similar property, located near that condemned, at or near the time the condemnation proceeding was instituted, is admissible. Housing Auth. v. Spink, 91 Ga. App. 72, 85 S.E.2d 80 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">On a question of the value of land sought to be condemned, it is competent to introduce evidence of sales of property similar to that in question, made at or near the time of the taking. The exact limit either of similarity or difference, or of nearness or remoteness in point of time is difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe by any arbitrary rule, but must to a large extent depend on the location and the character of the property and the circumstances of the case. Fulton County v. Cox, 99 Ga. App. 743, 109 S.E.2d 849 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Judicial determination of similarity required.</b> - The introduction of evidence of particular sales is permitted after such evidence has been qualified by evidence of the similarity of the comparable property with the property being condemned or taken. After the introduction of such preliminary evidence of similarity, the trial judge must determine whether the comparable property is sufficiently similar or nearly like the property being condemned, and whether the time and manner of the particular sale are truly illustrative of the value of the property being condemned. Fulton County v. Cox, 99 Ga. App. 743, 109 S.E.2d 840 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Generally, evidence of sales of property similar to that in question made at or near the time of the taking is competent evidence and may be considered to throw light on the issue of the value of the property sought to be condemned; however, the determination as to whether or not the witness testified as to comparable properties similar to that in question is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Oglethorpe Power Corp. v. Seasholtz, 157 Ga. App. 723, 278 S.E.2d 429 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Oral and not binding offers cast no light upon value.</b> - Oral and not binding offers are so easily made and refused in a mere passing conversation, and under circumstances involving no responsibility on either side, as to cast no light upon the question of value. Southern Ry. v. Miller, 94 Ga. App. 701, 96 S.E.2d 297 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When an offer to purchase excludes on its face the property to be taken and thus constitutes merely an offer to purchase the remainder, and another offer, while it includes the property to be taken, appears to be nothing more than a mere oral expression of willingness to purchase, unaccompanied by any proposed terms, any indication of ability to perform, or anything else which might indicate that it was a serious and bona fide offer, such "offers" are too susceptible of fabrication to be allowed into evidence even as a partial basis of opinion testimony.

<p class="p6">The question of consequential damages involves the consideration of the value of the remaining land before the taking and the land's value after the taking and a determination of whether or not there was a difference in the value before and after the taking. Sumner v. State Hwy. Dep't, 110 Ga. App. 646, 139 S.E.2d 493 (1964); Simon v. Department of Transp., 245 Ga. 478, 265 S.E.2d 777 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">Consequential benefits to remaining lands may be shown only as an offset against consequential damages and may not be used as an offset against the value of the land actually taken.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Relevant factors in determining consequential damage to remaining property.</b> - That condemned land produces items which may be sold in the market may be shown as affecting the land's market value. The presence or absence of water on the land may be shown in like manner. The extent of the land's productive capacity and the amount and nature of available water is relevant. If these are removed or lessened by the improvements made, that is relevant in showing consequential damage to the property remaining. State Hwy. Dep't v. Harrison, 115 Ga. App. 349, 154 S.E.2d 723, overruled on other grounds, Willis v. Hill, 116 Ga. App. 848, 159 S.E.2d 145 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Evidence of noise and other elements allowed in determining consequential damages.</b> - If shown to affect adversely the value and use of the condemnee's remaining property, evidence of noise and other elements may be taken into consideration by the jury in determining consequential damages. State Hwy. Dep't v. Augusta Dist. of N. Ga. Conference of Methodist Church, 115 Ga. App. 162, 154 S.E.2d 29 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Damage to one contiguous parcel determinable without reference to others.</b> - When adjoining or contiguous parcels of land belonging to the same owner are put to separate and distinct uses, and do not together constitute one entire tract, damages to one of the parcels, as a result of the performance of public work in the neighborhood, is determinable without reference to the effect of the work upon the adjoining land.

<p class="p6"><b>Damage to portion of tract balanced against benefit to whole.</b> - When a tract of land having a value and a peculiar utility as an entirety is affected by public work, the owner of the land, for the purpose of recovering damages resulting from the performance of the work, cannot sever from the entire tract a portion of the land which has been peculiarly damaged and recover damages without reference to the benefits accruing to the entire tract by virtue of the performance of the work.

Whipple v. County of Houston, 214 Ga. 532, 105 S.E.2d 898 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Mistaken theory that construction would improve, not damage, remaining property.</b> - When, due to a mistake of fact unmixed with negligence, the condemnation proceeding for a public road was conducted throughout upon the theory that the road would be paved at approximately grade level, thus improving rather than damaging the remaining abutting property, and there was nothing to indicate that a fill of from 25 to 40 feet would be made in front of the remaining property which would damage it in the amount of approximately $20,000.00, a petition in equity, alleging these facts and alleging that the mistake prevented the owners from proving this consequential damage, alleged a cause of action to set aside the award and the judgment of condemnation and to recover the full damages.

<p class="p6"><b>Valuation of adjacent land taken for bridge and roads.</b> - It is proper, in order to arrive at just and adequate compensation in determining the value of adjacent land taken for the bridge and roads, that its prospective value as a bridge site and its present value as a ferry site may be taken into the calculation. Mitchell County v. Hudspeth, 151 Ga. 767, 108 S.E. 305 (1921). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When land is taken for a public highway and bridge over a stream, the owners are not entitled to have the diminution or destruction of the profits of their ferry, due to the erection of the bridge, considered in determining the value of the property taken by the state for its highway and the bridge, when the franchise of the owners to operate the ferry is not exclusive.

<p class="p6"><b>Condemnor's testimony, standing alone, held inadmissible on question of consequential damages.</b> - When a limited access highway is condemned by the state, which highway cuts off several acres from the remainder of the land of the condemnee leaving those several acres without any access thereto, testimony offered by the condemnor that with access there would be no damage to the isolated land, standing alone, is inadmissible and without probative value on the question of consequential damages to those several acres without access.

<p class="p6"><b>Evidence admissible as to effect of condemnation on landowner's business.</b> - In an action for value of the property taken by the Department of Transportation, evidence which was admissible to reflect how the condemnation had adversely affected the landowner's business had probative value and was admissible for consideration by the jury.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Measure of damages for property taken is pecuniary loss to owner.</b> - The measure of damages for property taken by the right of eminent domain, being compensatory in its nature, is the pecuniary loss sustained by the owner, taking into consideration all relevant factors; ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Damages ordinarily measured by market value.</b> - Ordinarily, when an entire parcel of property is taken, or an entire leasehold interest is taken, the measure of the damages is the "market value" of the land or leasehold interest as the case might be; market value has been defined as the price which may be paid by one wishing but not required to buy, to one wishing but not required to sell. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Assessment of consequential damages.</b> - In assessing consequential damages, the difference would lie in the valuation of the land which remains after condemnation, as compared with the value of that fragment of land before the condemnation was commenced; in considering this "damage," the assessors or jury would be bound to deduct from the whole damage, any increase which might result from the improvement respecting the sales value or market value of the tract not taken. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Payment of taxes on land taken by eminent domain.</b> - The payment of city or county taxes is not a proper element of damages in a condemnation case; the payment of property taxes is a responsibility of the landowner only so long as the landowner, in fact, owns the property. The property owner or condemnee would be responsible for payment of taxes up to the date of taking; after that time, the responsibility for the payment of these taxes would lie upon the condemning body, if in fact that body is an entity which would have the responsibility for payment of these taxes. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-494.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Cost of moving personal property not an element of damage.</b> - The cost of moving personal property from real estate which is taken for public purposes cannot be considered as an element of damage, as such; however, the cost of removal of either fixtures, buildings, or personalty, especially when used for business purposes, may be considered as one of the factors entering into a determination of the value of the real estate to the condemnee from whom the property is taken. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Moving cost may be illustrative of damage done by taking.</b> - The cost of moving personal property may in many instances, be evidential as to, or illustrative of, the damage done to such personal property by the taking; such damage must be paid by the authority which so takes it for public purposes. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 276.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When area taken for right of way intersects building on tract involved,</b> i.e., a portion of the building lies on land which is taken, and a portion of the building lies on land which is not taken, that portion of the building which extends upon the right of way may be severed if it is practicable to do so without destruction of the building; if severance would result in destruction, then the measure of damage to the building is its full value. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In circumstances when a condemnation causes the intersection of a building by the line drawn between the land taken and the land not taken, if it is impossible to sever the building and the whole building would be destroyed, the value of the land without the building taken would be charged against the condemnor; the true market value of the remaining portion of the condemnee's land without the building, of course, it being destroyed, would be compared with the value of that tract before taking. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Expense of removing facilities from railroad right-of-way.</b> - There is no reason why the State Highway Department (now Department of Transportation) may not bear the expense (or that part which is not borne by the railroad or the United States government) of the temporary and permanent removal of facilities located on a railroad right of way. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 132. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">No distinction can be drawn, as to the obligation to pay the cost of removal of facilities on a right of way, between temporary relocations and permanent relocations. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 132.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Damage construed.</b> - The word "damaged," has a broader meaning than the word "taken," and is designed to impose liability on a condemnor for consequential injuries to property which would not otherwise exist. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, 165 Ga. App. 348, 299 S.E.2d 594 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnor liable for both direct and consequential damages.</b> - In condemnation proceedings, the condemnor is liable not only for direct damages for the actual land taken for the public use, but in addition thereto for all consequential damages which naturally and proximately flow from the taking of the land to the remainder of the parcel or tract of land not taken as tend to diminish its market value. Georgia Power Co. v. McCrea, 46 Ga. App. 279, 167 S.E. 542 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There are two elements to be considered in connection with the damages in condemnation cases, the actual value of the land taken and the consequential damage or consequential benefit to the remaining land. Fulton County v. Power, 109 Ga. App. 783, 137 S.E.2d 474 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Just and adequate compensation.</b> - In an eminent domain proceeding, the "just and adequate compensation" due a condemnee is "the value" of the land taken, plus any consequential damages to the remainder if there is a partial taking, which may not be less than "the actual value" of the property taken or damaged. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, 165 Ga. App. 348, 299 S.E.2d 594 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Law allows damages to property not actually appropriated</b> in an eminent domain proceeding as consequential damages if such damages are shown. Justice v. State Hwy. Dept., 100 Ga. App. 794, 112 S.E.2d 307 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Consequential damages must be recovered in condemnation proceeding.</b> - Consequential damages to property not taken in a condemnation proceeding resulting from the proper construction and maintenance of the object for which the property is taken must be recovered, if recovered at all, in the condemnation proceeding. State Hwy. Dep't v. Kaylor, 110 Ga. App. 46, 137 S.E.2d 664 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Direct and consequential damages to be figured separately.</b> - In any eminent domain case, the evidence and instructions to the jury should be such that the jurors are enabled to figure separately the value of the land or interest therein which is taken and the consequential damages to the land not taken, the latter of course balanced against any consequential benefits and by adding the two figures return a lump sum verdict which includes both items of depreciated value to the landowner. Georgia Power Co. v. Sinclair, 122 Ga. App. 305, 176 S.E.2d 639 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Value of land taken and consequential damages are matters of opinion.</b> - The question of the value of the land taken and condemned and the amount of consequential damages to be assessed against the condemnor for the remaining land are matters of opinion. Derrick v. Rabun County, 107 Ga. App. 229, 129 S.E.2d 583 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Measure of damages for property taken is pecuniary loss sustained by owner,</b> taking into consideration all relevant factors. Ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be the fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. Housing Auth. v. Savannah Iron &amp; Wire Works, Inc., 91 Ga. App. 881, 87 S.E.2d 671 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Only direct damages allowed when legal improvements properly erected and maintained.</b> - When the public authorities properly erected and properly maintain the improvements authorized by law, the only right of action which is maintainable is that conferred by state constitutional provision; it does not sound in tort, and the recovery permitted is strictly limited to the direct damage inflicted by diminishing the market value of the property damaged, as measured by the difference in its market value before and immediately after the construction of the public works, excluding all consequential damages subsequently accruing, such as might be recoverable in an action sounding in tort, based on the maintenance of a continuing, abatable nuisance. Felton v. State Hwy. Bd., 51 Ga. App. 930, 181 S.E. 506 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Contiguity of parcels does not render the aggregate a tract.</b> - The mere contiguity of several parcels of land belonging to one owner does not in itself render the lots in the aggregate an entire tract. Gaines v. City of Calhoun, 42 Ga. App. 89, 155 S.E. 214 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Platting and subdivision does not necessarily destroy unity of tract.</b> - The mere platting of a tract of land and its subdivision into vacant building lots does not necessarily destroy the oneness or unity of the entire property.

A majority is sufficient. Cable v. State Hwy. Bd., 208 Ga. 593, 68 S.E.2d 564 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Assessment made by two assessors in absence of third cannot be collaterally attacked</b> in a suit for injunction. If the assessment is irregular or erroneous, it must be vacated and set aside in a direct attack upon the award. Cable v. State Hwy. Bd., 208 Ga. 593, 68 S.E.2d 564 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>In a proceeding to condemn only a portion of a tract of land</b> the only question to be determined by the jury is the amount which the condemnor should pay as just and adequate compensation for the part taken and consequential damages, if any, to the remaining portion of the tract, as such damages may be offset, but not exceeded, by consequential benefits. Alabama Power Co. v. Chandler, 217 Ga. 550, 123 S.E.2d 767 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Damages allowed for loss of right of access.</b> - When a street upon which a lot abuts is closed by an obstruction at an intersecting street, which, as respects the lot, makes the street upon which it abuts a cul-de-sac, although the obstruction is neither immediately in front of the lot nor touches the lot, and the obstruction thereby materially diminishes and curtails the right of the owner to the free and uninterrupted use of the street in front of the lot, as a means of access to and from different parts of the city, it constitutes a special damage to the lot, different in kind from that inflicted upon the community in general, and the owner has a right of action in damages therefor. Felton v. State Hwy. Bd., 51 Ga. App. 930, 181 S.E. 506 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>No damages for easement to and from limited access highway.</b> - When land is condemned for use as a new limited access highway the condemnee is not entitled to damages, actual or consequential, for lack of access to that new highway by reason of any rights of easement for ingress and egress to and from that highway. State Hwy. Dep't v. Ford, 112 Ga. App. 270, 144 S.E.2d 924 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Examination of condemnee when perpetual easement for aviation purposes sought.</b> - When the condemnor seeks a perpetual easement for aviation purposes, in, to, upon and over, all of condemnee's property, the examination of the condemnee is not limited to planes using only one particular runway.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to instruct on definition of "consequential damages".</b> - Since the court's jury charge never defined the term "consequential damages" and was vague in charging the method of determining consequential damages, the charge was too vague and that part of the judgment awarding consequential damages was overruled. DOT v. Clower, 170 Ga. App. 750, 318 S.E.2d 161 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>"Value," as used in reference to land taken under eminent domain,</b> is a relative term depending on the circumstances.

<p class="p6">It was not reversible error to charge the jury that "value," which is qualified in this section as "actual value," is the fair and reasonable value of a strip of land actually taken.

<p class="p6"><b>Damages and judgment bar recovery of consequential damages except those resulting from negligent construction.</b> - Since former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 36-503 through 36-506 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 22-2-62 and 22-2-63) plainly provide that the appraisers in proceedings to condemn private property for public purposes shall assess actual damages for the property taken and consequential damages to the property not taken, an award of damages and judgment of condemnation bar recovery of consequential damages except such as result from negligent and improper construction.

<p class="p6"><b>Proper construction not grounds for damages to remainder of property.</b> - Construction that is done with due care and is proper is not grounds for recovery for damages to the remainder of the property of the condemnee.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Mistaken theory that construction would improve, not damage, remaining property.</b> - When, due to a mistake of fact unmixed with negligence, the condemnation proceeding for a public road was conducted throughout upon the theory that the road would be paved at approximately grade level, thus improving rather than damaging the remaining abutting property, and there was nothing to indicate that a fill of from 25 to 40 feet would be made in front of the remaining property which would damage it in the amount of approximately $20,000.00, a petition in equity, alleging these facts and alleging that the mistake prevented the owners from proving this consequential damage, alleged a cause of action to set aside the award and the judgment of condemnation and to recover the full damages.

<p class="p6"><b>Jury charge regarding consequential damages.</b> - The court did not err in charging the jury where in part of the charge the correct rules as contained in this section were given as to the assessment of consequential damages in case the consequential benefits equaled or exceeded the consequential damages. Georgia, Fla. &amp; Ala. Ry. v. Norman, 140 Ga. 42, 78 S.E. 411 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Instruction held reversible error.</b> - Instructing the jury that the jury could reduce the amount of consequential damages to the remainder of the property by the amount of special consequential benefits was reversible error since there was no evidence from which the jury could have formed a reasonable estimate of the amount or value of such benefits. Perry v. Department of Transp., 193 Ga. App. 254, 387 S.E.2d 445 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Assessment of consequential damages.</b> - In assessing consequential damages, the difference would lie in the valuation of the land which remains after condemnation, as compared with the value of that fragment of land before the condemnation was commenced; in considering this "damage," the assessors or jury would be bound to deduct from the whole damage, any increase which might result from the improvement respecting the sales value or market value of the tract not taken. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Payment of taxes on land taken by eminent domain.</b> - The payment of city or county taxes is not a proper element of damages in a condemnation case; the payment of property taxes is a responsibility of the landowner only so long as the landowner, in fact, owns the property. The property owner or condemnee would be responsible for payment of taxes up to the date of taking; after that time, the responsibility for the payment of these taxes would lie upon the condemning body, if in fact that body is an entity which would have the responsibility for payment of these taxes. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-494.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Cost of transferring personal business articles to new location cannot be charged as such,</b> but the reasonable cost of such moving may be evidence which is illustrative of the damage to the property, measured as of that particular owner; therefore, the cost of such moving should be ascertained and estimated, either when arriving at a value for negotiation, or when determining evidence of a value in condemnation case. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 276.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When area taken for right of way intersects building on tract involved,</b> i.e., a portion of the building lies on land which is taken, and a portion of the building lies on land which is not taken, that portion of the building which extends upon the right of way may be severed if it is practicable to do so without destruction of the building; if severance would result in destruction, then the measure of damage to the building is the building's full value. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When a condemnation causes the intersection of a building by the line drawn between the land taken and the land not taken, when it is impossible to sever the building and the whole building would be destroyed, the value of the land without the building taken would be charged against the condemnor; the true market value of the remaining portion of the condemnee's land without the building, of course, it being destroyed, would be compared with the value of that tract before taking. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">In case either party is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessors' award, he or they may, within ten days from the time the award is filed, enter in writing an appeal from the award to the superior court of the county where the award is filed. At the term succeeding the filing of the appeal, it shall be the duty of the judge to cause an issue to be made and tried by a jury as to the value of the property or interest taken or the amount of damage done, with the same right to move for a new trial and file an appeal as in other cases at law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Legislature intended to concern itself with time after which appeal may not be filed,</b> with no regard to the time when filing is premature, except that of course the award of the assessors must be in existence, and the rights of the parties fixed, in order that there may be something to appeal from. The filing itself is not essential to the validity but only to the enforceability of the award. Hodges v. South Ga. Natural Gas Co., 111 Ga. App. 180, 141 S.E.2d 182 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Award of assessors, standing alone, is not judgment of court</b> since the judgment is entered up by the court based on the award, but it is a judgment rendered by a tribunal which is competent to fix the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings with reference to the matters and things involved. It can be amended only by permission of the court. Hodges v. South Ga. Natural Gas Co., 111 Ga. App. 180, 141 S.E.2d 182 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Time for appealing assessor's award.</b> - Since the Board of Assessors did not file and record their award, apparently on the belief that the parties had decided on their own what the just compensation was for the condemnor obtaining the right of way, the 10-day time period for filing an appeal to a jury from the time the award was filed never arose and the condemnee was not barred from filing an appeal to a jury.

<p class="p6">An appeal to the superior court from an award of assessors in a condemnation proceeding is a de novo investigation, if the assessors had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. If the assessors do have such jurisdiction, the appeal will not be dismissed nor the case remanded, though the award be in fact a nullity. Livsey v. Walton County, 47 Ga. App. 211, 170 S.E. 268 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The appeal from an appraisers' award on condemnation proceedings brings the matter de novo to the jury on matters of value of the property taken and amount of damage done. Tuggle v.

<p class="p6">In condemnation proceedings, the only issue before the assessors or a jury on appeal is the amount of compensation to be paid, and neither the assessors nor a jury can determine whether the condemnor is proceeding legally; the remedy of the landowners is to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the illegal proceedings. Garden Parks v. Fulton County, 88 Ga. App. 97, 76 S.E.2d 31 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The sole question to be passed upon by the assessors, or a jury in the superior court on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid. Whether the quantity of land sought to be taken is necessary and proper for the purpose for which it is sought is a question not involved in such a proceeding. Johnson v. Fulton County, 103 Ga. App. 873, 121 S.E.2d 54 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6">While all relevant legal and equitable issues may be raised in an appeal from the assessors' award in a condemnation proceeding, the sole issue for the jury is value.

App. 695, 182 S.E.2d 160 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">An appeal to the superior court jury is on the issue of value and damages alone. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, 135 Ga. App. 63, 217 S.E.2d 304 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Payment to court equivalent of payment to owner, not owner's acceptance.</b> - Payment into court is the equivalent of payment to the owner only insofar as the right to enter upon the property and prosecute the work under this section is concerned. It is not the equivalent of acceptance of the award by the owner nor of payment to one insofar as it affects one's right to pursue one's remedy in equity. Williams v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Amendments and readjustments of petitions authorized on appeal.</b> - On the appeal from the award of the appraisers, it is the duty of the judge to cause an issue to be made, and that in itself authorizes amendments and readjustments of the petitions in so far as they do not disturb the actual property involved. Tuggle v. De Kalb County, 101 Ga. App. 890, 115 S.E.2d 751 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Including amendment of acreage description.</b> - When land to be condemned is accurately described by metes and bounds but the acreage description is not completely accurate, the acreage description may be changed by amendment on appeal of the appraisers' award, and such change is no ground for dismissing the appeal.

<p class="p6"><b>Payment of amount of jury verdict is condition precedent to appeal.</b> - Under the mandate of the Constitution, that private property cannot be taken or damaged for public use without first paying just and adequate compensation to the owner, the payment of the amount of a jury verdict in excess of the prior appraisal by assessors, or special master, is a condition precedent to a valid appeal from such verdict and the judgment based thereon.

<p class="p6"><b>Tender of award did not impact right to jury.</b> - Although the condemnor tendered compensation into the trial court's registry that appeared to represent the sum the condemnor and condemnee had agreed was sufficient compensation, the tender of the award did not affect the condemnee's right to appeal to a jury.

<p class="p6"><b>Liability for interest on difference between assessors' award and final judgment.</b> - When the amount of the final judgment is less than the award made by the assessors, the condemnee is not liable for the payment of interest on the difference in the amount of the award and the judgment except from the date of the judgment.

<p class="p6"><b>Interest on award withdrawn by condemnee held improper.</b> - When the condemnor paid into the registry of the court the sum awarded to the condemnee by the appointed assessors, and the court paid the sum to the condemnee, the condemnor appealed from the assessors' award, and the court entered judgment for the condemnor for the difference between the assessors' award and the jury's verdict, the award of interest at seven percent per annum from the date the condemnee withdrew the award from the court was improper.

<p class="p6"><b>Error in instruction on computation of interest cured.</b> - While the court erred in instructing the jury that interest should be computed from the date of the award, as the amount of the award of the assessors was paid, and the interest on the difference between the amount of the verdict and the amount tendered should have been computed from the date of the tender, and not from the date of the award, the error was fully cured and rendered harmless to the plaintiff by the defendants writing off all possible interest that the jury could have computed on the damages awarded by them, in excess of the amount of the original award, from the date of that award to the date of the verdict.

<p class="p6"><b>Use of condemned property.</b> - The appropriation to public use amounts to a withdrawal only from such private uses as will interfere with the public use. Private use is of course to be subordinated to the public use, but, when the fee remains in the owner, the owner is entitled to make any use of the property which is not inconsistent with its use for the purpose for which it was taken.

<p class="p6">A power company that acquired an electric transmission line easement by condemnation in 1985 had not permanently ceased using the land under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-85; thus, the landowner from whom the land was acquired was not entitled to recover possession of the land.

<p class="p6"><b>Applicability.</b> - Since the original condemnor acquired part of a 50-foot easement by grant and part by condemnation, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-85 was inapplicable in a condemnation action brought by the condemnor's licensee to change the use of the easement from a petroleum pipeline to a fiber optic communications system; even if O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-85 were applicable, it was not shown that the condemnor had ceased using the pipeline for the purpose of conducting its business.

<p class="p6"><b>Condemned property reverts to owner if purpose permanently ceases.</b> - The clause in this section relating to the reverter of the condemned use means that if the use of the condemned property in the business to be served permanently ceases, the property is not to be used for other purposes, but the easement ceases or reverts to the then owners of the servient land. Florida Blue Ridge Corp. v. Tennessee Elec. Power Co., 106 F.2d 913 (5th Cir. 1939), cert. denied, 309 U.S. 666, 60 S. Ct. 591, 84 L. Ed. 1013 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Appraisal to be updated to date of hearing before special master.</b> - When condemnation is necessary, the appraiser should be instructed to update the appraisal to the date of the hearing before the special master; this appraisal should contemplate that the amount of the award will be paid into court by condemnor within ten days of such hearing by the special master, and this is the amount that the appraiser should be prepared to testify to if and when there is an appeal of the matter to a jury in the superior court by either party thereto. 1970 Op.

<p class="p6"><b>No bad faith shown on part of county in condemnation.</b> - Record supported that the condemnation of the buffer property would serve a public purpose and that the county did not act in bad faith because failing to disclose the extent of methane migration provided no financial benefit for the county since at no time did the county discount the price the county was offering the property owner for the buffer property due to ignorance of the status of methane migration.

<p class="p6">The special master method of condemnation is intended to be an expeditious method of arriving at a just and adequate compensation to be paid a citizen before the citizen's interest in property may be condemned.

Shoemaker v. Department of Transp., 240 Ga. 573, 241 S.E.2d 820 (1978); Allen v. Hall County, 156 Ga. App. 629, 275 S.E.2d 713 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnor vested with broad discretion as to necessity of taking.</b> - It is clear that in enacting Ga. L. 1957, p. 387, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 et seq., the General Assembly intended to vest a very broad discretion in the condemning authority as to the necessity for the taking, and that "other matters material" to the rights of condemnees generally might be determined under proper pleadings in the case. City of Carrollton v. Walker, 215 Ga. 505, 111 S.E.2d 79 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Broad discretion as to selection of property.</b> - Large discretion is vested in a party having the right to condemn, in the selection of particular property to be condemned. Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, 237 Ga. 358, 227 S.E.2d 362 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Time for filing of defensive pleadings</b> (as opposed to their sufficiency) is governed by the special statutory procedure of Ga. L. 1957, p. 387, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 et seq. Nodvin v. Georgia Power Co., 125 Ga. App. 821, 189 S.E.2d 118 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Amendment of petition to provide more specific description.</b> - A condemnor may amend its petition by striking two paragraphs describing the proposed right of way and the uses of the right of way, and stating two new paragraphs, where all that the amendment does is to put the condemnees on notice of a more specific description of the right of way sought to be condemned and the proposed use of the right of way. Leach v. Georgia Power Co., 228 Ga. 16, 183 S.E.2d 755 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Proceeding under general civil practice rules cannot follow final adjudication.</b> - When there has been a final adjudication in a special master condemnation proceeding which is designed to be expeditious, a party may not later tender an answer to the petition under the general rules of civil practice. Nodvin v. Georgia Power Co., 125 Ga. App. 821, 189 S.E.2d 118 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Judicial review of master's findings.</b> - If the special master makes findings not only as to just and adequate compensation for the property taken but also as to other matters material to the condemnee's respective rights, the proper method for the condemnee to obtain judicial review of the special master's findings in regard to matters other than the just and adequate compensation for the property taken is to file objections to the special master's award prior to the court entering an order and making the award a judgment of the court. Georgia Power Co. v. Baggarley, 133 Ga. App. 399, 211 S.E.2d 23 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When legal objections are raised before and passed upon by the special master, to obtain review of these objections exceptions must be taken to the master's findings prior to the superior court's entry of an order and judgment condemning the property. If no exceptions are taken and the master's findings are made the judgment of the court, the court's judgment is final insofar as it adjudicates these legal issues, until set aside or reversed in a manner provided by law. Allen v. Hall County, 156 Ga. App. 629, 275 S.E.2d 713 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnee bound by decision to use special master.</b> - Having chosen and agreed to use the special master proceeding, a condemnee is bound by the applicable law regarding the special master's proceeding. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth. v. Central Parking Sys., 167 Ga. App. 649, 307 S.E.2d 93 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Objections or exceptions must be specific.</b> - Litigants have a responsibility to make their timely objections or exceptions to the award of the special master in specific rather than in generalized form. Beck v. Cobb County, 180 Ga. App. 808, 350 S.E.2d 818 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to file exceptions constitutes waiver.</b> - The failure of a party to file exceptions to the master's award for determination by the superior court results in a waiver of the party's right to further litigate any nonvalue issues. Beck v. Cobb County, 180 Ga. App. 808, 350 S.E.2d 818 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Condemnation award and judgment, unexcepted to and unappealed from, is res judicata</b> as to the issue of the existence and length of any leasehold interest. Therefore, the judgment in the condemnation proceeding is conclusive to all nonvalue issues raised on appeal. Allen v. Hall County, 156 Ga. App. 629, 275 S.E.2d 713 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Description of property sought held sufficiently definite.</b> - The condemnor's description of the right of way sought to be condemned was sufficiently definite when the petition (a) described with certainty the entire tract of land through which the right of way was to pass, (b) described the right of way in metes, bounds and distances, (c) described minutely the proposed construction of poles, lines, etc., for the transmission of electric current, and (d) included a plat showing the property sought to be condemned. Leach v. Georgia Power Co., 228 Ga. 16, 183 S.E.2d 755 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Dismissal of condemnation petition inappropriate.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the property owners' motion to dismiss the condemnation petition, nor in overruling their exception to the special master's award, because the evidence at the special master hearing showed that the telecommunications condemnor made an effort to agree on a purchase price for the property, but that those negotiations ultimately failed, which was sufficient to show that it could not procure the property by contract within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-1-6. White v. Ringgold Tel. Co., 334 Ga. App. 325, 779 S.E.2d 378 (2015), cert. denied, No. S16C0404, 2016 Ga. LEXIS 148 (Ga. 2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Special master is officer of court.</b> - The original arbiter is no longer merely a person especially equipped to determine value; the arbiter is a competent attorney under oath especially appointed by the court. The arbiter is, accordingly, an arm of the court, and the arbiter's decision is judicial or at least quasi-judicial. Johnson v. Fulton County, 103 Ga. App. 873, 121 S.E.2d 54 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">A special master is a judicial officer within contemplation of the immunity doctrine. West End Whses., Inc. v. Dunlap, 141 Ga. App. 333, 233 S.E.2d 284 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Rulings of neither auditor nor special master are immediately final.</b> Wiggins v. City of Macon, 120 Ga. App. 197, 169 S.E.2d 667 (1969); Sweat v. Georgia Power Co., 235 Ga. 281, 219 S.E.2d 384 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Special master's rulings and findings may be excepted to in trial court</b> and disposed of in like manner before any award, which is the end product of the proceeding, is offered to the court and a judgment of taking is entered up based on the award. Wiggins v. City of Macon, 120 Ga. App. 197, 169 S.E.2d 667 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Challenge to special masters award.</b> - Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover. Ga. Power Co. v. Stowers, 282 Ga. App. 695, 639 S.E.2d 605 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">When the business belongs to a separate lessee, the lessee may recover for business losses as an element of compensation separate from the value of the land whether the destruction of the lessee's business is total or merely partial, provided only that the loss is not remote or speculative.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Remaining term of lease determined.</b> - When a lease provided that, for four additional five-year terms, tenants had the option of extending the lease, although rent for the renewal periods was not agreed to, the trial court correctly held that the tenants had only a nine month's tenancy remaining on the date of taking because the 20-year renewal provision was unenforceable for a lack of certainty as to the amount of rent for that renewal period. Cann v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 196 Ga. App. 495, 396 S.E.2d 515 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Enhancement or impairment of value and lost profits not part of market value.</b> - The enhancement or impairment of value of the land, or the loss of profits resulting from the announcement of condemnation proceedings are not part of market value for the purposes of just and adequate compensation.

<p class="p6"><b>Loss of established business separate item from value of building.</b> - The loss of an established business is a separate and distinct item from the amount which a condemnee is entitled to recover as the actual value of the condemnee's building. R.E. Adams Properties, Inc. v. City of Gainesville, 125 Ga. App. 800, 189 S.E.2d 114 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Market value of property a jury question.</b> - Market value of property taken by the Department of Transportation is a matter of opinion, and may be established by direct as well as circumstantial evidence; it is peculiarly a matter for the jury, and the jury is not absolutely bound even by uncontradicted testimony of experts, but may consider the nature of the property involved, together with any other fact or circumstance properly within the knowledge of the jury which tends to establish the value of the property, and may arrive at a different figure than that of the experts, higher or lower, when the verdict reached is not so disparate as to justify an inference of gross mistake or undue bias. DOT v. Delta Mach. Prods. Co., 157 Ga. App. 423, 278 S.E.2d 73 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Jury consideration of actual value of land.</b> - While there may be circumstances in which the market value of the total property and the actual value of the improvements plus the actual value of the land are not the same, in such event the jury may still consider the actual value of the land or interest therein appropriated. DOT v. Brooks, 153 Ga. App. 386, 265 S.E.2d 610 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Pro rata valuation in partial taking not authorized.</b> - Charge to jury which employed a pro rata method of assessing the value of a partial taking was erroneous; statutes which govern the manner of assessment and set out the factors considered in determining compensation do not express such a relational mode. Bland v. Bulloch County, 205 Ga. App. 317, 422 S.E.2d 223, cert. denied, 205 Ga. App. 899, 422 S.E.2d 223 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Jury cannot consider value of property prior to time of taking.</b> - Since the compensation to be paid for property condemned is to be determined by its value at the time of its actual taking, a jury cannot consider the value at a time prior to the actual time of taking. West v. City of Atlanta, 123 Ga. App. 255, 180 S.E.2d 277 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Jury cannot determine date of taking for compensation purposes.</b> - The jury is not free to determine on the evidence that some date prior to the initiation of condemnation proceedings but after the announcement of the intent to condemn is the date of taking for the purposes of just and adequate compensation. R.E. Adams Properties, Inc. v. City of Gainesville, 125 Ga. App. 800, 189 S.E.2d 114 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Testimony of expert who examines property before and after taking.</b> - When an expert witness testifies as to the value of property in a condemnation case, and the examination of the witness discloses that the witness's examination of the property had been made both before and after the date of taking, this does not prevent the witness's testimony from having probative value as to the date of taking when the witness testifies as to the witness's familiarity with the property as of the date of taking. The witness's entire testimony cannot be excluded. West v. City of Atlanta, 123 Ga. App. 255, 180 S.E.2d 277 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Adequate method for determining compensation.</b> - The General Assembly, by enacting Ga. L. 1957, p. 387, <span class="s1">§§</span> 5, 11, and 14 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 22-2-102, 22-2-108, and 22-2-112), has provided an adequate method for determining the just and adequate compensation of property sought to be condemned under Ga. L. 1957, p. 387, <span class="s1">§</span> 12 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-110) of the act in no wise limits the master to an arbitrary finding. Kellett v. Fulton County, 215 Ga. 551, 111 S.E.2d 364 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>This section provides notice as a matter of law</b> to all of the parties and their counsel that the award will be filed within the required time and that an attempt to appeal the matter to a jury in the superior court coming more than 10 days after its filing, as provided by <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-112, comes too late. Wilson v. City of Waycross, 130 Ga. App. 253, 203 S.E.2d 301 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Time of filing award.</b> - Condemnation proceeding was not voided and nullified by the fact that special master's award was not filed with clerk of court within three days after date of hearing since the requirement of speedy disposition to protect the property owner is directory rather than jurisdictional. Savage v. Thomaston-Upson County Office Bldg. Auth., 205 Ga. App. 634, 422 S.E.2d 896, cert. denied, 205 Ga. App. 901, 422 S.E.2d 896 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There is no provision in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-110 which tolls the filing period for an appeal in the event that the special master fails to file the awards within three days of the hearing. Garner v. Georgia Transmission Corp., 235 Ga. App. 889, 510 S.E.2d 624 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Date of taking.</b> - It was error to hold that the date of taking property to acquire an easement for electrical transmission and distribution lines was the date of filing of the original condemnation petition; because the property was not being condemned for public street and road purposes, the date of taking was not governed by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-109, but by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 22-2-110 and 22-2-111, and thus the date of taking was when the amount provided in the award was paid into the trial court's registry.

<p class="p6"><b>Payment of award not condition precedent to condemnor's appeal.</b> - A condemnor is not required to pay the award of the special master into the registry of the court within ten days after the filing of the award, or at the time of, or prior to the filing of the appeal as a condition precedent to its right of appeal. Arnold v. State Hwy. Dep't, 116 Ga. App. 201, 156 S.E.2d 469 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Title vests upon entry of condemnation judgment.</b> - Because title to an owner's property vested in a city upon the entry of a condemnation judgment and the payment of the award to the owner in accordance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 22-2-110(b) and 22-2-111, the city was without authority to unilaterally dismiss the condemnation action and demand return of the previously paid award.

<p class="p6">On appeal from a special master's award, the court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on non-value issues because that would allow new evidence which was not before the special master or a repetition of evidence which should have been preserved by transcript. Simmons v. Webster County, 225 Ga. App. 830, 485 S.E.2d 501 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1110, 118 S. Ct. 1041, 140 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>This section provides for appeal from award of master to superior court</b> when the issue as to the value of the property shall be tried by a jury. Johnson v. Fulton County, 103 Ga. App. 873, 121 S.E.2d 54 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Appeal in superior court only method of correcting special master's errors.</b> - The only method of correcting any errors the assessors or a special master may have made in the original hearing and award is not by recommittal to that body but by an appeal in the superior court, which begins again the process of adjudication. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, 135 Ga. App. 63, 217 S.E.2d 304 (1975); Wrege v. Cobb County, 186 Ga. App. 512, 367 S.E.2d 817, cert. denied, 186 Ga. App. 919, 367 S.E.2d 817 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">If an appeal is taken by any party to a jury, the trial judge commits error in remanding the case to the special master. The trial judge should rule on all legal issues, either by pretrial order or during the course of the trial, in the jury case pending before the judge. Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, 237 Ga. 358, 227 S.E.2d 362 (1976); Walker v. Georgia Power Co., 177 Ga. App. 493, 339 S.E.2d 728 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The trial judge erred when the judge determined that the judge was not going to conduct the proceedings de novo but instead decided to review the decision of the special master on nonvalue issues as though occupying an appellate position in the proceedings, thereby addressing only whether there was any evidence to support the special master's findings of fact and whether there were any errors of law in the special master's conclusions of law. Wrege v. Cobb County, 186 Ga. App. 512, 367 S.E.2d 817, cert. denied, 186 Ga. App. 919, 367 S.E.2d 817 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Sims v. City of Toccoa, 256 Ga. 368, 349 S.E.2d 385 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Appeal to superior court not timely filed when condemnee fails to follow procedure for making objections known.</b> - When the condemnee fails to follow the procedure required by law in condemnation in rem proceedings before a special master in seeking to have the condemnee's objections made known to the court and to the special master, the superior court may rule that the condemnee's appeal to the superior court from the award of the special master was not timely filed.

<p class="p6"><b>Award becomes final if appeal not filed within ten days.</b> - If an appeal to a jury is desired it must be filed within ten days after the filing of the award or it becomes final.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No exception to ten-day period for appeal.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-112 does not set forth any exception to the ten-day period, and the right to file an appeal extended to exceptions taken to an amended award not substantively changing an original award.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Entry of judgment on award prior to expiration of ten-day period.</b> - Because all conditions and limitations provided by the Special Master's Act must be strictly followed, a superior court's entry of judgment on an award prior to the expiration of the ten-day period is reversible error absent an acquiescence or waiver. Fowler v. City of Warm Springs, 238 Ga. App. 601, 519 S.E.2d 703 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Appeal to superior court is de novo proceeding.</b> - If an appeal is taken pursuant to this section to a jury in the superior court, the trial in the superior court is a de novo proceeding, and it is the duty of the trial judge, by pretrial order or during the course of the trial, to rule on all legal issues. Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, 237 Ga. 358, 227 S.E.2d 362 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">An appeal by either party from the award of a special master is a de novo proceeding. Accordingly, if the case is tried again and the jury reaches a verdict smaller than the prepaid special master's award, the payor would be entitled to a judgment against the payee for the difference. Chastain v. Fayette County, 221 Ga. App. 118, 470 S.E.2d 513 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sole question on appeal is amount of compensation.</b> - The sole question to be passed upon by the assessors, or a jury in the superior court on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid. Whether the quantity of land sought to be taken is necessary and proper for the purpose for which it is sought is a question not involved in such a proceeding. Johnson v. Fulton County, 103 Ga. App. 873, 121 S.E.2d 54 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When an appeal is taken from a special master's award to a jury in the superior court pursuant to this section, the only issue for decision by the jury is the value of the subject property taken. Taylor v. Taylor County, 231 Ga. 209, 200 S.E.2d 887 (1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">While all issues may be raised in an appeal from the special master's award, the question of value is the sole issue to be submitted to the jury, and its fact-finding powers are limited to those facts directly touching on value. Walker v. Georgia Power Co., 177 Ga. App. 493, 339 S.E.2d 728 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">What O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 22-2-112 and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>22-2-114 make very clear is that the court, and not the jury on appeal, will decide the quantity of interest of each condemnee and will also decide the quality of such interest. Walker v. Georgia Power Co., 177 Ga. App. 493, 339 S.E.2d 728 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Trial court properly denied condemnees' motion for jury trial "on all issues of law and fact" upon appeal from an award by a special master when the sole jury question was the amount of the compensation award. Benton v. Georgia Marble Co., 258 Ga. 58, 365 S.E.2d 413 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Exceptions to special master's rulings on issues of law.</b> - If an appeal to a jury in the superior court is not taken by one of the parties pursuant to this section, then exceptions to the rulings on issues of law made by the special master must be timely filed and presented to the trial judge for decision. Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, 237 Ga. 358, 227 S.E.2d 362 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">One who does not except to the findings of the special master or appeal from the judgment of condemnation cannot, on the usual appeal to a jury on the question of value, raise legal issues by way of counterclaim or motion. Roberts v. Wise, 140 Ga. App. 1, 230 S.E.2d 320 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Special master's findings as to amount company was entitled to under condemnation proceeding were determinations of law; therefore, a jury trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-112 was an inappropriate method of appealing, and the company's failure to take exception to the findings acted as a waiver of its right to appeal. Big-Bin Dispos-All, Inc. v. City of Valdosta, 172 Ga. App. 746, 324 S.E.2d 501 (1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The failure of a party to file exceptions to the master's award for determination by the superior court results in a waiver of the party's right to further litigate any nonvalue issues. Beck v. Cobb County, 180 Ga. App. 808, 350 S.E.2d 818 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Since the condemnor never filed an exception to the special master's award concerning the requirement that it give the landowner advance notice of its entry onto the easement in non-emergency situations, and the superior court made the special master's award the judgment of the court, the trial court was correct when it determined that the notice provision was a viable portion of the condemnation judgment. Styers v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 263 Ga. 856, 439 S.E.2d 640 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover. Ga. Power Co. v. Stowers, 282 Ga. App. 695, 639 S.E.2d 605 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Condemnation of a property owner's land by a city was upheld on appeal, as was the trial court's judgment entered upon a jury verdict in the amount of $63,361 for the property and an award of attorney fees to the city, because the property owner never challenged the valuation made by a special master and also removed the amount awarded from the registry, thereby estopping the owner from challenging the legality of the taking on appeal. Mayo v. City of Stockbridge, 285 Ga. App. 58, 646 S.E.2d 79 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1279, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 707 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Right to jury trial on appeal does not extend to nonvalue issues.</b> - The right of the condemnees to appeal the award of the special master to a jury trial does not carry with it the right to have a jury trial on the other issues in the case. Leach v. Georgia Power Co., 228 Ga. 16, 183 S.E.2d 755 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Trial court erred in jury instructions.</b> - In a business's appeal of a special master's award of $5,000 for the loss of its business operation due to condemnation of the building it occupied and its challenge to a trial court judgment finding that it lacked a compensable business loss, that judgment was reversed because the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on the uniqueness test by incorrectly stating that difficulty relocating the business in the same general area was not a test for uniqueness. Further, the trial court erred by instructing the jury not to consider evidence of the business's difficulty in relocating to a comparable site in the area. ABM Realty Co. v. Bd. of Regents, 296 Ga. App. 658, 675 S.E.2d 549 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Finality of special master's judgment during pendency of appeal.</b> - When an appeal to a jury as to value was pending, the judgment of condemnation under the special master's condemnation procedure was not a final judgment subject to review in the absence of a certificate as provided for by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 6-701 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34). City of Atlanta v. Turner Adv. Co., 234 Ga. 1, 214 S.E.2d 501 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Market value is generally measure of damages.</b> - The general rule is that the measure of damages, excluding the question of consequential damages and benefits, is the market value of the property taken.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No bad faith shown on part of county.</b> - Record supported that the condemnation of the buffer property would serve a public purpose and that the county did not act in bad faith because failing to disclose the extent of methane migration provided no financial benefit for the county since at no time did the county discount the price the county was offering the property owner for the buffer property due to ignorance of the status of methane migration.

<p class="p6"><b>Consequential damages resulting from rentals lost before actual taking.</b> - After a judgment that a taking is complete, a condemnee may appeal to a jury under this section as to the consequential damages resulting from lost rentals during the period between the announcement of the intent to condemn and date for actual taking. Such an appeal is de novo as to the value of property taken or amount of damage done. R.E. Adams Properties, Inc. v. City of Gainesville, 125 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>Dismissal of appeal filed more than ten days after award.</b> - When, in a condemnation action, an appeal to a jury in superior court is filed more than ten days after the filing of the award of a special master, it is error for a trial court not to dismiss the appeal. Howell Enters., Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 123 Ga. App. 767, 182 S.E.2d 331 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">An appeal not filed within the prescribed ten-day period is not timely and the proper judgment is one of dismissal. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, 135 Ga. App. 63, 217 S.E.2d 304 (1975); Williams v. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth., 202 Ga. App. 549, 414 S.E.2d 909 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When property owner's appeal to jury was untimely because it was not filed within ten days of the filing of the special master's award, the owner's earlier demand for jury trial, filed before a special master award existed, did not qualify as a timely appeal to the jury, and inasmuch as no appeal to the jury was filed after the award was made and within ten days after the award was filed, the county's motion to dismiss the appeal was granted. Gwinnett County v. Grant, 181 Ga. App. 304, 352 S.E.2d 391 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The circumstances of a condemnation proceeding under the Special Master Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-112, prior to the 2006 amendment to that statute, include the fact that neither the special master nor the court are obligated to serve the parties with the award, and as a result a party has a duty to exercise diligence in determining when the award was filed; in such a situation, due diligence requires more than relying solely on a third party to provide information that could be obtained directly from the court. Rutland v. Ga. Power Co., 286 Ga. App. 14, 648 S.E.2d 436 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">As written, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 22-2-112 sets forth no exceptions to the ten day period to file an appeal from the date an award is filed with the superior court, and an appeal not filed within that ten day period is not timely and the proper judgment is one of dismissal. Rutland v. Ga. Power Co., 286 Ga. App. 14, 648 S.E.2d 436 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Payment of special master's award as condition precedent to appeal.</b> - A condemnor is not required to pay the award of the special master into the registry of the court within ten days after the filing of the award, or at the time of, or prior to the filing of the appeal as a condition precedent to its right of appeal. Arnold v. State Hwy. Dep't, 116 Ga. App. 201, 156 S.E.2d 469 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Payment of amount of verdict as condition precedent to appeal.</b> - Under the constitutional mandate that private property cannot be taken or damaged for public use without first paying just and adequate compensation to the owner, the payment of the amount of a jury verdict in excess of the prior appraisal by assessors, or special master, is a condition precedent to a valid appeal from such verdict and the judgment based thereon. City of Gainesville v. Loggins, 224 Ga. 114, 160 S.E.2d 374 (1968). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The payment of the amount of the jury verdict in excess of the prior appraisal by assessors, or special master, is a condition precedent to the condemnor seeking a second de novo jury trial. Paulk v. Georgia Power Co., 231 Ga. 721, 204 S.E.2d 154 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Tender of award to condemnee not condition precedent to condemnor's appeal.</b> - When a proceeding in rem is brought to condemn property for a public use, tender of the amount awarded by the special master to the apparent or ostensible owner of such property is not a condition precedent to the condemnor's right to pay the award into the registry of the court and enter an appeal to a jury. Hunt v. State Hwy. Dep't, 101 Ga. App. 797, 115 S.E.2d 384 (1960); Tillman v. State Hwy. Dep't, 101 Ga. App. 865, 115 S.E.2d 459 (1960); Slocumb v. Housing Auth., 101 Ga.

App. 35, 115 S.E.2d 760 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Entry of judgment when appeal results in lower award.</b> - When a special master makes an award to a condemnee, who subsequently is granted a jury trial on appeal which results in a lower award, the judgment should be entered even though the condemnor never appealed the award of the special master because an appeal by either party entitles both parties to a de novo determination of the issue. Smith v. Georgia Power Co., 131 Ga. App. 380, 205 S.E.2d 916 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Refusal by clerk of superior court to pay over amount awarded to condemnee</b> which had been paid to such clerk by the condemnor in connection with its appeal for a jury trial is not a proper ground for dismissal of such appeal because when the condemnor pays the amount of the award of the assessors into the registry of the court, the condemnor is not thereafter concerned with its distribution, and, further, such condemnor is not responsible for the clerk's actions. State Hwy. Dep't v. Taylor, 102 Ga. App. 15, 115 S.E.2d 703 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Payment of award by delivery of check.</b> - The delivery of a check, in the amount of the condemnation award, to the clerk of the superior court is not payment of such amount into the registry of the court when sufficient funds to cover such check are not on deposit at the bank on which such check is drawn during the ten day period when an appeal may be filed. State Hwy. Dep't v. Farmers Gin Co., 102 Ga. App. 35, 115 S.E.2d 760 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When jury is unable to agree on whether condemnee is entitled to recover expenses of litigation,</b> including attorney fees, the trial court is not authorized to grant the condemnee's motion for judgment notwithstanding the mistrial. DOT v. Glenn, 243 Ga. 21, 252 S.E.2d 906 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Trial court serves as trier of fact on nonvalue issues.</b> - There being no right to a jury trial on exceptions to the special master's rulings on nonvalue issues, the trial court sits as the trier of fact and its judgment will not be disturbed if there is any evidence in the record to sustain it. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth. v. Central Parking Sys., 167 Ga. App. 649, 307 S.E.2d 93 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Evidentiary hearing not required.</b> - On appeal from a special master's award, the court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on non-value issues because that would allow new evidence which was not before the special master or a repetition of evidence which should have been preserved by transcript. Simmons v. Webster County, 225 Ga. App. 830, 485 S.E.2d 501 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1110, 118 S. Ct. 1041, 140 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">When there is no express dedication for public use and the requisite intent must be implied, the acts relied upon to establish such dedication must be such as clearly showed a purpose on the part of the owner to abandon the owner's own personal dominion over such property, and to devote the property to a definite public use.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Question of value is sole issue for jury on appeal.</b> - While all issues may be raised in an appeal from the assessors' award, the question of value is the sole issue to be submitted to the jury, and its fact-finding powers are limited to those facts directly touching on value. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., 123 Ga. App. 695, 182 S.E.2d 160 (1971).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>There are only two elements of damages to be considered in condemnation proceeding:</b> first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of it to the purposes for which it is condemned.

<p class="p6"><b>Measure of damages is pecuniary loss sustained by owner.</b> - The measure of damages for property taken by the right of eminent domain, being compensatory in its nature, is the pecuniary loss sustained by the owner, taking into consideration all relevant factors. Ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be the fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof.

<p class="p6"><b>Property is "unique" when fair market value will not afford just compensation.</b> - Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" such that fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when they are not of type generally bought or sold in the open market.

<p class="p6"><b>Expert testimony on impact of temporary easement and value.</b> - In a condemnation action, an expert was properly allowed to testify that a temporary easement had not diminished the fair market value of the land.

<p class="p6"><b>This procedure affords due process of law</b> to the railroad companies whose property is sought to be condemned. Savannah, Fla. &amp; W. Ry. v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 115 Ga. 554, 42 S.E. 1 (1902); Western &amp; Atl. R.R. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 138 Ga. 420, 75 S.E. 471, 42 L.R.A. (n.s.) 225 (1912). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The necessity for taking private property for public use is a question for legislative determination, and the provisions relating to such taking are not, because they fail to provide for a special tribunal to pass upon such necessity, violative of the constitutional prohibition against taking the property without due process of law. Savannah, Fla. &amp; W. Ry. v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 115 Ga. 554, 42 S.E. 1 (1902).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Failure to provide for appeal does not render statute unconstitutional.</b> - Although a statute authorizing exercise of eminent domain may not provide for appeal from the award of the assessors, it is not, for this reason, unconstitutional.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Party with right to condemn has large discretion in selection of particular property</b> to be condemned; therefore, in the absence of bad faith, the determination by the condemnor of reasonable necessity for acquiring the condemnee's land cannot be disturbed by a court on appeal. Harwell v. Georgia Power Co., 154 Ga. App. 142, 267 S.E.2d 769, aff'd, 246 Ga. 203, 269 S.E.2d 464 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Telegraph company does not acquire fee, but only easement in right of way</b> of a railway company condemned for the purpose of constructing a telegraph line; the easement embraces land actually occupied by poles and fixtures for guy wires, the right to stretch wires on poles, and to enter upon right of way to construct and repair telegraph line. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 120 Ga. 268, 48 S.E. 15, 1 Ann. Cas. 734 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Proposed telegraph line must produce no material interference with railroad operation.</b> - A telegraph company may condemn a right of way on and along the right of way of a railroad company, when the proposed line of telegraph will be so constructed as to produce no material interference with the railroad company's free exercise of its franchise or with the actual operation of the railroad. Western &amp; Atl. R.R. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 138 Ga. 420, 75 S.E. 471, 42 L.R.A. (n.s.) 225 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Value of right of way for other uses cannot be considered.</b> - In arriving at the value of the land actually appropriated, the general salable value of the right of way for other uses than that to which it is applied by the railway company cannot be considered; the appropriation to public use amounts to a withdrawal of the right of way from any use except that which is necessary or ancillary to the operation of the railroad.

<p class="p6"><b>Peculiar advantages of right of way not proper element of damages.</b> - That the right of way may possess peculiar advantages and benefits to the telegraph company in the construction and maintenance of its line is not a proper element in the estimate of damages.

<p class="p6"><b>Section grants power of eminent domain to corporate utilities.</b> - The power of eminent domain is inherent in the sovereign state, but lies dormant until granted by act of the legislature; under the provisions of this section, corporate utilities supplying electric power to the public have been granted the power of eminent domain. Harwell v. Georgia Power Co., 154 Ga. App. 142, 267 S.E.2d 769, aff'd, 246 Ga. 203, 269 S.E.2d 464 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Determination of "public use".</b> - Whether a purpose is a public or private purpose within the meaning of the law relating to eminent domain does not depend on use or the amount of use by the public, but upon the right of the public to such use. Rogers v. Toccoa Elec. Power Co., 163 Ga. 919, 137 S.E. 272 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Foreign corporation domesticated in Georgia has right to condemn land.</b> - A corporation chartered in another state with the right to own and operate an electric plant and engage in the business of generating, transmitting, and selling electricity for commercial and domestic use, and later domesticated in this state by appropriate proceedings, has the right to condemn the land of others for the purpose of running its lines or wires over the land and using and maintaining poles and appliances thereon in order to distribute electric current to the public from its plant. Perry v. Folkston Power Co., 181 Ga. 527, 183 S.E. 58 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">A foreign corporation owning or controlling water power in this state, when domesticated under the laws of Georgia, can exercise the right of eminent domain in this state for the purposes mentioned in this section.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Effect of county ordinance impeding rights under section.</b> - Pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-201(b)(9), the electric corporation, which had to condemn property in order to effectuate its project, did not have to demonstrate to the county the necessity or the appropriateness of its proposed project; thus, the county ordinance prohibiting the electric lines for three years was unconstitutional. Rabun County v. Ga. Transmission Corp., 276 Ga. 81, 575 S.E.2d 474 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Forsyth County, Ga., Unified Development Code <span class="s1">§§</span> 21-6.1 and 21-6.5, were defective because they required a utility to successfully comply with the ordinance's procedures, and authorized the county to deny "any or all" portions of an application; as such, they were unconstitutional infringements on the utility's legislatively-delegated power of eminent domain. Forsyth County v. Ga. Transmission Corp., 280 Ga. 664, 632 S.E.2d 101 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Eminent domain power not lost through furnishing power in another state.</b> - A corporation having the power of eminent domain would not lose such power because it also furnished electric power in Tennessee.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice to owner required.</b> - Preliminary to the exercise of the power granted by this section, for the purpose of erecting an electric line with necessary poles and fixtures, it is incumbent upon the power company to serve a notice on the owner of the property sought to be condemned, which notice shall describe the property with the same definiteness as is required in a deed of conveyance of land. Gunn v. Georgia Power Co., 205 Ga. 85, 52 S.E.2d 449 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>In proceeding under this section sole question for assessors is amount of compensation to be paid;</b> the assessors cannot pass upon the legal power of the company to institute such proceedings.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Injunction is proper remedy to determine power of eminent domain.</b> The remedy of the landowner who seeks to challenge the legal power of a company to condemn is to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the condemnation proceedings if they are unauthorized. Rogers v. Toccoa Power Co., 161 Ga. 524, 131 S.E. 517, 44 A.L.R. 534 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Injunction is proper remedy for questioning legality of corporation's charter.</b> Rogers v. Toccoa Power Co., 161 Ga. 524, 131 S.E. 517, 44 A.L.R. 534 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Owner who permits appropriation of land estopped from ejectment or injunction.</b> - If a landowner stands by and permits, without legal objection, a public utility company to appropriate the landowner's land to its necessary corporate use until such becomes a necessary and constituent part of its service to the public, and the rights of the public intervene to such extent that to oust the company would interrupt the service and deny it to the public, the landowner, not for the protection so much of the company but for the benefit of the public, will be estopped from recovering the land in ejectment from enjoining its use for the service, but will, if he moves in time, be remitted to an appropriate action for damages. Wiggins v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 245 Ga. 526, 266 S.E.2d 148 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Damage to other property from power lines on right of way.</b> - The power, telephone and telegraph companies all have the power of eminent domain, and could exercise that power to acquire the right to erect their lines upon the railroad's right of way. That they choose to acquire by contract such right, as against the railroad, does not render the railroad company liable for their alleged failure also to compensate the plaintiff for the taking or damaging of the plaintiff's property by their erection of power and communication lines on the railroad's right of way.

<p class="p11">The General Assembly finds and declares that the prompt and equitable relocation and reestablishment of persons, businesses, farmers, and nonprofit organizations displaced when the state, any of its agencies or institutions (other than the Department of Transportation), or any county, municipal corporation, school district, political subdivision, public authority, public agency, public corporation, or public instrumentality, excluding electric membership corporations as defined in paragraph (3) of Code Section 46-3-171, (collectively referred to in this chapter as "several public entities") created under the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia acquires land, with federal financial assistance, for a public use, are necessary to ensure that certain individuals do not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole. The General Assembly finds and declares that the establishment of uniform fair land acquisition policies will be beneficial to the public. The General Assembly finds that the Congress of the United States has, by enacting the Uniform Act, made funds available for relocation assistance and the implementation of certain land acquisition policies. The General Assembly further finds that the Congress of the United States has by the aforesaid statute provided for the total cessation after July 1, 1972, of federal financial assistance for public works projects which will displace persons or businesses unless the state complies with the requirements of the Uniform Act. The General Assembly finds and declares that the construction of public works projects with federal financial assistance is vital to the state and is in the best interest of the people of the state and that providing for the continuation of federal financial assistance at the highest possible level for public works projects is a legitimate public purpose. The General Assembly further finds that the cost of providing the assistance and services provided for in this chapter should be, and the same are declared to be, part of the necessary cost of federal-aid public works projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
