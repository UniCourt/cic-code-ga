<p class="p12"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 18-2-1 gives generic meaning of term "creditor."</b> - While generic meaning of term "creditor," was defined by former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3215 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-1), it was used in former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2220 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 14-4-63) in its more circumscribed and ordinary meaning as denoting a holder of an obligation arising ex contractu. Howard v. Long, 142 Ga. 789, 83 S.E. 852 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability for conversion included.</b> - Relationship of debtor and creditor is defined broader than is generally supposed, and would seem to include liability for wrongful conversion of property for which trover would lie. Banks v. McCandless, 119 Ga. 793, 47 S.E. 332 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability for trespass.</b> - Words "liable and bound by law to pay another an amount of money, certain or uncertain," certainly were broad enough to embrace a person liable to pay for trespass, and that before amount of trespass, or extent of damage, was ascertained; for the words were, "an amount of money, certain or uncertain." Powell v. Westmoreland, 60 Ga. 572 (1878).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relation between stock certificate holder and issuing association.</b> - True relation between holder of certificate of stock in loan and building association and association is neither more nor less than that of debtor and creditor. Cook v. Equitable Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 104 Ga. 814, 30 S.E. 911 (1898); Cashen v. Southern Mut. Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 114 Ga. 983, 41 S.E. 51 (1902).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to set aside fraudulent transfers.</b> - Former Civil Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 28-101, 28-102, 28-201, and 28-202 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-1, 18-2-20, 18-2-22 and 18-2-23 [see now, also, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-70]) provide creditors with the right to set aside fraudulent transfers, and this remedy was available to any creditor at time of transfer who thereafter reduces the creditor's claim to judgment lien. United States v. Hickox, 356 F.2d 969 (5th Cir. 1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Renunciation of lien privileges.</b> - Judgment creditor may lose, surrender, or waive benefit of creditor's lien by renunciation of privileges secured by such lien. Law v. Coleman, 173 Ga. 68, 159 S.E. 679 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Principal of dissolved corporate business still subject to unliquidated claim.</b> - Unliquidated tort claims by a customer against a car dealership survived as a debt owed to the customer by the principal of the dealership, to whom the dealership had conveyed the dealership's assets while insolvent; furthermore, the principal's responses to and filing of summary judgment motions, and participation in the lawsuit in other ways, waived any objections to the trial court's exercise of personal jurisdiction. Hodge v. Howes, 260 Ga. App. 107, 578 S.E.2d 904 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p12"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent behind this section and former </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 18-2-22.</b> - Construing former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§§</span> 1942 and 1943 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 18-2-22 (repealed) and 18-2-40) together, as being in pari materia, the intention of the legislature was that an insolvent debtor may assign property in trust, for the benefit of one or more of the debtor's creditors, to the exclusion of others, if it was done bona fide, and no trust or benefit was reserved to the assignor, or any person for the assignor. Embry &amp; Fisher v. Clapp, 38 Ga. 245 (1868).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discussion of effect of Ga. L. 1865-66, p. 29 on former Code 1882, </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 1953.</b> - See Powell, Brother &amp; Co. v. Kelly Brothers &amp; Porter, 82 Ga. 1, 9 S.E. 278, 3 L.R.A. 139 (1889).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Even an insolvent debtor may prefer one creditor to another,</b> and to this end the debtor may transfer choses in action as collateral security for preexisting debt, surplus in such case not being reserved for the debtor's own benefit. Suttles v. Vickery, 179 Ga. 751, 177 S.E. 714 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of pendency of suit.</b> - Mere pendency of suit against debtor does not extinguish debtor's right to prefer one creditor over another, and in such case, controlling question is "existence or nonexistence of fraud in the transfer." Suttles v. Vickery, 179 Ga. 751, 177 S.E. 714 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer to be made in good faith and not benefit debtor.</b> - Debtor is permitted to prefer one creditor over another and to make assignments to that end so long as the transfer is made in good faith and does not benefit the debtor. Bank of Cave Spring v. Gold Kist, Inc., 173 Ga. App. 679, 327 S.E.2d 800 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Means of accomplishing preference of one creditor over others.</b> - Insolvent debtor may give preference in a great variety of ways to one creditor to the exclusion of others, provided it be done with good faith. McWhorter v. Wright, Nichols &amp; Co., 5 Ga. 555 (1848).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insolvent debtor cannot assign all property for benefit of part of creditors.</b> - Assignment made by insolvent debtor of all debtor's property for benefit of part of creditors is not allowed by laws of this state, but one in debt may sell part of the debtor's property to pay one of the debtor's creditors. Bones v. Printup Bros. &amp; Co., 64 Ga. 753 (1880).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisites to valid preferential conveyance.</b> - Debtor may in good faith prefer one creditor to others by conveying property, even while insolvent, in total or partial payment of a debt, and without additional consideration, provided that such payment or credit represents the fair market value of the property or is not unreasonably disproportionate to such value; and provided that no secret trust or covert benefit, prohibited by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-301, was reserved to the debtor; and provided further that the intent of the debtor, known to the creditor, shall not be to hinder, delay, or defraud other creditors. Moncrief Furnace Co. v. Northwest Atlanta Bank, 193 Ga. 440, 19 S.E.2d 155 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intent as key in judging validity of preferential conveyance.</b> - Husband who is indebted to his wife may convey property to her in preference to other creditors; but this rule is subject to qualification that conveyance must be made only for purpose of paying or securing his wife as creditor, and not be tainted with any intention to hinder, delay, or defraud others, such conveyance being judged by intention with which it is made and accepted, and not by its consideration or effect. Cotton States Fertilizer Co. v. Childs, 179 Ga. 23, 174 S.E. 708 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it is true that "a debtor may prefer one creditor to another," and may convey property for this purpose, such right is subject to qualification that conveyance must be made only for purpose of paying or securing creditor so preferred, and not be tainted with any intentions to hinder, delay, or defraud others; such conveyance being judged by intention with which it is made and accepted, and not by its consideration or effect. Dickson v. Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., 184 Ga. 398, 191 S.E. 379 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Good faith conveyance for consideration to creditor before another creditor obtains judgment.</b> - Creditor may in good faith and for valuable consideration take from the creditor's debtor a deed to property before another creditor obtains judgment, and such a valid deed, even though improperly recorded or not recorded until after judgment, will not be subordinate thereto. Moncrief Furnace Co. v. Northwest Atlanta Bank, 193 Ga. 440, 19 S.E.2d 155 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Preference enabling one creditor to obtain advantageous judgment.</b> - Insolvent debtor may prefer one creditor to others by dividing debt which the debtor owes to that creditor into smaller debts so that they shall be within jurisdiction of court in which judgment may be obtained on them that shall be such as to give that creditor an advantage over others. Bank of Savannah v. Planters Bank, 22 Ga. 466 (1857); Andrews &amp; Co. v. Kaufmans, 60 Ga. 669 (1878).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mortgage by insolvent debtor to secure payment of preexisting debt.</b> - Mortgage, executed by insolvent debtor to secure payment of bona fide preexisting debt, is not per se fraudulent as against creditors. Davis v. Anderson, 1 Ga. 176 (1846); Lee v. Brown, 7 Ga. 275 (1849).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Partner's sale of share of partnership assets to pay individual indebtedness.</b> - Under this section and the law generally, each partnership member has the right, with consent of a partner, to sell the partner's share in firm assets in payment of the partner's individual indebtedness. Ellison &amp; Son v. Lucas &amp; McDuffie, 87 Ga. 223, 13 S.E. 445, 27 Am. St. R. 242 (1891).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of stock of goods to extinguish debt.</b> - Former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2697 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-40) was not repealed by the former Bulk Sales Act (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-6-101 et seq.), but the sale of a stock of goods in extinguishment of a debt, in whole or in part, was permissible, if the Bulk Sales Act was complied with.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of Act.</b> - Former Ga. L. 1880-81, p. 174 was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>remedial in nature and should be strictly construed against the assignor and assignee, and liberally in favor of the creditors. Turnipseed v. Schaefer, 76 Ga. 109, 2 Am. St. R. 15 (1886) (decided under former Ga. L. 1880-81, p. 174).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of noncompliance.</b> - Former Ga. L. 1880-81, p. 174 was mandatory and assignment by an insolvent debtor for the benefit of creditors is void and conveyed no title when no schedule or inventory was attached to the deed of assignment. Crittenden Bros. v. Coleman &amp; Co., 70 Ga. 293 (1883); Crittenden Bros. v. Coleman &amp; Co., 74 Ga. 331 (1884) (decided under former Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specificity of schedules.</b> - It is essential to rights of creditors that schedule of property assigned be made out specifically, so that it may be seen if assignment covers property sold by them, and whether, by reason of fraud in debtor, they can claim title thereto. Crittenden Bros. v. Coleman &amp; Co., 70 Ga. 293 (1883) (decided under former Ga. L. 1880-81, p. 174).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Inventory and schedule need not state values of property listed.</b> - It is not essential to validity of deed of assignment that values should be affixed to items of property included in inventory and schedule thereto attached. Anthony v. Price &amp; Maas, 92 Ga. 170, 17 S.E. 1024 (1893) (decided under former Ga. L. 1880-81, p. 174).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability.</b> - Fraudulent Conveyance Act applied to conveyance of own property intended to delay or defraud, known to taker. Jones v. Foster, 150 Ga. 277, 103 S.E. 491 (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3224). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Before conveyance by insolvent debtor can be attacked by debtor's creditor, it must appear that the insolvent debtor actually parted with some valuable asset which belonged to the debtor, and which, if title had been retained, might have been subjected to debts. S.T. &amp; W.A. Dewees Co. v. Paul B. Carter &amp; Co., 190 Ga. 68, 8 S.E.2d 376 (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">As to claims against one corporation whose property has been purchased by another, the general law would apply, prohibiting any transaction in fraud of creditors, and preventing an assignment by an insolvent wherein it or stockholders reserved any benefit or trust. Hawkins v. Central of Ga. Ry., 119 Ga. 159, 46 S.E. 82 (1903) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2695); White v. Atlanta, B. &amp; A.R.R., 5 Ga.

<p class="p4">Former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22 did not apply to an assent to probate of a will since such assent did not operate as an assignment or conveyance of any property interest subject to execution or levy by the plaintiff because the plaintiff's judgment was not entered until several months after the assent was given.

<p class="p4">Word "others" as used in the phrase "creditors and others" includes plaintiffs with claims against debtors "liable as tortfeasors, or otherwise . . . for an unascertained damage to person or property, so far as fraudulent conveyances are concerned."

<p class="p4"><b>Conditions for transfer invalid.</b> - Transfer is invalid against creditors, and therefore a trustee in bankruptcy if: (1) debtor conveys property with intent to delay or defraud debtor's creditors; and (2) recipient of property knows of debtor's intention to defraud. Loeb v. Dante, 1 Bankr. 547 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1979) (decided under former Code 1933, 28-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Invalidation.</b> - Invalidation is permitted whenever: (1) bona fide creditor of debtor exists at time of transfer; (2) debtor and transferee intended conveyance as a gift rather than a sale; and (3) debtor is insolvent at time of transfer or rendered insolvent as a result of transfer. Loeb v. Dante, 1 Bankr. 547 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of "delay."</b> - "Delay" cannot be construed to include situations in which debtor files reorganization petition in bankruptcy and obtains protection of automatic stay to suspend creditors from recovering possession of collateral; the automatic stay of an otherwise proper petition is not a delay prohibited or contemplated. Chattanooga Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Northwest Recreational Activities, Inc., 4 Bankr. 36 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between equitable and legal remedies.</b> - Equitable remedy of setting aside the conveyance for satisfaction of the original debt is completely different from the right at law to recover damages for the fraud of the conveyance itself, and judgment creditors are not required to give up their right to satisfy the judgment debt by getting the conveyance set aside, in order to get damages for the fraud. Kesler v. Veal, 182 Ga. App. 444, 356 S.E.2d 254, modified on other grounds, 257 Ga. 677, 362 S.E.2d 214 (1987) (decided under former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Remedy available to one reducing claim to judgment lien.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 28-101, 28-102, 28-201, and 28-202 provided creditors with the right to set aside fraudulent transfers, and this remedy was available to any creditor at the time of transfer who thereafter reduces the creditor's claim to a judgment lien. United States v. Hickox, 356 F.2d 969 (5th Cir. 1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 28-101, 28-102, 28-201, and 28-202 ).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time of acquisition of lien.</b> - Creditor, who brings suit to prevent a debtor from carrying into effect a threat to convey away all of the debtor's property for purpose of defeating claims of such creditor, acquires a lien from commencement of suit to prevent such fraudulent conveyance, and after service of process. Law v. Coleman, 173 Ga. 68, 159 S.E. 679 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Status of trustee in bankruptcy.</b> - Condition precedent to filing action was that only judgment creditors can void certain acts. Section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides trustee with status of a hypothetical judgment creditor. Therefore, this condition precedent is satisfied in suit by trustee alleging fraudulent conveyance of real property by debtor to debtor's spouse. Pettigrew v. Graham, 16 Bankr. 606 (Bankr. N.D.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remedy under bankruptcy law.</b> - When a creditor has been injured by fraudulent or other willful misconduct by the debtor, the appropriate remedy under bankruptcy law as to the debtor is an exception to or a denial of a discharge. As to another creditor which may have willfully participated in the misconduct, the appropriate remedy under bankruptcy law is an adjudication of the relative priorities between the wrongdoer and the other innocent creditors. Sandersville Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Douthit, 47 Bankr. 428 (M.D. Ga. 1985) (decided under former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Denial of discharge in bankruptcy.</b> - Determination that bankruptcy debtor made the subject transfers to the debtor's wife in an intentional effort to perpetrate fraud and conceal assets may constitute a sufficient legal basis for denying the debtor's discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 727(a)(2)(A). Sikes v. Norton, 185 Bankr. 945 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1995) (decided under former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Right of trustee in bankruptcy to avoid transfer.</b> - Trustee in bankruptcy may avoid any transfer of property by bankrupt which any creditor of bankrupt might have avoided; and this right of trustee extends to all transfers made and accepted in fraud of creditors, regardless of whether transactions occurred within four months prior to bankruptcy or not. Sullivan v. Ginsberg, 180 Ga. 840, 181 S.E. 163 (1935) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>In spite of fraudulence of conveyance, subsequent creditor who sustains no harm is denied relief.</b> - One may make a conveyance with actual intent to defraud future creditor or to defeat debt which, though contemplated, is not yet in actual existence; and, unless creditor is hurt by such conveyance, relief will be denied. Roach v. Roach, 212 Ga. 40, 90 S.E.2d 423 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

McGahee, 204 Ga. 91, 48 S.E.2d 675 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conveyances in pursuance of common scheme.</b> - Fact that value of property covered by several conveyances was largely in excess of debt due petitioner did not afford ground for demurrer as all of the conveyances were executed in pursuance of a common scheme and could be attacked without reference to the amount of the judgment creditor's debt as compared to the value of property conveyed. Peoples Loan Co. v. Allen, 199 Ga. 537, 34 S.E.2d 811 (1945) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Deed to secure debt also subject to attack.</b> - Conveyance of property for present valuable consideration may be void as to creditors and a deed to secure debt is as much open to attack for fraud as an absolute conveyance.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action in rem by alimony obligee against fraudulently conveyed property.</b> - Willful failure to provide for maintenance and support of spouse and children creates lawful demand which, when legally enforced, is called alimony, and is a debtor/creditor relationship. Thus, when spouse was creditor at time of conveyances which are alleged to have been made to defeat her claim for alimony, although no alimony judgment had been rendered at time of conveyances, it would be inequitable and unjust not to allow her to maintain action because she elected to obtain judgment in rem against husband's property when she was unable to obtain personal service because of his willful avoidance of service. Carter v. Bush, 216 Ga. 429, 116 S.E.2d 568 (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 28-101 - 28-104, and 28-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment for damages may be appropriate.</b> - When plaintiff alleges that the defendant transferred and conveyed property to parties unknown, and that the property is now beyond the defendant's control, it would not be inappropriate to allow judgment for such damages as creditors may have sustained, not exceeding value of property.

Harper v. Atlanta Milling Co., 203 Ga. 608, 48 S.E.2d 89 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 28-104 and 28-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Grantor and first taker of stock not indispensable parties.</b> - In a fraudulent conveyance action against the grantee of stock brought by a divorced wife who was awarded the stock in the divorce proceeding, the grantor, husband, and first taker, a corporation, were not indispensable parties since neither was necessary for a just adjudication of the merits of the action, and neither was required for complete relief.

<p class="p12"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Circumstantial evidence may be of high importance.</b> - When a conveyance, a security deed, or a mortgage is attacked as having been made to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors of the maker of such instrument, circumstantial evidence is of the highest importance in determining the good faith or bad faith - the real intent - of the grantor in the execution of the instrument; direct testimony as to the real intent of the grantor and grantee whose motives are under attack can only be obtained from these interested persons, and consequently necessarily any circumstance that may throw light on their conduct and motive is admissible for the jury's consideration. Gower v. Cohn, 643 F.2d 1146 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Facts necessary for conclusive presumption of fraud.</b> - Only facts necessary to render deed from husband to wife fraudulent in law are indebtedness, insolvency of debtor, and voluntariness of deed. When these facts are proved, the law conclusively presumes fraudulent intent and declares instrument void so far as creditors who held demands against the debtor at the time of conveyance are concerned. Chambers v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 242 Ga. 498, 249 S.E.2d 214 (1978) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-201); Barclay v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of general character of alleged fraud perpetrator.</b> - When conveyance between near relatives is attacked upon ground of fraud, the law requires jury to examine every circumstance with care and caution, and one who is charged with defrauding honest creditors should be allowed to introduce evidence concerning one's general character. Wimberly v. Toney, 175 Ga. 416, 165 S.E. 257 (1932) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of indebtedness.</b> - Testamentary trust created by a wife in favor of her husband was not a fraudulent transfer against a judgment creditor since the wife had been released from liability on the judgment by virtue of a settlement agreement executed in bankruptcy court and, thus, creation of the trust was not a debtor's act that could be deemed fraudulent against the creditor under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22.

<p class="p4"><b>Unexplained agreement that grantor retain possession.</b> - Agreement between a grantor and grantee that property shall remain in possession of vendor, if not satisfactorily explained, is a badge of fraud; and when such continued possession in vendor is shown, the burden of proof shifts to grantee.

<p class="p4"><b>Issues regarding execution of release.</b> - When the exclusion in a liability policy for injuries or death caused by assault or battery applied to a claim against the insured arising from an assault and battery caused by its employee, there was no coverage under the policy, and a release by the insured of any claims it might have against the insurer did not transfer a valuable asset to the insurer in violation of this statute. Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Dunn, 269 Ga. 213, 496 S.E.2d 696 (1998) (decided under former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant did not have to be indebted to plaintiff.</b> - Read and considered as a whole, a jury charge was an accurate statement of the law and was authorized by the evidence in an action in which the jury was instructed that it was not necessary for a defendant to be indebted to a plaintiff at the time of a transfer for former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22 to apply and there was evidence that an attorney made a conveyance with actual intent to defraud a future creditor, a client; moreover, the trial court fully and completely charged the law on fraudulent conveyances, including former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22(2).

<p class="p4"><b>Aiding and abetting.</b> - Although Georgia courts had not yet had an opportunity to address the issue of whether there was a cause of action for aiding and abetting a fraudulent transfer when the alleged aider-abetter was not a debtor or a transferee, the instant court concluded that Georgia courts were not likely to recognize such an action; the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(now Uniform Voidable Transactions Act), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-70 et seq., did not refer to parties other than debtors, creditors, and transferees, and further there was no language in UFTA that suggested the creation of a distinct cause of action for aiding and abetting claims against non-transferees.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Case improperly dismissed for failure to state a claim.</b> - Trial court erred in granting the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because it was too soon in the case to conclude, as a matter of law, that the plaintiffs could not present evidence satisfying the statutory elements of O.C.G.A. <span class="s2">Ý</span> 18-2-70 et. seq., seeking to void the transfer of assets.

<p class="p4"><b>Transfer was not fraudulent.</b> - When a corporation paid a dividend to a shareholder pursuant to a shareholders agreement after designating itself an S corporation, it was not a fraudulent transfer because it was not error to find that the transfer was made in exchange for reasonably equivalent value since the shareholders agreement provided the corporation with valuable benefits by virtue of its S-corporation election.

<p class="p4"><b>No fraud shown by developer.</b> - In an action brought by the purchasers of a lot seeking to cancel the developer's security deed based upon alleged fraud, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the developer as, even if the developer knew of the sale of the lot to the purchasers, such sale did not estop the developer from the developer's claim against the lot pursuant to the developer's security deed; however, the trial court did err by denying the equitable subrogation claim asserted by the purchasers' lender since exercising subrogation did not prejudice the developer in any manner.

<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment improper.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to a creditor because under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-75(b), the questioned real estate transfer involved the debtor purchasing the property for the debtor's mother because the debtor had the right to purchase the property and it was only deeded to the debtor briefly the same day, which transfer was not to satisfy an antecedent debt, thus, no fraudulent transfer occurred.

<p class="p4">Transferees were not entitled to summary judgment on a Chapter 7 trustee's claim to avoid transfers as actually fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Georgia law as the transferees failed to demonstrate by either affirmative evidence or by pointing to lack of evidence that the trustee could not carry the trustee's burden at trial regarding the debtor's intent to transfer the debtor's assets. Rather, several badges of fraud existed, including that the debtor made the transfer to an insider (a company wholly owned by a director of the debtor who owned more than 20 percent of the stock of the debtor) and that the transfer was made for the purpose of satisfying an antecedent debt owed to an insider.

<p class="p4">Evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict under the plaintiff's theory of fraudulent transfer and civil conspiracy as some evidence authorized the jury to find that a deed conveying the property owner's sole interest to the real property to the owner and one defendant as joint tenants with right of survivorship without any money exchanged prior to death was to evade the plaintiff before a promissory note was paid.

Subsection (b) states that, in determining actual intent, the court could consider a specified list of factors among other factors, which track the badges of fraud identified by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intentional fraud.</b> - Plaintiff established prima facie case of intentional fraud sufficient to trigger Georgia's fraudulent transfer law because the plaintiff provided evidence showing that the transaction resulted in transfer of substantially all assets, transferring company became insolvent shortly after transfer, transfer occurred just before potential lawsuit against transferring company became known, shareholders of transferring company simply switched over to company to whom assets transferred, and some evidence existed that efforts were made to conceal the nature of the transfer.

<p class="p4"><b>Assignee of debt could bring fraudulent transfer claim.</b> - Judgment creditor had standing to pursue the creditor's claim against a judgment debtor and the debtor's transferees, although the judgment creditor was the assignee of the debt leading to the judgment, because it did not seek a remedy for an injury to the previous holder of the note, but for an injury that was committed directly against it; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-12-24 did not apply.

<p class="p4"><b>Right of action for injuries arising from fraud cannot be assigned.</b> - An assignee of debt is precluded from pursuing a fraudulent transfer claim even though the assignee met the definitions of a creditor with a claim under the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (now the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-70 et seq., because the non-assignment statute provides that a right of action for injuries arising from fraud cannot be assigned; thus, the second assignee had no standing to assert a fraudulent transfer claim against the appellee regarding two parcels of real property because a fraudulent transfer claim could not be assigned under Georgia law. RES-GA Hightower, LLC v. Golshani, 334 Ga. App. 176, 778 S.E.2d 805 (2015), cert. denied, No. S16C0330, 2016 Ga. LEXIS 54 (Ga. 2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court granted a motion for default judgment and denied Chapter 7 debtor's discharge when the well-pled allegations of the complaint established that post-petition, the debtor liquidated the debtor's 401(k) account and spent or transferred proceeds without authority from the court and with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors or officers of the debtor's bankruptcy estate. The court inferred the debtor's fraudulent intent based on badges of fraud under Georgia fraudulent conveyance statute, including that the debtor did not fully disclose the value of the account; the debtor transferred a portion of the funds to the debtor's mother and daughter, who were insiders; funds were substantially all of the debtor's assets; and the debtor transferred a portion of the funds without adequate consideration.

<p class="p4">Because the 2015 amendments to the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (now the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-70 et seq., specifically allowed assignees and successors to debt to pursue fraudulent transfer claims, it follows that under the previous version of the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, such assignments were not allowed. RES-GA Hightower, LLC v. Golshani, 334 Ga. App. 176, 778 S.E.2d 805 (2015), cert. denied, No. S16C0330, 2016 Ga. LEXIS 54 (Ga. 2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though the four-year statute of limitations under the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA) (now the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-70 et seq., had not expired, a Chapter 7 trustee's avoidance action, which was brought pursuant to a Bankruptcy Code provision allowing the trustee to step into the shoes of an unsecured creditor, was barred by the two-year limitations period in the Bankruptcy Code. Nor was the statute tolled by a Bankruptcy Code provision dealing with extensions of time as the trustee's fraudulent transfer action was brought standing in the shoes of a creditor, not the debtor.

<p class="p4"><b>Void as to creditor not void ab initio.</b> - When a bank sought relief from the automatic stay to proceed with a sheriff's sale under a prepetition state court consent judgment that resolved a fraudulent transfer action against the debtor and others by declaring the transfer "void," the court denied the motion as unnecessary. No interest in the property revested in the debtor because, applying rules of contract construction to the consent judgment, and giving the consent judgment a construction that rendered it in compliance with Georgia fraudulent transfer statutes, the court determined that the word "void" meant void as to the bank, not void ab initio.

<p class="p4">Trustee's pleadings that alleged that the investors used the debtors as part of a Ponzi scheme and that the money transferred to the limited liability company amounted to a fraudulent transfer was sufficient to meet the pleading requirements of Fed.

<p class="p4">Chapter 7 trustee's allegations were sufficient to survive a creditor's motion to dismiss the trustee's complaint seeking to avoid and recover transfers pursuant to 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§§</span> 544(b)(1) and 550 when the trustee alleged sufficient facts to suggest that, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-74(b), the creditor received avoidable fraudulent transfers from the debtor. The trustee alleged that all of the transfers were made within four years of the petition date, that the transfers were from the debtors' bank account, and that several badges of fraud indicated the debtors' actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud including the fact that the transfers occurred when the debtors were insolvent, the creditor was an insider of the debtors at the time of the transfers, and the creditor knew or should have known that the debtors were involved in an unlawful scheme to defraud investors.

June 21, 2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court rejected transferees' argument that a Chapter 7 trustee could not plausibly assert the existence of a creditor with an allowed claim that gave the creditor standing under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 544(b)(1) to assert a constructively fraudulent transfer claim under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-74 and Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, <span class="s1">§</span> 1304 because the assertion that only an unsecured creditor with a claim arising prior to the transfers could seek their avoidance was legally flawed. Under the state statutes, a transfer for less than reasonably equivalent value was constructively fraudulent as to creditors whose claims arose after the transfers when the debtor was engaged or was about to engage in a business or transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction. Watson v. Powell (In re Atlantis Plastics, Inc.),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga.

<p class="p4">When an investor asserted a fraudulent transfer claim against a bank to which a consultant who allegedly defrauded the investor made a down payment on a house, it was error to dismiss the claim based on the bank's assertion that the bank, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-74(a)(1), took the consultant's funds in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value because: (1) the investor's complaint did not admit or otherwise demonstrate such an affirmative defense; and (2) the investor had no obligation to anticipate the affirmative defense. Furthermore, the claims could survive a motion to dismiss because the investor: (1) stated viable claims; (2) did not have to anticipate affirmative defenses; and (3) did not admit such defenses. Speedway Motorsports, Inc. v. Pinnacle Bank, 315 Ga. App. 320, 727 S.E.2d 151 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trustee could not prevail under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-74 because the trustee was not a "creditor" who was able to utilize <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-74. Here, the trustee did not plead that the trustee was moving under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 544; rather, the trustee simply asserted a state law cause of action. Cooper v.

<p class="p4">Actual fraud was adequately pled by alleging badges of fraud sufficient to infer the fraudulent nature of transfers to insiders; moreover, insolvency resulting in constructive fraud also was adequately pled.

<p class="p4">Transferees were not entitled to summary judgment on a Chapter 7 trustee's claim to avoid transfers as actually fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Georgia law as the transferees failed to demonstrate by either affirmative evidence or by pointing to lack of evidence that the trustee could not carry the trustee's burden at trial regarding the debtor's intent to transfer the debtor's assets. Rather, several badges of fraud existed, including that the debtor made the transfer to an insider (a company wholly owned by a director of debtor who owned more than 20 percent of the stock of the debtor) and that the transfer was made for the purpose of satisfying an antecedent debt owed to an insider. Howell v. Fulford (In re Southern Home &amp; Ranch Supply,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inc.), 515 Bankr. 699 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bankruptcy trustee failed to allege that payments to a creditor were avoidable as fraudulent since the bankruptcy debtor incurred the obligation upon execution of an agreement which occurred outside the look-back period for avoiding fraudulent transfers.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-202 and former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-23 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Basis of right to set aside fraudulent transfers.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 28-101, 28-102, 28-201 and 28-202 provided creditors with a right to set aside fraudulent transfers, and this remedy was available to any creditor at time of transfer who thereafter reduced their claim to a judgment lien. United States v. Hickox, 356 F.2d 969 (5th Cir. 1966) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 28-202).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction in pari materia with other statutes.</b> - Former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3224 and 3225, being in pari materia, were to be construed together. Warren v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 145 Ga. 503, 89 S.E. 520 (1916) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3225). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fraudulent conveyance statute, former <span class="s1">§§</span> 18-2-22 and 18-2-23 should be considered in pari materia. FDIC v. United States, 654 F. Supp. 794 (N.D. Ga. 1986) (decided under former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-23).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Good faith for value" defense applies differently to 11 U.S.C. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 548 and state law claims.</b> In particular: (i) under <span class="s1">§</span> 548(c), regardless of the type of fraud, the transfer is not avoidable if the transferee took for value and in good faith to the extent of the value given; (ii) with respect to actual fraud under state law, the transfer is not avoidable if the transferee took for reasonably equivalent value and in good faith under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-78(a); and (iii) in contrast, with respect to constructive fraud under state law, there is no defense to avoidability, but the transferee's liability is reduced to the extent it gave value to the debtor in good faith under <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-78(d)(3).

<p class="p4"><b>One induced to sell goods to a bankrupt by fraud cannot reclaim from trustee.</b> In re Whatley Bros., 199 F. 326 (N.D. Ga. 1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3225).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impoundment of unpaid purchase money from sale.</b> - If the fraudulent grantee sells to an innocent purchaser, any unpaid purchase money due on such sale will be impounded as an equitable asset of the debtor for the distribution to the debtor's creditors. Beasley v. Smith, 144 Ga. 377, 87 S.E. 293 (1915) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3225).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suspicion alone insufficient.</b> - Contrary to the trial court's conclusion, reasonable grounds for suspicion alone do not suffice to render a subsequent purchaser's title void, and when the buyer acquired the automobile for value, and had no notice that the seller's title was obtained through fraud, the buyer received good title. Hall v. Hidy, 263 Ga. 422, 435 S.E.2d 215 (1993) (decided under former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-23).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge that grounds to suspect fraud in grantor's acquisition vitiates conveyance.</b> - It was error to charge that purchaser from one who is fraudulent grantee takes no title as against creditors if the individual<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has grounds to reasonably suspect fraud in conveyance to the grantor. Hinkle v. James Smith &amp; Son, 133 Ga. 255, 65 S.E. 427 (1909) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2695).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Protection of trustee and contingent beneficiary.</b> - When it was clearly evident that both the trustee and the contingent beneficiary of a trust had reasonable grounds to suspect that the purpose of the second security deed against certain property and the assignment thereof to the trust, at least in part, was done with the intent of the assignor to delay or defraud creditors in violation of former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-22(2), neither the trustee nor the beneficiary was a subsequent purchaser entitled to the protections of former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-23. FDIC v. United States, 654 F. Supp. 794 (N.D. Ga. 1986) (decided under former <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-23).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasonably equivalent value.</b> - Bankruptcy court rejected a Chapter 11 trustee's argument that investors who received payments from affiliated businesses that were accused of operating a Ponzi scheme did not give value for the payments and could not assert a defense under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 548(c) or Georgia law against the trustee's action seeking recovery of those payments under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§§</span> 544(b) and 548(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B), and Georgia law, as fraudulent transfers. The investors had a claim for the return of principal the investors invested, based on fraud, the investors gave value for payments the investors received up to the amount of the principal the investors invested because the payments satisfied their claim, and their right to keep the payments did not depend on whether the investments the investors made were characterized as debt or equity. In re Int'l Mgmt. Assocs., LLC,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Dec. 1, 2009), aff'd, 661 F.3d 623 (11th Cir. 2011)(Unpublished). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an investor asserted a fraudulent transfer claim against a bank to which a consultant who allegedly defrauded the investor made a down payment on a house, it was error to dismiss the claim based on the bank's assertion that the bank, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-74(a)(1), took the consultant's funds in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value because: (1) the investor's complaint did not admit or otherwise demonstrate such an affirmative defense; and (2) the investor had no obligation to anticipate the affirmative defense. Speedway Motorsports, Inc. v. Pinnacle Bank, 315 Ga. App. 320, 727 S.E.2d 151 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfers were avoidable.</b> - There was no showing of transferees' good faith in fraudulent transfers from bankruptcy debtors since the lack of information from the debtors, the refusal of the debtors to allow transferees to conduct due diligence, and the usurious interest paid by the debtors clearly indicated that the transactions were fraudulent; thus, the transfers from bankruptcy debtors were avoidable. Kerr v. Audio Answers, Inc. (In re Christou),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Sept. 28, 2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages available.</b> - Georgia law allowing the recovery of general and punitive damages for fraudulent conveyances survived the enactment of Georgia's Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-70 et seq. Interfinancial Midtown, Inc. v. Choate Constr. Co., 343 Ga. App. 793, 806 S.E.2d 255 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Suit against non-transferees of property barred.</b> - Judgment creditor could seek relief under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (now Uniform Voidable Transactions Act), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-70 et seq., against the judgment debtor, as well as any recipient of the transfers the debtor made, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 18-2-77 and 18-2-78, but the creditor could not pursue the judgment debtor's mother and sister or their corporation because they did not receive any interest in the properties from the judgment debtor. RES-GA YPL, LLC v. Rowland, 340 Ga. App. 713, 798 S.E.2d 315 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment improper.</b> - Based on evidence of the sale of judgment debtors' business to their long-time close friends and evidence that the friends were aware that the business owed money, a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether the debtors transferred their assets with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud their creditor under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-74(a)(1). Therefore, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was reversed. Abbott Oil Co. v. Rogers, 302 Ga. App. 439, 691 S.E.2d 561 (2010), cert. denied, No. S10C1026, 2010 Ga. LEXIS 583 (Ga. 2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Creditor failed to show good faith under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-2-78 in receiving fraudulent transfers from a bankruptcy debtor as returns on the creditor's investments in the debtor's Ponzi scheme, and thus the creditor was not entitled to summary judgment; the creditor was an educated and sophisticated businessman and, despite the creditor's assertion that the creditor had no reason to doubt the debtor who previously brokered mortgages for the creditor, the facts that the creditor invested substantial funds, received no promissory notes, and was paid no interest were sufficient to indicate that the creditor should have been suspicious of the nature of the transactions. In re Christou v. Cressaty Metals, Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 18-2-78(e) was inapplicable to the transfer.</b> The transfer occurred as part of the Settlement Agreement after the transferee sued the debtor and, as such, the transferee did not enforce a security interest in compliance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code; moreover, there was not a segregated, discrete fund in which the transferee could have exercised the transferee's security interest.

<p class="p4"><b>Remedy when in personam jurisdiction unavailable.</b> - When no jurisdiction is obtained over the debtor's person, the remedy is a proceeding in rem, in that it proceeds against property in custody of court and the judgment binds such property only; but when jurisdiction of debtor's person is obtained, either by personal service or appearance, proceeding is ordinarily in personam, and a personal judgment is rendered without regard to the attachment.

<p class="p4"><b>Absent personal service, appearance, or replevy, in personam judgment is void.</b> - When the defendants were not personally served with notice of pendency of attachment, did not appear and defend, and did not give bond and security to replevy property attached, an in personam judgment against the defendants was accordingly erroneous. Broome v. Graham, 99 Ga. App. 682, 109 S.E.2d 824 (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 8-602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contents of notice.</b> - Written notice to the defendant that attachment was pending against the defendant stating the court to which attachment was returnable, and the time, and stating on what property attachment had been levied, was sufficient compliance with former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 3233 to authorize proceedings as in ordinary suit, especially if the defendant appeared and pleaded to the merits.

<p class="p4"><b>Administrator of defendant who dies pending attachment.</b> - If, pending attachment, the defendant dies, and the defendant's administrator was made party to the proceeding, and no notice was given, as provided by former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 3309, the administrator stood precisely as did the deceased defendant. The administrator may attack the validity of the attachment, and if the administrator's objection was good the whole proceeding fell. Ross v.

<p class="p4"><b>When defendant receives sufficient notice and fails to defend.</b> - When nonresident defendants in attachment were given sufficient notice to put the defendants upon inquiry in time to have defended, but failed to do so, the supreme court will not control decision of presiding judge in refusing to allow the defendants to open judgment rendered in an attachment case for purpose of pleading to merits. Steers &amp; Co. v. Morgan &amp; Armstrong, 66 Ga. 552 (1881) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 3309).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof.</b> - On trial of traverse, burden of proof is on plaintiff in attachment. Oliver v. Wilson, 29 Ga. 642 (1859) (decided prior to codification of this principle).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of evidence to sustain traverse after replevy of attached property.</b> - When ground of attachment is duly traversed, defendant is entitled to introduce evidence to sustain the defendant's traverse, and presiding justice errs in holding that it is too late to do this after the defendant has replevied property attached. Brumby v. Rickoff, 94 Ga. 429, 21 S.E. 232 (1894) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 3312).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Defendant in attachment does not waive traverse to the plaintiff's affidavit by afterwards pleading to the merits of the action.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of finding issue in defendant's favor.</b> - When issue on traverse is found in favor of the defendant, all defendant gains is that levy falls, and if judgment is obtained on merits the judgment does not date from time of levy, but the judgment would take lien on property attached as well as on other property from date of judgment only. Blakely Milling &amp; Trading Co. v. Thompson, 34 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Omission of description of property on attachment docket.</b> - Though entry on attachment docket respecting attachment upon land does not contain description of the property, it may not be taken advantage of by a claimant to the property who acquired the property under fraudulent circumstances. Deveney, Hood &amp; Co. v. Burton, 110 Ga. 56, 35 S.E. 268 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of lien of judgment creditor; limitation of judgment's scope.</b> - Lien of a judgment creditor is not a lien acquired by contract; but is given by law. The judgment creditor is not, therefore, in the position of a bona fide purchaser, and the judgment creditor's lien extends only to property levied upon which actually belongs to the defendant in attachment. Parker v. Boyd, 208 Ga. 829, 69 S.E.2d 760 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p12">When the plaintiff in attachment wishes to levy his attachment upon property in a different county from that in which the same is returnable, it shall be the duty of the judge issuing the attachment, upon the request of the plaintiff, his agent, or his attorney at law, to make out a copy or copies of the original attachment, bond, and affidavit and certify the same officially to be true copies. Upon delivery of the copies of the attachment, bond, and affidavit, as directed, to any officer of the county in which the property of the defendant is located, it shall be the duty of the officer forthwith to levy the attachment upon the property of the defendant located in that county and to return the attachment, with his actings and doings entered thereon, to the court to which the original attachment is returnable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p12"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of replevy bond.</b> - When property attached has been replevied, attachment is dissolved, bond is substituted for property, and the case stands as if the case had been founded on ordinary principles. Thompson v. Wright, 22 Ga. 607 (1857); Camp v. Cahn, 53 Ga. 558 (1875); Walter v. Kierstead, 74 Ga. 18 (1884); Woodbridge v. Drought, 118 Ga. 671, 45 S.E. 266 (1903); Watters v.

<p class="p4"><b>Action is in personam.</b> - Replevy bond converts suit from action in rem to action in personam authorizing a common-law judgment. Middlebrooks v. Carson, 23 Ga. App. 665, 99 S.E. 151 (1919). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Replevy bond, in converting action in rem to one in personam, is equivalent to appearance. Ubico Milling Co. v. Poythress, 29 Ga. App. 134, 113 S.E. 815 (1922). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When defendant in attachment personally appears, replevies property attached, and defends action on its merits, the case proceeds in all respects as an ordinary action in personam and, accordingly, when there was no evidence to support single ground of attachment alleged, and traverse to attachment was well taken, this was not ground for a new trial or for setting aside judgment entered against defendant on the merits. Patne v. Oliver, 96 Ga. App. 644, 101 S.E.2d 154 (1957) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 8-901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p12"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When grounds of attachment fail,</b> replevy bond, insofar as it is sought to bind sureties thereon, fails also; in such event there is no liability of sureties on the bond, but their remedy is by affidavit of illegality or, perhaps, by some collateral motion.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Validity of replevy bond is dependent upon validity of attachment;</b> and if attachment has been dismissed, no liability attaches against surety on the replevy bond, notwithstanding the plaintiff in attachment may, after obtaining jurisdiction in personam over the defendant, have proceeded with the suit and obtained a common-law judgment thereon against the defendant. Burnette v. Johnson, 38 Ga. App. 396, 144 S.E. 36 (1928).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal as to principal on ground of bankruptcy or death.</b> - Since liability of sureties depends upon that of principal, if principal is discharged on ground of bankruptcy or death, case should be dismissed as a whole.

<p class="p4">If, upon levy of attachment for purchase-money, defendant replevies property by giving bond and security as provided in former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5113, and if within four months after levy of such attachment, the defendant is adjudicated a bankrupt, the lien of attachment is void, and the principal debtor and surety on replevy bond are both discharged.

<p class="p4"><b>Bond taken for double the amount levied on sets limit.</b> - When bond is taken for double the amount of property levied on, and judgment in attachment case is for an amount greater than the bond, judgment should be entered on the bond to the extent of the bond, no more and no less. Wilson &amp; Co. v. Sims, 144 Ga. 685, 87 S.E. 890 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Bunn v. Gamble, 54 Ga. App. 417, 188 S.E. 257 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Ga. L. 1855-6, pp. 36, 37, former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§§</span> 4705, 4709, and former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 5265, 5268, and 5269, and Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Due process compliance.</b> - Garnishment in attachment must comply with defendant's due process rights under a valid garnishment statute. Coursin v. Harper, 144 Ga. App. 4, 240 S.E.2d 565 (1977) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Proceedings on garnishment in attachment which do not comply with statutory provisions violate defendant's due process rights under United States and Georgia Constitutions. Coursin v. Harper, 144 Ga. App. 4, 240 S.E.2d 565 (1977) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutional requirements for garnishment proceedings.</b> - See North Ga. Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 95 S. Ct. 719, 42 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1975) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment must be strictly pursued.</b> - Garnishment proceeding is a distinct suit against a separate party, and for an entirely new cause of action, and such proceeding, being purely statutory and in derogation of common law, must be strictly pursued.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No constitutional right to jury trial.</b> - Former Georgia garnishment law was a special statutory proceeding enacted subsequent to the first Georgia Constitution and was in derogation of the common law. Thus, a garnishment action was not a civil action of such a nature in which a trial by jury was guaranteed. Mull v. Mull, 167 Ga. App. 687, 307 S.E.2d 675 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. T. 18, C. 4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Ed. 2d 421 (1970) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5269).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reliance on officer's promise to notify garnishee when to answer.</b> - Promise by officer that the officer would notify garnishee when to answer, coupled with sheer ignorance on part of latter, was not an excuse.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to make timely answer.</b> - Garnishee cannot attack judgment for causes anterior to rendition when garnishee failed to make timely answer. Henderson v. Mutual Fertilizer Co., 150 Ga. 465, 104 S.E. 229 (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5269).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Bank account holder whose accounts contained funds that were exempt from garnishment had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the garnishment statute as there was a substantial likelihood the account holder would suffer future garnishment proceedings and the return of the account holder's previously garnished funds did not moot the action because the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception applied. Strickland v. Alexander, 772 F.3d 876 (11th Cir. 2014) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-60).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment is a purely statutory proceeding, and will not be extended</b> so as to reach money or property of the defendant not made subject thereto by statute. Hartsfield Co. v. Zakas Bakery, 50 Ga. App. 284, 177 S.E. 825 (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5272).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment proceedings are purely statutory,</b> in derogation of common law, and must be strictly pursued. Arnold v. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 47 Ga. App. 254, 170 S.E. 316 (1933) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Garnishment proceedings are purely statutory and cannot be extended to cases not enumerated in statute. Kirchman v. Kirchman, 212 Ga. 488, 93 S.E.2d 685 (1956) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As garnishment proceedings are purely statutory the proceedings cannot be extended to cases not enumerated in the statutes, and courts have no power to enlarge the remedy or hold under it property not made subject to process. Undercofler v. Brosnan, 113 Ga. App. 475, 148 S.E.2d 470 (1966) (decided under former law). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Process of garnishment issued upon any ground not authorized by statute is without authority of law, and judgment based upon it is binding upon no one. Undercofler v. Brosnan, 113 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of garnishment lien.</b> - Purpose of garnishment proceeding is to assure that property in hands of third party is held subject to order of the court until conflicting claims are adjudicated. It frequently has been held that a judgment creates no lien on choses in action belonging to the defendant. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., 177 Ga. 318, 170 S.E. 294 (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5273). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Garnishment lien is intended to reach something actually due the defendant and which the defendant could force the garnishee to pay. A.C. White Transf. &amp; Storage Co. v. Grady Mem.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment operates both on person of garnishee and on debt itself.</b> - Garnishment proceeding notifies the debtor not to pay the debt, operates to arrest the debt's payment, fixes a lien upon it, and ultimately subjects it to the plaintiff's claim. Thus, it operates both on the person of the garnishee and on the debt itself. In re Eidson, 6 Bankr. 613 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Ga. L. 1976, p. 1608, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment action properly allowed.</b> - Trial court did not err by allowing a garnishment action to proceed because the garnishor was not pursuing a reverse-piercing claim, or any other equitable action, against the garnishee, rather, the action arose from a garnishment action expressly authorized by law. Carrier411 Servs. v. Insight Tech., Inc., 322 Ga. App. 167, 744 S.E.2d 356 (2013) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-20).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment law not intended to violate existing contracts or restrain right to contract.</b> - Garnishee is bound by existing liens on property in the garnishee's hands, and while garnishment law is to prevent evasions and subterfuges, it does not intend to violate existing contracts or restrain right to contract, but is only intended to reach something actually due the defendant and which the defendant could recover personally. J. Austin Dillon Co. v. Edwards Shoe Stores, Inc., 53 Ga. App. 437, 186 S.E. 470 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-208).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Salespersons earnings not subject to garnishment.</b> - One who sells bread, cakes, and pastries for a baking company, receiving as remuneration therefore 10 percent of the cash purchase-price of all such products sold by that person, the company furnishing daily an automobile truck to haul and deliver the bread and pies, with the necessary gasoline to operate the truck, and also the necessary products for such salesperson to sell, it being the arrangement and agreement that at the end of each day the salesperson shall account to the company for the products sold that day, delivering to the company 90 percent of the cash sales, and all unsold bread, and retaining for the salesperson 10 percent thereof, does not earn any salary, wages, or other compensation for selling such bakery products as can be reached by or subjected to the process of garnishment served upon the baking company in proceedings against the salesperson. Hartsfield Co. v. Zakas Bakery, 50 Ga. App. 284, 177 S.E. 825 (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5273).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment lien attaches upon service of summons.</b> - Service of garnishment operates as an inchoate lien until judgment is rendered against garnishee. Such inchoate lien becomes a complete lien upon, and in virtue of, rendition of judgment against garnishee, after which time the legal rights of the creditor are fixed, dating from service of garnishment. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., 177 Ga. 318, 170 S.E. 294 (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5273). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Garnishing creditor has, as to any property, money, or effects of garnishee's debtor that may be caught in hands of garnishee, an inchoate lien, which arises on service of summons of garnishment. Shabaz v. Henn, 48 Ga. App. 441, 173 S.E. 249 (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5273). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Service of summons operates as a lien upon all garnishee's indebtedness to the defendant, and on all accruing indebtedness, which lien shall not be defeated by any payments to defendant or other arrangements between a defendant and a garnishee. J. Austin Dillon Co. v. Edwards Shoe Stores, Inc., 53 Ga. App. 437, 186 S.E. 470 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-201, as it read prior to revision by Ga. L. 1976, p. 1608, <span class="s1">§</span> 1). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Lien attaches to the garnished funds when the summons of garnishment is served. Ameron Protective Coatings Div. v. Georgia Steel, Inc., 25 Bankr. 781 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-20).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishee to whom defendant is indebted has lien superior to plaintiff in garnishment.</b> - If debtor is indebted to garnishee, the latter has a lien on funds coming into the garnishee's hands, or future indebtedness to the debtor, superior to that of the plaintiff in garnishment; the garnishee is entitled to pay oneself before the garnishee is required to collect for the benefit of others, and this applies to any past indebtedness due the garnishee by the defendant. W.C. Caye &amp; Co. v. Milledgeville Banking Co., 91 Ga. App. 664, 86 S.E.2d 717 (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-203 prior to revision by Ga. L. 1976, p. 1608, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When garnishing creditor obtains valid judgment, lien shall date from service of garnishment.</b> - Service of a summons of garnishment in all cases operates as a lien on the garnishee's indebtedness at the date of service, and upon all future indebtedness accruing up to date of answer, which lien is inchoate or incomplete; such inchoate lien becomes completed when the creditor obtains a valid judgment against the debtor and such lien shall date from service of garnishment. Anderson v. Ashford &amp; Co., 174 Ga. 660, 163 S.E. 741 (1932) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5273).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment by judgment creditor against defendant's insurer.</b> - After the parents of a shooting victim obtained a judgment against the owner of the property on which their son was shot, and the owner filed bankruptcy, the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court and holding that a judgment debtor had no garnishment action against the owner's insurer. Ross v. St. Paul Reinsurance Co., Ltd., 279 Ga. 92, 610 S.E.2d 57 (2005) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-20).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Service of summons more than four months before bankruptcy proceeding is effective.</b> - Service of summons of garnishment more than four months before proceeding in bankruptcy is filed creates a lien upon any property, money, or effects of debtor which may be caught in the hands of the garnishee. Light v. Hunt, 17 Ga. App. 491, 87 S.E. 763 (1916) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5272).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment may be classified as a proceeding quasi in rem.</b> - Statutory proceeding in garnishment strictly speaking is not a proceeding in rem. It partakes both of the nature of a proceeding in personam and a proceeding in rem and may be classified as a proceeding quasi in rem. In re Eidson, 6 Bankr. 613 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Ga. L. 1976, p. 1608, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 et seq.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State law controls</b> both procedures and extent to which wages may be garnished under 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 659(a). Williamson v. Williamson, 247 Ga. 260, 275 S.E.2d 42, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 669, 70 L.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of exclusive jurisdiction of bankruptcy court over debt.</b> - When debt upon which garnishment action is based came into exclusive jurisdiction of United States Bankruptcy Court prior to entry of judgment by state court, jurisdiction of state court over cause of action is preempted. In re Eidson, 6 Bankr. 613 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Ga. L. 1976, p. 1608, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 et seq.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Position of garnishing plaintiff with respect to garnishee</b> is no better than that of the defendant with respect to the garnishee. If the defendant personally could not obtain judgment against the garnishee, garnishing the plaintiff cannot do so. Gant, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 151 Ga. App. 212, 259 S.E.2d 485 (1979) (decided under former Ga. L. 1976, p. 1608, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 et seq.); Scarboro v. Ralston Purina Co., 160 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ascertainment of whether garnishee is indebted to or holds assets of defendant.</b> - In garnishment action, question as to whether such garnishee is or is not indebted to the defendant, or whether such garnishee has assets of such defendant in its hands, should be ascertained by comparing their respective claims or accounts, and after service of summons, garnishee may not increase indebtedness to itself for purpose of this comparison. A.C. White Transf. &amp; Storage Co. v. Grady Mem. Hosp., 151 Ga. App. 751, 261 S.E.2d 476 (1979) (decided under former Ga.

Cobb Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Springfield, 145 Ga. App. 753, 245 S.E.2d 42 (1978) (decided under former Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of execution for amount of garnished property.</b> - When judgment is rendered against the garnishee for property in the garnishee's control at the time of service of the summons of garnishment, and the execution is issued for an amount equal to the value of that same property, no distinction will be drawn between the judgment and the execution; indeed, the garnishee must turn over an amount equal to the value of the garnishable property. Toporek v. Water Processing Co., 169 Ga. App. 141, 312 S.E.2d 132 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-20).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Finding required as to amount withheld.</b> - Trial court erred when the court did not determine whether more had been withheld from the party's earnings than was subject to garnishment under subsection (d) of former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-20 as the issue was distinctly raised in the evidence and in the party's contentions that these garnishments were keeping the party in slavery and destroying the party's ability to pay current obligations.

<p class="p4"><b>Limitation on creation of debts to defeat garnishment.</b> - Statutory limitation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-20(b) as to payments to the defendant is based upon the theory that a garnishee may not create a debt on the part of a defendant after the service of the summons of garnishment and then use that debt in order to defeat the lien created by the service of that summons. Ameron Protective Coatings Div. v. Georgia Steel, Inc., 25 Bankr. 781 (Bankr.

Money or other property may be exempt from garnishment for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the limitations on garnishment as provided in Code Sections 18-4-5 and 18-4-53, exemptions as provided in Code Section 18-4-6, the plaintiff not having a judgment against the defendant, the amount claimed due by the plaintiff being erroneous, such money or other property being subject to a claim held by a third party that is superior to the judgment described in the affidavit of garnishment, or other legal or statutory defenses. Even when earnings are held at a financial institution, such money may be exempt from garnishment due to the limitations on garnishment as provided in Code Sections 18-4-5 and 18-4-53, exemptions as provided in Code Section 18-4-6, or other reasons. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Challenge to validity of judgment not permitted.</b> - In a postjudgment garnishment proceeding, the judgment debtor's traverse asserting the judgment was void or voidable was clearly an impermissible challenge to the validity of the judgment. The trial court was not authorized to consider the debtor's verified complaint for damages which addressed issues in bar of judgment in support of the debtor's traverse, and the trial court improperly dismissed the proceeding by granting summary judgment on the debtor's verified complaint without holding an evidentiary hearing on the debtor's traverse.

Copeland v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 317 Ga. App. 669, 732 S.E.2d 536 (2012), cert. denied, No. S13C0189, 2013 Ga.

Smith v. Smith, 161 Ga. App. 20, 289 S.E.2d 5 (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-65).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Motion to vacate garnishment analogous to traverse.</b> - Motion to vacate a garnishment is analogous to a traverse of the garnishment, and, in turn, the same legal principle regarding the finality of judgment may be applied in both situations. Georgia Farm Bldgs., Inc. v. Willard, 169 Ga. App. 394, 313 S.E.2d 112 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discharge of garnishee upon plaintiff's failure to traverse answer.</b> - By enacting a specific time limitation within which the plaintiff must traverse the garnishee's answer, the legislature expressed a clear intent to provide for automatic discharge of the garnishee from all obligations under the summons if the plaintiff did not notify the court and garnishee otherwise within the brief prescribed time period. Nockonwood Indus., Inc. v. Tuloka Affiliates, Inc., 164 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rank of judgment on which garnishment depends determines priority.</b> - Because of ancillary nature of garnishment, the relevant factor in determining priorities of several garnishments is rank of judgment on which garnishment is dependent and not rank of garnishment lien. 1981 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's fees for defense of garnishment.</b> - Reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the defendant in a garnishment proceeding in defense to the garnishment constitute damages sustained by the defendant in consequence of suing out a garnishment and are recoverable as such in suit on bond. Cohen v. Nichols, 54 Ga. App. 394, 188 S.E. 48 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof required of defendant to sustain traverse that defendant is not indebted in amount alleged.</b> - See Thacker Constr. Co. v. Williams, 154 Ga. App. 670, 269 S.E.2d 519 (1980) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-511).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial of issue created by traverse should be postponed until after judgment against defendant.</b> Whaley v. Kear, 139 Ga. 16, 76 S.E. 390 (1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5283).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial of defendant's traverse or evidentiary hearing required.</b> - In a postjudgment garnishment proceeding, the judgment debtor's traverse asserting that the judgment was void or voidable was clearly an impermissible challenge to the validity of the judgment. The trial court was not authorized to consider the debtor's verified complaint for damages which addressed issues in bar of judgment in support of the debtor's traverse, and the trial court improperly dismissed the proceeding by granting summary judgment on the debtor's verified complaint without holding an evidentiary hearing on the debtor's traverse. Southern Land &amp; Cattle Co. v. Brock, 213 Ga. App. 3, 443 S.E.2d 647 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-88).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Verdict for plaintiff for amount named in traverse</b> is construed as a finding in favor of traverse. Whaley v. Kear, 139 Ga. 16, 76 S.E. 390 (1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 5283).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General litigation expenses statute, O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 13-6-11, does not apply in garnishment proceedings.</b> Worsham Bros. Co. v. FDIC, 167 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Attorney fees must be included in the amount claimed</b> or those fees will be stricken. Worsham Bros. Co. v. FDIC, 167 Ga. App. 163, 305 S.E.2d 816 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-92).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court must specifically find that the garnishee had money owing</b> to or belonging to the judgment debtor; the garnishee's refusal to produce records to rebut allegations that the debtor was the garnishee's employee did not satisfy the creditor's burden of showing that the garnishee had money of the debtor. W.R. Leasing, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur., 211 Ga. App. 818, 440 S.E.2d 714 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-92).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Excessive award.</b> - Trial court's order in garnishment proceeding was defective since the order failed to indicate what monies were due the judgment debtor from the garnishees and, therefore, failed to find what money was subject to garnishment, and when, due to an award of interest, the total amount of judgment exceeded amount claimed due by the plaintiff. Stone v. George F. Richardson, Inc., 163 Ga. App. 86, 293 S.E.2d 746 (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-92).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Disposition of funds paid into court when plaintiff loses in determination on merits of traverse</b> - See Paris v. State, 25 Ga. App. 707, 104 S.E. 510 (1920) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-514).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Property interest.</b> - Because the debtor had a property interest in the debtor's claim against the debtor's employer, it followed that the debtor had a property interest in garnished funds.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discharge of garnishee upon plaintiff's failure to traverse answer.</b> - By enacting a specific time limitation within which the plaintiff must traverse the garnishee's answer, the legislature expressed a clear intent to provide for automatic discharge of the garnishee from all obligations under the summons if the plaintiff did not notify the court and the garnishee otherwise within the brief prescribed time period. Nockonwood Indus., Inc. v. Tuloka Affiliates, Inc., 164 Ga. App. 424, 296 S.E.2d 405 (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-85).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party asserting superior claim must traverse garnishee's answer.</b> - Defendant who has elected to become a party to the garnishment proceedings and who has a claim superior to that of the plaintiff to money or property in the hands of the garnishee is authorized to, and indeed must, assert such a claim and then traverse the answer of the garnishee. Terrell v. Fuller, 160 Ga. App. 56, 286 S.E.2d 50 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-85).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Failure of plaintiff to include sufficient addresses on summons of garnishment.</b> - In garnishment proceeding, the plaintiff was required to traverse garnishee's answer within 15 days after filing of answer even though it had not been served with a copy of the answer where it had failed to include its or its attorney's address on the summons of garnishment. Nockonwood Indus., Inc. v. Tuloka Affiliates, Inc., 164 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure to serve answers.</b> - When the name and address of the plaintiff's attorney appeared on the summons of garnishment but no certificates of service were attached to the answers and neither the plaintiff nor the attorney acknowledged receipt, the requirement that the plaintiff traverse the answers within 15 days of service was never triggered. Lowery v. Dallis, 237 Ga. App. 309, 513 S.E.2d 740 (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-85).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Garnishee's answer is accepted as true unless traversed by claimant or defendant.</b> - When garnishee answers summons of garnishment, statements in garnishee's answer are accepted as true, and garnishee is discharged from all further liability unless either the claimant or the defendant files a traverse contesting the answer. West v. West, 402 F. Supp. 1189 (N.D. Ga. 1975) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-303). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Unqualified, though general denial of truth of answer, suffices.</b> - Traverse may be amplified at option of the plaintiff, but nothing more is necessary to bring in question the liability of the garnishee to the garnishing creditor than an unqualified, though general, denial of the truth of the garnishee's answer. Rainey v. Eatonton Coop. Creamery, 69 Ga. App. 547, 26 S.E.2d 297 (1943) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-303).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-91 was a remedial statute. It provided a second chance for a garnishee who, having been personally served with a summons of garnishment, ignored its call for an answer. Five Star Steel Contractors, Inc. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishee's failure to accept certified mail notification</b> that a default judgment had been entered against the garnishee satisfied the requirement of "actual notice" in former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-91 so as to commence the running of the 60-day period during which, upon payment of accrued costs, a garnishee may move to modify the default judgment.

<p class="p4"><b>Former O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 18-4-91 was applicable only after</b> a garnishee failed or refused to file a timely answer to the summons of garnishment and a default judgment is subsequently entered against the garnishee.

<p class="p4"><b>Filing motion to reduce judgment does not amount to recognition of judgment's validity.</b> - By filing motion to reduce amount of judgment under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-509, the defendant does not recognize the validity of the judgment so as to be estopped from thereafter seeking to set the judgment aside. Gibbs v. Spencer Indus., Inc., 244 Ga. 450, 260 S.E.2d 342 (1979) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 46-509).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Amendment of motion.</b> - Prior to judgment thereon, a motion filed under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-91 may be retroactively amended to substitute the name and signature of a licensed Georgia attorney pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-15.

<p class="p4">O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-24 requires both the timely filing of a motion to modify and the payment of accrued court costs as statutory prerequisites to modification of the default judgment, but the statute does not require the payment of costs before the filing of the motion. To the extent that J.E.E.H. Enterprises, Inc. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 172 Ga. App. 58 (1984), Marler Oil Co. v. Citizens &amp; Southern Bank, 153 Ga. App. 186 (1980), Boston Sea Party v.

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-21 was not unconstitutionally vague, nor did the statute violate equal protection of the laws for two reasons: (1) this was a limited waiver of state sovereign immunity from suit; and (2) the section was intended to encourage selfless response to emergencies on the part of governmental employees.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Garnishment of funds other than those designated by section.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-4-21 provided for limited waiver of sovereign immunity by permitting salaries of officials and employees of the state and the state's subdivisions to be made subject to garnishment. That section, however, was silent as to other funds in hands of the subdivision of the state. Therefore, such funds were still not subject to garnishment in Georgia. Grant v. Barge, 160 Ga.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p12">You received this notice because money, including wages, and other property belonging to you have been garnished to pay a court judgment against you. HOWEVER, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR MONEY, INCLUDING WAGES, OR OTHER PROPERTY.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p12"><b>READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> <br>
</p>
<p class="p12">State and federal law protects some money, including wages, from garnishment even if it is in a bank. Some common exemptions are benefits from social security, supplemental security income, unemployment, workers' compensation, the Veterans' Administration, state pension, retirement funds, and disability income. This list of exemptions does not include all possible exemptions. A more detailed list of exemptions is available at the Clerk of Court's office located at __________________ (Name of Court), __________________ (Address), __________________ (City), Georgia __________ (ZIP Code), and on the website for the Attorney General (www.law.ga.gov).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p12">Garnishment of your earnings from your employment is limited to the lesser of 25 percent of your disposable earnings for a week or the amount by which your disposable earnings for a week exceed $217.50. More than 25 percent of your disposable earnings may be taken from your earnings for the payment of child support or alimony or if a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows a higher amount.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p12"><b>TO PROTECT YOUR MONEY, INCLUDING WAGES, AND OTHER PROPERTY FROM BEING GARNISHED, YOU MUST:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> <br>

</p>
<p class="p12">FILE YOUR COMPLETED CLAIM FORM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. You may lose your right to claim an exemption if you do not file your claim form within 20 days after the Garnishee's Answer is filed or if you do not mail or deliver a copy of your completed claim form to the Plaintiff and the Garnishee at the addresses listed on this notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p12">The Court will schedule a hearing within ten days from when it receives your claim form. The Court will mail you the time and date of the hearing at the address that you provide on your claim form. You may go to the hearing with or without an attorney. You will need to give the Court documents or other proof that your money is exempt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p12">The Clerk of Court cannot give you legal advice. IF YOU NEED LEGAL ASSISTANCE, YOU SHOULD SEE AN ATTORNEY. If you cannot afford a private attorney, legal services may be available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
