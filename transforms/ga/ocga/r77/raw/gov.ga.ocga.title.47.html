<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As used in this Code section, the term "local retirement system" means any retirement, pension, or emeritus system covering an employee or employees of a county, municipality, local board of education, or other political subdivision, or any groups or classifications of such employees which is funded at least in part by such political subdivisions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The board of trustees or other governing authority of each local retirement system is authorized and directed to designate and retain the services of a qualified actuary to provide technical advice and assistance to the board of trustees or governing authority in the management of the retirement system and in the preparation of surveys or reports required under this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any political subdivision maintaining a local retirement system for an employee or employees or for classifications of employees is authorized to expend any public funds available to it to pay any portion of the administrative costs of the retirement system, if the funds available to the retirement system are not adequate to pay the administrative costs, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of any laws relative to such local retirement system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once every two years, the board of trustees or other governing authority of each local retirement system shall have the system's actuary make an actuarial investigation. Such actuarial investigation shall include the results of any actuarial investigation into the then current assumptions as to rates of interest, mortality, disability, withdrawal, and retirement. The actuarial investigation shall also include consideration of the experience of the retirement system under its assumptions and a comparison of results with the previous actuarial investigations and may also include such other studies as may be necessary or desirable for the completeness and accuracy of the actuarial investigation. The actuarial investigation shall also include a valuation of the contingent assets and liabilities of the retirement system and a determination of the payments necessary to amortize over a stated period any unfunded accrued liability disclosed. As an exhibit to the actuarial investigation, the local retirement system board of trustees or other governing authority thereof shall attach a copy of all the provisions of the plan for the local retirement system, including the requirements and conditions for qualifying to participate, the nature of benefits under the plan, and the manner in which the local retirement system is funded. Beginning on October 1, 1996, and every two years thereafter on such date, the board of trustees or other governing authority of each such local retirement system shall have on file with the state auditor an actuarial investigation meeting the requirements of this subsection. This subsection shall not apply to a retirement or pension program which is established pursuant to an insurance contract between an insurer and a county, municipality, local board of education, or other political subdivision or between an insurer and any commission, board, or other agency of any such political subdivision. As used in the preceding sentence, the word "insurance" and the word "insurer" shall have the meanings set forth, respectively, in Code Section 33-1-2. Municipalities providing a retirement program for their employees pursuant to a contract with the Board of Trustees of the Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System shall not be required to submit actuarial investigations under this subsection or financial reports under this Code section. In lieu of such actuarial investigations and reports, the Board of Trustees of the Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System shall prepare a comprehensive report once every two years based on the information required under Code Sections 47-5-26 and 47-5-30. Such comprehensive reports shall be filed with the state auditor at the same time as actuarial investigations are filed as provided in this subsection.

<p class="p4"><b>Retirement rights vested by one statute cannot be taken away</b> by a subsequent statute. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-122. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Once a right has been extended to the membership of a public retirement system by statute, it becomes part of the employment contract of the affected employees and cannot thereafter be constitutionally deleted or impaired. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U77-20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Forfeiture of benefits by employees convicted of crime.</b> - General Assembly has the authority to enact a statute which proposes the forfeiture of earned retirement benefits of future public employees due to the conviction of a crime; however, an amendment to the Georgia Constitution proposing such a forfeiture by employees who are currently by law vested with rights under the public retirement system would, in all probability, be unconstitutional under the federal Impairment Clause contained in U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 10. 1985 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U85-3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election of regular retiree does not suspend benefits.</b> - Retirement benefits are not suspended if regular retiree is elected to full-time, paid county office. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-56.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Chapter is intended to apply prospectively.</b> 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-82.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Credit for military service before 1953.</b> - In order to obtain credit for military service rendered prior to July 1, 1953, a state employee must have been a member of the retirement system on January 1, 1954. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 366.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Credit for service as city court judge.</b> - Individual is entitled to credit in retirement system for service as a city court judge, but not for service as a municipal court judge or an ex-officio city court judge. 1954-56 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 598.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Contingency clerks" not in retirement system.</b> - Membership in the retirement system was envisioned for full-time employees of the State of Georgia who occupy positions potentially and probably requiring continued, nonintermittent employment of more than 35 (now 30) hours per week during at least nine months of a year; therefore, personnel within the Department of Labor who occupy the position of "contingency clerk" should not be considered as members of the system and should not be required to contribute to the retirement system, nor should employer contributions be made on their behalves. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-59.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Law does not preclude dual employment</b> if one works full time with one employer and attempts simultaneously to serve full time in another capacity for another master. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 368.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Member not prohibited from receiving benefits from two retirement systems.</b> - Member of the Employees' Retirement System who, as a statutory condition of continued employment, also becomes a bona fide member of the Public School Employees Retirement System, is not prohibited by law from receiving retirement benefits from both systems for valid, separable periods of creditable service, assuming that all other requisite conditions in these provisions are met. 1979 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Employees of multi-state agency not in state system.</b> - Employees of the Southern Interstate Nuclear Board (now Southern States Energy Board), being employees of a multi-state agency and not of the State of Georgia, are not entitled to membership in the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 364, but see 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-22.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employees in state positions funded under federal employment provisions cannot participate in retirement systems.</b> - Law did not contain sufficient authority to implement the conditions and requirements of the regulations promulgated by the United States Secretary of Labor which prescribed the conditions under which employees of the state and local governments and private nonprofit agencies in Georgia whose positions were funded under the former federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 (CETA), 29 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 801 et seq., participated in retirement systems. 1977 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Need not resign emeritus eligibility before seeking Supreme Court seat.</b> - To whatever extent the forfeiture and resignation provisions enacted in 1962 may be applicable to judges of the superior courts generally, it cannot be applied constitutionally to a judge to restrict or impair the retirement rights and benefits the judge received under the statute in effect when the judge took office; the judge is not required to resign the judge's emeritus eligibility prior to seeking a seat on the Supreme Court of Georgia. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U74-51 (rendered under Ga. L. 1962, p. 602).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The petition may be filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county of residence of the employee. The petition shall state the nature of the employee's interest and the grounds as specified in subsection (f) of this Code section upon which the employee contends that the employee's discharge from employment should be reversed or modified. The petition may be amended by leave of the court. The filing of the petition does not itself stay the enforcement of the employer's decision to discharge the employee, but the reviewing court may order a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The employer may modify the employer's findings and decision to discharge the employee by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the employer may consider the annual rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period, and it may omit the deduction from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if the employee was not a member on the first or last day of the payroll period. In order to facilitate the making of deductions, the employer may modify the deductions required of any member but not by more than one-tenth of 1 percent of the annual compensation from which such deductions are to be made. Each employer shall immediately pay amounts deducted to the board of trustees, in such manner as the board of trustees shall prescribe, which amounts shall be credited by the board of trustees to the member's account in the annuity savings fund.

<p class="p11">(3) In addition to the contributions deducted from the compensation of members under paragraph (1) of this subsection and subject to the approval of the board of trustees and such conditions as it may prescribe, any member may redeposit in the annuity savings fund, by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution, all or any part of amounts that were previously withdrawn from it under this chapter; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p11">(a) (1) (A)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upon written application to the board of trustees, any member in service who has reached 60 years of age or who has 30 years of creditable service may retire on a service retirement allowance, provided that he or she has at least five years of creditable service; provided, further, that if he or she became a member after July 1, 1968, he or she has at least ten years of creditable service. The effective date of retirement shall be the first of the month in which the application is received by the board of trustees, provided that no retirement application will, in any case, be effective earlier than the first of the month following the final month of the applicant's employment. Applications for retirement shall not be accepted more than 90 days in advance of the effective date of retirement. Separation from service pending approval of the retirement application shall not affect eligibility for a retirement allowance. The provisions of this subsection regarding the effective date of retirement shall apply to all persons making application for retirement on or after March 15, 1979, and to all persons who have made application prior to March 15, 1979, but to whom payments from the retirement system have not commenced as of that date. Each employer shall certify to the board of trustees the date on which the employee's employment is or will be severed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) If the employee has not reached normal retirement age on the effective date of retirement, the employer shall certify that no agreement exists to allow the employee to return to service, including service as or for an independent contractor. Any return to employment or rendering of any paid service by such employee, including service as or for an independent contractor, for any employer within two consecutive calendar months of the effective date of retirement shall render the severance invalid, nullifying the application for retirement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Normal retirement age, for purposes of the retirement system, shall be the date the employee has reached 60 years of age, provided that he or she has at least ten years of creditable service or the age of an employee on the date he or she attains 30 years of creditable service; provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph are subject to change by future legislation in order to comply with federal regulations. For those members who are in service with the Uniform Division of the Department of Public Safety as an officer, noncommissioned officer, or trooper, officers and agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, game wardens of the Department of Natural Resources, or in the Department of Revenue as an alcohol and tobacco officer or agent, normal retirement age shall be the date the employee has reached 55 years of age, provided that he or she has at least ten years of creditable service. For purposes of Section 402(l) of the federal Internal Revenue Code regarding distributions from governmental plans for health and long-term care insurance for public safety officers, normal retirement age shall be the earliest date when the employee has satisfied the requirements for a retirement allowance under the retirement system. Except as provided under Article 2 of Chapter 1 of this title, a member's right to his or her retirement allowance is nonforfeitable upon attainment of normal retirement age. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As used in this subsection, in addition to the definition provided in Code Section 47-2-1, the term "employer" shall also include the retired member's last employer which reported to the retirement system prior to the member's effective date of retirement. Such term shall also include the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Except as provided in this subsection, if a member accepts paid employment with or renders services for pay to any employer, including, without limitation, service directly or indirectly as or for an independent contractor, after his or her retirement, payment of his or her retirement allowance shall be suspended and no contributions to the retirement system shall be made on account of such service either by that member or his or her employer, provided that, upon termination of such service, all rights shall vest in that member as if he or she had continued his or her option to retire. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) The retirement allowance of a retired member who accepts employment with or renders services to any employer after his or her retirement shall not be suspended if the employee has attained normal retirement age or has not been employed by or rendered service for any employer for at least two consecutive calendar months and performs no more than 1,040 hours of paid employment or paid service, including, without limitation, service as or for an independent contractor, for the employer in any calendar year; provided, however, that return to service as or for an independent contractor shall not result in the suspension of an employee's retirement allowance if the employing agency certifies to the board of trustees that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) The contracting entity has multiple employees; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The contracting entity has multiple contracts, and the contracts are not limited to employers, as such term is defined in Code Section 47-2-1; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) The contractual relationship with the employer was not created to allow a retired employee to continue employment after retirement in a position similar to the one he or she held before retirement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) Any employer that employs a retired plan member shall within 30 days of the employee's accepting employment notify the board of trustees in writing stating the name of the plan member and the number of hours the employee is expected to work annually and shall provide such other information as the board may request. If the retired plan member performs more than 1,040 hours in any calendar year, the employer shall so notify the board of trustees as soon as such information is available. Any employer that fails to notify the board of trustees as required by this subsection shall reimburse the retirement system for any benefits wrongfully paid. It shall be the duty of the retired plan member seeking employment by the employer to notify the employer of his or her retirement status prior to accepting such position. If a retired plan member fails to so notify the employer and the employer becomes liable to the retirement system, the plan member shall hold the employer harmless for all such liability. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The board of trustees is authorized to provide by rule or regulation for the payment of benefits to members or beneficiaries of the retirement system at a time and under circumstances not provided for in this chapter to the extent that such payment is required to maintain the retirement system as a "qualified retirement plan" for the purposes of federal income tax laws.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(4) If the commissioner of administrative services fails to obtain a position of continued employment in conformity with the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection for an official or employee proposed for discretionary termination, then, on the effective date of the discretionary termination, the official or employee may be considered involuntarily separated from employment without prejudice for the purposes of this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">General Assembly intended for the state to retain employees eligible for involuntary separation benefits, but required the state to offer a reasonably comparable job at the same pay to any employee subject to a discretionary termination.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employee must be personally examined when involuntarily retired for disability.</b> - When an employee is to be involuntarily retired under subsection (b) of this statute, the medical board is required to have the employee personally examined in order to provide a basis for the board's report. Cantrell v. State, 129 Ga. App. 465, 200 S.E.2d 163 (1973), aff'd, 231 Ga. 704, 203 S.E.2d 493 (1974), overruled in part on other grounds, Cantrell v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Examination may be by any physician on medical board.</b> - Subsection (b) of this statute does not require that any one or all of the three physicians constituting the medical board personally make the required examination. Cantrell v. State, 129 Ga. App. 465, 200 S.E.2d 163 (1973), aff'd, 231 Ga. 704, 203 S.E.2d 493 (1974), overruled in part on other grounds, Cantrell v.

<p class="p4">When the only issue is reinstatement and when the procedure followed to achieve this remedy is an appeal to the State Personnel Board and not the Employees' Retirement System, the technicalities of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-123 do not come into play. Tanner v. Freeman, 257 Ga. 146, 356 S.E.2d 201 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of failure to follow termination procedures.</b> - An attempt by the state to terminate the employment of an employee who is entitled to coverage under the involuntary separation retirement benefits provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-123 without following the specified procedures is ineffective. State v. Hudgins, 220 Ga. App. 555, 469 S.E.2d 363 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limited eligibility for deputy conservation rangers.</b> - General Assembly specifically limited eligibility of deputy conservation ranger for benefits to a claim based upon injury incurred in the line of law enforcement duty. The fact that the legislature did not see fit to use the same language with respect to the other officers and agents covered by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-123<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is clearly indicative of the intention that the language is to have a different meaning as applied to the other covered employees than it does as applied to a deputy conservation ranger.

<p class="p4"><b>When employee entitled to separation benefits.</b> - When an employee has been separated from employment without prejudice, the relevant issue for determining whether the employee is entitled to separation benefits is whether the termination was voluntary or involuntary.

<p class="p4"><b>Discretionary termination.</b> - When an employee becomes subjected to a discretionary termination, subsection (h) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-123 requires the commissioner of personnel administration to seek continued employment for the employee at the "same or greater" annual compensation and with duties that are "reasonably compatible with the previous work experience and educational qualifications" of the employee.

<p class="p4"><b>Discharge not involuntary when caused intentionally by employee.</b> - State employee is not involuntarily discharged from employment when the employee knowingly and intentionally brings about the discharge, or engages in conduct, such as insubordination, excessive absences, or other misconduct which the employee knew or should have known would lead to the employee's dismissal from employment. Haggins v. Employees' Retirement Sys., 255 Ga. 352, 338 S.E.2d 1 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Employee's objectionable conduct, consisting of the illegal acceptance of gratuities and the purposeful failure to comply with state laws and regulations, constituted the kind of activity that any employee would know or should have known would result in the employee's dismissal, and thus did not constitute involuntary separation within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-123.

<p class="p4"><b>Requirements of Public Service Commission.</b> - Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-123<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>does not require the Public Service Commission (PSC) to reappoint plaintiff as a confidential secretary, the PSC must offer plaintiff a job with reasonably compatible duties and at the same pay as the plaintiff's former secretarial job.

<p class="p4"><b>Interpretation of "fail to reappoint."</b> - Phrase "fail to reappoint" in subsection (g) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-123 means the failure to reappoint an employee to another state position at the same pay and with reasonably compatible duties.

<p class="p4"><b>Section permissive, not mandatory.</b> - It is clear that, under the language of this statute, the General Assembly used permissive words and not mandatory provisions. A close analysis of the provisions reveals that the governing authority of the county in which the court is located can deduct or collect employee contributions only from members, and there is no authorization contained therein that contributions shall apply in a mandatory manner to all officers and employees of the courts. This restrictive language, considered with the permissive words "authorized to become members," clearly shows this statute to be permissive and not mandatory. 1957 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff lacked property interest in continued employment.</b> - Plaintiff contended that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-2-292 mandated that employees of the Madison County Tax Commissioner's Office (TCO) be subject to a merit system under which the employees were entitled to a hearing prior to termination. However, the statute contained no such requirement, and plaintiff did not point to any evidence that the TCO of Madison County promulgated a merit system that required a hearing prior to termination for cause; accordingly, plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing prior to termination and did not have a protected property interest in continued employment with the TCO. Epps v. Watson,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(M.D. Ga. Oct. 30, 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No vested interest in continued employment shown.</b> - In a racial discrimination suit, the trial court properly denied mandamus relief to the former employee because the former employee failed to show that the employer had a clear legal duty to maintain the former employee as an employee and there was no evidence showing that the former employee was ever a merit system employee with a vested interest in continued employment with the tax commissioner.

All employees of the inspection service shall be subject to a merit system of personnel administration established by the agencies which are parties to a cooperative agreement between the Consumer and Marketing Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Georgia Department of Agriculture. All employees shall perform services on the basis of merit, fitness, and efficiency. The establishment of this merit system prior to July 1, 1975, shall be a prerequisite to coverage of the inspection service under the retirement system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In order to become or be required to be a member of the retirement system, an employee of the inspection service must be employed in this state in a position normally requiring actual performance of duty during not less than nine months of the year. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In the computation of such contributions and interest, the compensation of such member shall be deemed to have been the same as the compensation such member received on the date he first became a member. For any member claiming creditable service under this subsection on and after July 1, 1983, the board of trustees shall calculate the period of time the contributions and interest provided for above will fund as creditable service under the retirement system without creating any additional accrued liability of the retirement system; and the amount of creditable service so determined shall be the creditable service to which the member is entitled. The inspection service shall be authorized to supplement contributions and interest provided for above in an amount, as determined by the board of trustees, which, together with such contributions and interest, will fully fund as creditable service the total amount of previous service claimed without creating any additional accrued liability of the retirement system, and in the event such supplement is paid by the inspection service to the board of trustees, the member shall be entitled to receive all such previous service as creditable service up to the maximum of five years. Credit for previous service shall be available to a member only after he has worked for the inspection service for one full year following July 1, 1975, and must be exercised, if at all, within one year after the time any such member becomes eligible to elect such option or by not later than January 1, 1984, whichever date is later. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Such service shall be in addition to the creditable service authorized by subsection (f) of this Code section. In order to receive such creditable service, the member must pay to the board of trustees the employee contributions of 5 percent of his or her salary on July 1, 1975, for each month of creditable service, together with interest at the rate of 4 percent compounded annually from July 1, 1975, to the date of payment.

<p class="p11">(a) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2) through (5) of this subsection, any member in service who has at least 15 years of creditable service who becomes disabled in service before becoming eligible to receive a service retirement allowance may be retired on a disability allowance by the board of trustees, upon written application to the board of trustees by the member or his or her employer and upon certification by the medical board that he or she is medically or physically incapable of further performance of his or her duties in the position he or she held at the time his or her disability originated, that incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that he or she should be retired; provided, however, that the medical board shall not consider any evidence of such disability which is not submitted within 12 months after the date the member submits his or her first application for a disability retirement. The board of trustees may retire such member not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days after execution and filing of the written application. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) A member making application for a disability retirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall at the same time submit a copy of such application together with any supporting documentation accompanying such application to his or her employing agency. The member shall thereafter provide the employing agency with any additional information or documentation which he or she submits to the board of trustees in conjunction with such application. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) After receipt of the notice provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the head of the member's agency or his or her designee shall conduct an interview with the member applying for disability retirement; provided, however, that any designee of the head of an agency shall be an official at such agency who is above the level of the applicant's immediate supervisor and who has the authority to make job assignment decisions. The interview shall be held within ten business days after receipt of such notice. Based on the interview and information received by the agency pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the agency head or his or her designee shall determine if an alternative position is available for the member which meets the following requirements: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) The physical requirements for such position are compatible with the member's physical limitations; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The annual compensation and possibility for future advancement for such position shall be the same as or greater than that of the current position of the member; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) The duties for such position shall be reasonably compatible with the experience and educational qualifications of the member; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(D) The position shall be one which includes the holder thereof as a member of the retirement system provided for by this chapter; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(E) The position must be available for acceptance by the member and an offer of the position to the official or member must be made, in writing, by not later than 45 days after the member submitted his or her application for a disability retirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11">An agency making an offer of alternative employment as provided in this paragraph shall so notify the board of trustees within 45 days after the member submitted his or her application for a disability retirement. After receipt of such notice, the board of trustees shall not approve a disability retirement until the procedures of paragraph (4) of this subsection are resolved. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) Any member applying for a disability retirement who is offered a position of employment in conformity with the requirements of paragraph (3) of this subsection shall accept the offer or dispute his or her ability to perform the tasks required by the position offered by submitting a written appeal to the agency and to the board of trustees within 30 days after receiving the offer. In the event of an appeal, the agency shall promptly submit to the medical board a detailed description of the requirements of the position offered and the medical board shall determine, based upon all information available to it, whether the member is reasonably capable of performing such tasks. The decision of the medical board shall be final. If the medical board determines that the member is unable to perform the tasks required either by the position held at the time of the application for a disability retirement or the position offered, the member shall be placed on disability retirement immediately. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(5) A member who refuses to accept a position offered or file an appeal in a timely manner or who refuses to accept a position which the medical board has determined on appeal that he or she is capable of performing shall not be eligible to receive a disability retirement under this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The disability beneficiary may request such an examination. Should any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained retirement age refuse to submit to such medical examination, the pension of such disability beneficiary may be discontinued by the board of trustees until the withdrawal of such refusal; and should the refusal continue for one year, all rights of the disability beneficiary in and to a pension may be revoked by the board of trustees. Should the medical board report and certify to the board of trustees that a disability beneficiary is engaged in or is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between the disability beneficiary's retirement allowance and the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement, the board of trustees may reduce the disability beneficiary's pension to an amount which, together with the disability beneficiary's annuity and the amount earnable by the disability beneficiary, equals the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement. Should the disability beneficiary's earning capacity be later changed, the amount of the pension may be further modified, provided that the modified pension shall not exceed an amount which, together with the disability beneficiary's annuity and the amount earnable by the disability beneficiary, equals the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) The board of trustees may require a disability beneficiary who has not yet attained retirement age as specified in subsection (a) of Code Section 47-2-110 to provide information relevant to any provision of this chapter relating to his or her entitlement to receive a disability retirement. Should any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained retirement age refuse to submit any such information so requested, the board of trustees may suspend the retirement allowance of such disability beneficiary until such information is provided. Should the board of trustees receive information from any source that a disability beneficiary is engaged in an occupation paying more than the difference between the disability beneficiary's retirement allowance and the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement, the board of trustees may reduce the disability beneficiary's pension to an amount which, together with the disability beneficiary's annuity and the amount earnable by the disability beneficiary, equals the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement. Should the disability beneficiary's earnings later be changed, the amount of the pension may be further modified, provided that the modified pension shall not exceed an amount which, together with the disability beneficiary's annuity and the amount earnable by the disability beneficiary, equals the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Chapter applicable to prior retirees.</b> - Teacher who has reached the age of 60, has taught in the state school system for 35 years, and has retired before Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 3, T. 47) became effective was entitled to the benefits of Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 3, T. 47). 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 216. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Upon reading Ga. L. 1974, p. 1139, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-3-124) within the context of Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 3, T. 47), and upon considering precipitant events leading to the passage of Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 3, T. 47), it becomes evident that Ga. L. 1974, p. 1139, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 was designed to include theretofore excluded local fund retirees. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-9.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Employees of Georgia Teachers' Education Association may not participate.</b> - Georgia Teachers' Education Association cannot be construed to be an agency of the state so as to make the association an "employer," as defined by Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 3, T. 47), nor can an employee of the association be construed as a "teacher" within the definition given by Ga. L. 1943, pp. 640 and 641. 1948-49 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 131.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Teachers employed by commission charter schools.</b> - Unless and until the General Assembly adopts clarifying legislation, it is within the sound discretion of the Teachers Retirement System Board of Trustees to determine whether teachers who are employed not less than half-time by commission charter schools must be members of the Teachers Retirement System.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2010 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retirement funds made available from retirement system.</b> - Retirement system is required to make available funds so that a minimum monthly amount is paid to retired members for each year of service up to 40 years; if sufficient funds are not readily available within the retirement system itself, they may be requested from state funds. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 372.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Local boards may supplement allowances.</b> - Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 et seq. (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 3, T. 47) acknowledges power of local boards to supplement retirement and pension allowances of teachers with other plans, and also acknowledges that tax sheltered annuities might be usable for such a purpose. 1981 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Local school system may establish tax sheltered annuity program.</b> Like a private employer with the power to contract, a local school system may condition employment upon certain requirements so long as the requirements do not violate the Constitution or laws of this state. The teacher's contract may not be unilaterally modified in mid-term to include such a condition; therefore, unless a teacher otherwise agrees to participate in a tax sheltered annuity, the requirement of participation must be included in the employment contract prior to execution and must be agreed upon by both parties before such condition is enforceable. 1981 Op.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retirement benefits to be paid are deferred compensation.</b> - Retirement benefits which would be paid to teacher by Teachers Retirement System are deferred compensation for services previously rendered, while the compensation paid to a teacher by a local board of education for the teacher's current employment is compensation for services being presently rendered; the payments are for separate and different periods of teaching service covered under different retirement systems. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-22.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retirement benefits allocated while currently employed not covered.</b> - There is no stated provision in Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 et seq. (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 3, T. 47) which would prohibit teacher from receiving retirement benefits under Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 et seq. while currently employed in some other teaching position not under Ga. L. 1943, p. 640 et seq. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-22.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Local school board may contract indirectly to pay superintendent's contributions</b> to Teachers Retirement System for health insurance and for social security; however, since local Acts may affect a local school board's ability to make such contributions, the local board attorney should be consulted in each instance. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-55.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Make greater increase in salary than required to pay superintendent's contribution.</b> - For a local school board to pay a local school superintendent's contributions to the Teachers Retirement System, for health insurance, and social security, it must increase the superintendent's salary since O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-3-41 provides that such contributions must be deducted from the superintendent's salary. However, the increase of the salary would itself be subject to the required deduction since it would increase the amount of earnable compensation; thus, the amount of increase required to pay the contribution would obviously have to be more than the amount of the contribution itself. Likewise, for a local school board to make such contributions under the Teachers Health Insurance Plan, it must increase the superintendent's salary since the law provides that such contributions must be withheld from the superintendent's salary. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-55.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Likewise, for a local school board to make such contributions under the Teachers Health Insurance Plan, the board must increase the superintendent's salary since the law provides that such contributions must be withheld from the superintendent's salary. 1981 Op.

Furthermore, it would seem manifestly difficult to articulate the scope and definition of the term "public schoolteachers." If the General Assembly intended to limit the application of the 1974 amendment to a sub-class of "teachers," then more of a definition than "public schoolteachers" would have been provided. 1975 Op.

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The annuity savings fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated the contributions deducted from the compensation of members to provide for their annuities. Contributions to and payments from the annuity savings fund shall be made as follows: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(1) After the commencement date, each employer shall cause to be deducted from the salary of each member for each and every payroll period a percentage of the member's earnable compensation as determined by the board of trustees which shall be not less than 5 nor more than 6 percent; but no such deduction shall be made from the compensation of a member after the close of the school, fiscal, or contract year in which the member has attained age 65 and has completed 40 or more years of creditable service. In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the employer may consider the annual rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period. The employer may omit the deduction from compensation for any period which is less than a full payroll period, if a teacher was not a member on the first day of the payroll period. In order to facilitate the making of deductions, the employer may modify the deductions required of any member by an amount not to exceed one-tenth of 1 percent of the annual compensation, on the basis of which such deductions are to be made. Each employer shall immediately pay the amount deducted to the board of trustees, in such manner as the board of trustees shall prescribe, which amount shall be credited by the board of trustees to the individual accounts in the annuity savings fund of the member from whose compensation the deductions were made. Beginning July 1, 1987, the employee contributions required under this paragraph shall be paid as provided in Code Section 47-3-41.1; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, at the close of any school, fiscal, or contract year in which a member has completed 40 or more years of creditable service, such member may elect in writing to cease making contributions to the retirement system. If such election is made, such teacher shall notify his employer and the board of trustees in such manner as the board of trustees shall prescribe. After giving the required notice, the employer shall not thereafter deduct, and the employee shall not thereafter be allowed to make, contributions to the retirement system from the salary or compensation of such member; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) Any other provision of this or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, a member who has attained age 65 and who has completed 40 or more years of creditable service may elect to continue to make contributions to the retirement system during such continuous period of time as the member continues in service. He shall notify his employer and the board of trustees of such election in such manner as the board of trustees shall provide. Any member who has discontinued making contributions to the retirement system because he has attained age 65 and has 40 years of creditable service and who has continued in service may remit contributions to the board of trustees at the rate required by law and under terms and regulations prescribed by the board of trustees on all earnable compensation received by the member since deductions were discontinued. Contributions made under this paragraph shall entitle the member to creditable service for such period, but only for the purpose of determining average compensation over the highest consecutive years, used in the calculations of the retirement benefits of such member; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(4) Employer deductions shall be made, notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided for by law for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions and payment of salary or compensation, less such deductions, shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except as to the benefits under this chapter. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Make greater increase in salary than required to pay superintendent's contribution.</b> - For a local school board to pay a local school superintendent's contributions to the Teachers Retirement System, for health insurance, and social security, the board must increase the superintendent's salary since O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-3-41 provides that such contributions must be deducted from the superintendent's salary.

Such a system based on joint participation will permit municipal corporations and other entities, regardless of size, to provide certain benefits to their employees, will reduce overall administrative costs which might be prohibitive if undertaken individually, will make possible better investment opportunities, and through a provision for continuity of service will provide added security for professional employees who transfer from one municipal corporation or other entity to another in the state. Creation of such a retirement system is considered to be in the public interest in order to attract and retain better qualified personnel in local governmental service and to provide greater personal security to local governmental employees in their old age. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section inapplicable to firefighter injured prior to section's enactment.</b> - Legislature did not intend in this statute to grant pensions to firefighters who had been injured prior to the enactment of this statute. The legislature, having fairly accurate information of the anticipated revenue, did not intend to saddle the retirement system with an unknown number of prospective claim cases that could ripen into disability pensions after the effective date of this statute; to place such a construction upon this statute might have the result of making the entire retirement system actuarially unsound. The legislature intended to make firefighters who are members of the fund eligible for disability payments when injured while performing official duties while members of the fund. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 228 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-7-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Total disability must result from injury sustained while member.</b> - Total and permanent disability covered by this statute must result from bodily injury sustained while a member of the pension fund. 1958-59 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Benefits commence only after six-month waiting period.</b> - Disability retirement benefits should commence being paid to a member of the fund retired for total and permanent disability only after the six-month "waiting" period under this statute has elapsed. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U75-31 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-7-102).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Special group of judges created by statutory scheme.</b> - Statutory scheme creating the superior court judges emeritus program (now Superior Court Judges Retirement Fund) envisions the creation of a special group of judges to perform duties as provided by law. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U75-3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Senior judge may perform marriage ceremony.</b> - When a statutory provision separate from Ga. L. 1945, p. 362 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 8, T. 47) provides that the ministerial act of performing a marriage ceremony may be carried out by any judge, a judge of the superior courts emeritus (now senior judge of the superior courts) may perform that function. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U75-3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judge entering nineteenth year of service is eligible.</b> - To be eligible for the position of judge of the superior courts emeritus (now senior judge of the superior courts) and retirement on two-thirds of the salary paid the judge of the superior court, a judge need only enter into the judge's nineteenth year of service and need not complete that year. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 78.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No limitation on work time required in fourth year.</b> - There is no limitation in subsection (a) of this statute on the minimum period of time which must be worked as a superior court judge in the fourth year to meet the four-year requirement; thus, it would appear that one day of work as a judge in the fourth year would suffice. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-8 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-8-40).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When judge, or widow, entitled to disability benefits.</b> - Superior court judge is entitled to disability benefits although the judge has not attained the required retirement age, provided the judge otherwise meets the requirements of Ga. L. 1945, p. 362 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 8, T. 47); if such a judge makes the election provided by these provisions, fully complies with the statutory terms, and dies after being entitled to disability benefits, the judge's widow thereby would be entitled to the benefits provided, instead of being forced to accept a return of contributions in accordance with Ga. L. 1945, p. 362, <span class="s1">§</span> 15 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-8-69). 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-331.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Past service as assistant district attorney not creditable.</b> - Service as assistant district attorney rendered prior to section's enactment and approval is not creditable toward an appointment to the office of judge of the superior courts emeritus (now senior judge of the superior courts). 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-14 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-8-40).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Armed forces service during World War II creditable.</b> - Judge of the superior courts is entitled to count the days, months, and years the judge has served in the armed forces of the United States during World War II when computing the judge's 19 years of service. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-53.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Cadet midshipman service creditable.</b> - Service rendered as cadet midshipman in United States Merchant Marine Cadet Corps is creditable service under the provisions of this statute. 1974 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Calculate year on 12-month period, not calendar year.</b> - "Fraction of a year" for armed forces' credit means fraction of a 12-month period, not fraction of a calendar year; moreover, there is no statutory basis for granting a full year's credit for a fraction of a year's service in a civilian state office. 1972 Op.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Even though the position of senior judge is not an elected one, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. III allows a senior judge to exercise judicial power in the superior courts when the assistance of a senior judge is necessary. O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 15-1-9.2 and 47-8-61 are simply the statutory enactments pursuant to the constitution. Smith v. Langford, 271 Ga. 221, 518 S.E.2d 884 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There is no merit to the argument that the authorization for the service of senior judges conflicts with Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. I, vesting judicial power in designated courts, because creation of the position of senior judge does not establish a separate judicial forum. Smith v. Langford, 271 Ga. 221, 518 S.E.2d 884 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prohibition on practice of law limited to federal courts.</b> - Those judges who have become senior judges under the 1945 Superior Court Judges Retirement Fund Act (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-8-1 et seq.), or who are eligible to become senior judges under that Act, are not prohibited from practicing law; those judges are only prohibited by the Act from practicing law in the federal courts. State v. McMillan, 253 Ga. 154, 319 S.E.2d 1 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prohibition on practice of law unconstitutional.</b> - Prohibition in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-8-61 on senior judges retired under the 1945 Act from "practicing as attorneys, proctors, or solicitors in any court of the United States" is a violation of the due process rights of such judges and is of no force and effect. State v. McMillan, 253 Ga. 154, 319 S.E.2d 1 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Governor's order to determine "any and all" cases unauthorized.</b> - An order of the Governor that a judge emeritus (now senior judge) hear and determine "any and all other cases which may be pending" and "any and all other cases which may properly come before said court for disposition" is manifestly unauthorized by law, and hence confers no authority upon the judge to hear and determine such cases. Trammell v. Trammell, 220 Ga. 293, 138 S.E.2d 562 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Senior judge unauthorized to certify bill of exceptions.</b> - Because a superior court judge emeritus (now senior judge) had not been granted constitutional or statutory authority to serve as a superior court judge, except when the Governor was authorized to call upon the judge to do so, or the judge was selected to serve as such in a civil case under the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 24-2623, 2624, 2625, and 2626 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 15-6-13 and 15-6-14), it necessarily followed that a superior court judge emeritus (now senior judge) not within these exceptions was wholly without the jurisdiction or power to certify a bill of exceptions (now abolished) in a case tried by a superior court judge.

<p class="p4"><b>Exception to rule that only superior court judge eligible for appointment.</b> - Superior court judge must be serving as such in order to apply for an appointment as judge of the superior courts emeritus (now senior judge); however, there are two exceptions to this rule: (1) a judge of the superior courts who is eligible for appointment as a judge of the superior courts emeritus (now senior judge), but who has not yet been so appointed, who is elected or appointed to, or qualifies for, an office of profit or trust under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of Georgia, may assume such office of profit or trust, and the judge's right to appointment (the judge's eligibility) shall be suspended during the time the judge holds such office of profit or trust; and (2) any superior court judge who elects to extend retirement benefits to the judge's widow under the terms of this statute, is eligible for an appointment as a judge emeritus (now senior judge), whether or not the judge is holding office at the time of the judge's appointment by the Governor, assuming, of course, the judge has the requisite service. 1974 Op.

L. 1945, p. 362 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 8, T. 47). 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A member with at least 20 years of service shall receive retirement benefits of $1,700.00 per month upon retirement, provided that at least 12 years of such service shall have been served as a clerk, and the member must have served continuously as a clerk for the four years immediately preceding the member's retirement. Subject to the restrictions set out in this subsection, in computing such service, a member also may include service as a deputy clerk of the superior court and not more than four years of service as a member of the armed forces of the United States on active duty during any period of time in which the United States was engaged in an armed conflict, regardless of whether a state of war had been declared by Congress, provided that no service as a member of the armed forces of the United States shall be deemed as service for purposes of obtaining retirement benefits under this chapter if such service has or will be used in the determination of the member's eligibility for retirement benefits or allowances from any other state or federal retirement program, excluding social security. A clerk of the superior court may not include service for eligibility purposes for years in which the clerk has not completed the training requirements set out in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Code Section 15-6-50. No member who is subject to the provisions of Code Section 15-6-50 shall be entitled to include, for purposes of eligibility to receive a benefit under this chapter, service during which he or she was not in compliance with the training requirements of subsection (c) of such Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(c) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In lieu of the retirement benefits provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this Code section, a member, upon retirement, may elect spousal benefits. If such election is made, then the amount of the benefits paid to the member shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under subsection (a) or (b) of this Code section, as applicable. Such actuarial equivalence shall be computed on the interest rate and mortality basis approved from time to time by the board, the age of the member, and, if applicable, the age of his or her spouse as of the date benefits are to commence. After the member's death, the member's surviving spouse shall receive a monthly sum during the lifetime of the surviving spouse equal to 50 percent of the amount which the member would have received had the member elected the full benefits provided under subsections (a) and (b) of this Code section. In order to be eligible for such benefits, the surviving spouse shall have been married to the member for at least six years immediately preceding the member's death. Such benefits shall not commence until after the surviving spouse reaches 55 years of age. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) If a member elects spousal benefits under paragraph (1) of this subsection and subsequently the member's spouse predeceases the member or a final judgment of complete divorce between the member and the member's spouse is entered, the member may, in writing on forms prescribed by the board and subject to approval by the board, revoke the election for spousal benefits under paragraph (1) of this subsection and thereafter receive during the member's lifetime a monthly retirement benefit commencing on the first day of the month following the date on which the board approves such revocation, but not for any period prior to such date. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

No other type of service shall be counted toward such retirement benefits. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time a member becomes eligible for retirement benefits, he or she shall choose one of three payment options for retirement benefits. The member must indicate his or her choice of payment options upon the application for retirement benefits filed with the secretary-treasurer. Upon approval of the member's application by the board, such member shall be paid retirement benefits in the form of a monthly sum of money determined in accordance with the option he or she has selected. The three payment options are as follows: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(1) Option One shall be known as a "single life annuity" and shall provide retirement benefits for the life of the member only. If the member has no more than four years of service credited to such member under this chapter, the member shall be paid a benefit of $380.00 per month until the member's death. If the member has more than four years credited to such member under the provisions of this chapter, such member shall be paid a benefit of $380.00 per month, plus $95.00 per month for each additional year of service so credited to the member. If the member has additional service credit not totaling a full year, the further sum of one-twelfth of the amount paid per month for each additional year of service credit over four years shall be paid for each month of additional service so credited to the member; provided, however, that in no case shall such benefits exceed $2,850.00 per month; provided, further, that the board of commissioners shall be authorized to increase such benefits by an amount not to exceed 3 percent per annum based on the following factors: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(A) The recommendation of the actuary of the board of commissioners; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(B) The maintenance of the actuarial soundness of the fund in accordance with the standards provided in Code Section 47-20-10 or such higher standards as may be adopted by the board; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(C) Such other factors as the board deems relevant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p11">Any such increase may be uniform or may vary in accordance with the time of retirement, length of service, age, nature of the retirement, or such other factors as the board of commissioners shall determine; provided, however, that no such increase shall be made to become effective within six months of the effective date of any increase in the maximum retirement benefit granted by the General Assembly through amendment of this Code section; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) Option Two shall be known as a "100 percent joint life annuity" and shall provide retirement benefits for the life of either the member or his or her spouse, whichever is the survivor. The monthly amount to be paid under this option shall be based on the member's age and that of his or her spouse at the member's retirement and shall be the actuarial equivalent of the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Actuarial equivalents shall be computed using a current and accurate mortality table adopted by the board; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(3) Option Three shall be known as the "50 percent contingency life annuity" and shall provide for payment of a 50 percent benefit for the life of the surviving spouse. The amount to be paid under this option shall be based on the member's age and that of his or her spouse at the member's retirement and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly benefit which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Actuarial equivalents shall be computed using a current and accurate mortality table adopted by the board. When a retired member has elected Option Two or Option Three, in the event the spouse predeceases the retired member, the monthly retirement benefit payable to the retired member after the death of the spouse shall be increased to the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. In the event any such retired member remarries or has remarried after the death of the former spouse, the retired member may elect to begin receiving the applicable reduced retirement benefit of equivalent actuarial value and reestablish on behalf of the new spouse the same option which was applicable to the deceased former spouse, but such option on behalf of the new spouse may not be reestablished until one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA51, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Benefits payable to the spouse of a deceased member shall be payable for only so long as such spouse remains the widow or widower of such deceased member and, should such spouse remarry, any benefits payable to such spouse shall cease as of the date of remarriage. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(2) At any time after the entry of a final judgment of divorce, a retired member receiving benefits under either Option Two or Option Three may continue receiving benefits under the option so chosen for the benefit of the former spouse or may revoke the election. In the event the retired member revokes the election, the retired member shall begin receiving the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. Benefits paid under Option One to a retired member following such revocation shall not be retroactive. In the event that the retired member remarries after divorce from the former spouse and the member elected to revoke Option Two or Option Three as provided in this paragraph, the retired member may elect to begin receiving reduced monthly retirement benefits of actuarial equivalence under either Option Two or Option Three. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA5 1, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, $20.00 shall be deducted from the monthly retirement benefits of the member or the monthly retirement benefits under Option Two or Three to the spouse of the member when the member has been credited with any period of service under this chapter which was performed prior to January 1, 1961, and for which dues shall not have been paid by the member, until a total sum of $20.00 for every month of service prior to January 1, 1961, so credited to the member shall have been withheld, or until dues have been paid or withheld for a maximum of 25 years, or until the death of the member and his or her spouse who is receiving benefits, whichever may occur first. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the event any member with a spouse then living is unable to choose one of the three option payments, to complete and file an application for retirement benefits with the secretary-treasurer, or to obtain the approval of the board because of his or her death, mental incompetency, or other providential cause, but the member is otherwise eligible to receive retirement benefits except for his or her having been prevented, Option Two shall be effective, and retirement benefits shall be paid in accordance with that option. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The options under this Code section and the increase in the amounts to be paid as retirement benefits pursuant to said options shall become effective and apply from and after May 1, 1979. Those members and persons already receiving retirement benefits which were computed and determined at a time when the options were not available shall not be afforded an opportunity to select an option but shall have their retirement benefits recomputed and determined in accordance with the provisions of Option One, and the increase in benefits shall be paid to such members or persons from and after May 1, 1979. For those members or persons eligible to receive retirement benefits from and after May 1, 1979, their service shall be computed and determined in accordance with the increased retirement benefits in this Code section in accordance with the member's option selected in accordance with the provisions of this Code section and according to the number of years of creditable service credited to such member or person under this Code section, and such member shall be paid the retirement benefits so determined from and after May 1, 1979. For those members or persons already receiving retirement benefits, such members or persons shall be entitled to have their retirement benefits recomputed and determined in accordance with this Code section, and the increase in benefits according to their years of creditable service shall be paid to such members and persons from and after May 1, 1979. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payments not "costs."</b> - As to the Peace Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund and the Judges of the Probate Courts Retirement Fund, the General Assembly has drawn a plain distinction between court costs and the payments which must be made into those retirement systems. Therefore, payments which are to be made into the Peace Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund and into the Judges of the Probate Courts Retirement Fund should not be treated as part of court costs. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-29.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Moneys paid whenever costs collected.</b> - Intent of the added phrase "to include costs" in subsection (a) of this statute indicates the moneys are to be paid whenever costs are collected, whether as part of a fine, bond, or as a result of a settlement and nolle prosequi. 1963-65 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 609 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-17-60).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Collection and recording of amounts due.</b> - Collecting officer deducts the amount authorized under this statute of the Peace Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund before any moneys arising from fines and forfeitures are paid into the fine and forfeiture fund. The money so deducted is to be accurately recorded and transmitted to the treasurer of the Board of Commissioners of the Peace Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund as provided by law. 1950-51 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 131 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 47-17-60). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Records of amounts due the Peace Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund must be kept by the person or authority collecting the money. Normally, this person will be the clerk of the court. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U70-85.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment required even though no police are members.</b> - Law makes no distinction as to any court, and the fact that no police officers in a particular city are members of the fund does not remove the requirement of payment into the fund by any court of such city. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 229.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p11">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time a member qualifies for retirement payments, such member must choose a payment option provided for in this Code section. A member shall become eligible to begin receiving benefits on the first day of the month following the month in which the member qualified for retirement and terminated active employment as a peace officer. A member shall present to the secretary-treasurer a completed application form for retirement benefits. The application shall contain such information as the board shall require. After approval by the board, the secretary-treasurer shall pay to such retired member a monthly sum based on the option chosen by the member. If a married member with a spouse then living is unable to choose an option provided for in this Code section and to complete an application form because of death, mental incompetency, or other providential cause, then Option Two shall become effective. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Option One shall consist of a single life annuity payable in monthly payments for the life of the member only. The monthly payment under this option shall be an amount equal to $17.50 per month for each full year of creditable service and in the event the member shall have additional service credit not totaling a full year, the further sum of one-twelfth of the amount paid per month for each additional year of service credit shall be paid for each month of additional service credit, provided that the member either has at least ten years of membership service, or 15 years for members who become members on or after July 1, 2010, and is at least 55 years of age or has at least 30 years of creditable service, regardless of age. Such monthly benefit payment shall be paid on each full year and additional full months of creditable service up to a maximum of 30 years of total service. No member shall be eligible for benefits under this option until the member's official duties as a peace officer have been terminated, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and unless the member files an application for retirement benefits within 90 days from the date of the termination of the member's official duties as a peace officer, unless prevented therefrom for good cause. If such member shall qualify for retirement benefits in every respect except for completion of payment of monthly dues for the periods of time for which the member has received service credit, dues shall be deducted from the member's monthly benefit check until such dues have been paid in full. Any member who has at least ten years of membership service, or 15 years for members who become members on or after July 1, 2010, for which dues have been fully paid but who has not reached 55 years of age may cease paying monthly dues into the fund if the member's employment as a peace officer is terminated; and upon reaching 55 years of age the member may be eligible to receive retirement benefits under this option. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Option Two shall consist of a 100 percent joint life annuity payable during the life of the member or the member's spouse. The amount of monthly payment to be paid under this option shall be based on the date the member first becomes eligible to receive pension benefits (normal retirement date) and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Such actuarial equivalence shall be computed on the interest rate and mortality basis approved from time to time by the board, the age of the member, and, if applicable, the age of his or her spouse as of the date benefits are to commence or as of the date benefits would have commenced if the member had retired after first becoming eligible for full benefits, whichever is earlier. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Option Three shall consist of a contingency life annuity with a 50 percent monthly payment to the surviving spouse. The amount of monthly payment to be paid under this option shall be based on the date the member first becomes eligible to receive pension benefits (normal retirement date) and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Such actuarial equivalence shall be computed on the interest rate and mortality basis approved from time to time by the board, the age of the member, and, if applicable, the age of his or her spouse as of the date benefits are to commence or as of the date benefits would have commenced if the member had retired after first becoming eligible for full benefits, whichever is earlier. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(2) Under Option Two or Three, a retired member may revoke the election of any such option at any time after the entry of a final judgment of complete divorce from the retired member's spouse or the retired member may elect to continue under Option Two or Three for the benefit of the former spouse. Upon any such revocation, the retired member shall begin receiving the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. In the event any such retired member remarries after divorce from the former spouse and the retired member elected to revoke Option Two or Three as provided in this paragraph, the retired member may elect to begin receiving the applicable reduced monthly retirement benefit of equivalent actuarial value and reestablish on behalf of the new spouse the same option which was applicable to the former spouse. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA51, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions. The option on behalf of the new spouse may not be exercised until one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(e.1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When a retired member has elected Option Two or Option Three, then in the event the spouse predeceases the retired member, the monthly retirement benefit payable to the retired member after the death of the spouse shall be increased to the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. In the event any such retired member remarries or has remarried after the death of the former spouse, the retired member may elect to begin receiving the applicable reduced retirement benefit of equivalent actuarial value and reestablish on behalf of the new spouse the same option which was applicable to the deceased former spouse, but such option on behalf of the new spouse may not be reestablished until one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier. Actuarial equivalence under this subsection shall be determined in the same manner that it is determined under paragraph (2) of subsection (e) of this Code section. This subsection applies to retired members who retired at any time prior to July 1, 1990, as well as to those who retire on or after that date, but increases in monthly retirement benefits authorized by this subsection shall not be paid retroactively for any period of time prior to July 1, 1990, notwithstanding the fact that a spouse covered under Option Two or Option Three may have died prior to July 1, 1990. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing contained in this Code section shall affect the requirement that a member make payments into the fund for a minimum period of ten years, or 15 years for members who become members on or after July 1, 2010, nor shall it affect the requirement that credit for service after March 1, 1951, shall not be given unless the member has made the required payments to the fund for all such service. Any peace officer becoming a member of the fund between April 1, 1953, and March 31, 1965, inclusive, must remain an active member and, in addition to completing the required years of service, must remit the correct amount of dues to the fund for a period of three years from the date he or she becomes a member, irrespective of previous service credited for which dues are paid, before being eligible for any retirement benefits provided under this Code section. Any peace officer becoming a member of the fund for the first time on or after April 1, 1965, must remain an active member and, in addition to completing the required years of service, must remit the correct amount of dues to the fund for a period of five years from the date he or she becomes a member, irrespective of previous service credited for which dues are paid, before being eligible for any retirement benefits provided under this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11">(g) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, any member who again becomes employed as a peace officer after having been placed on retirement under this Code section shall immediately notify the secretary-treasurer of such reemployment. Retirement benefits being paid to such member shall be terminated as of the date of such reemployment and shall remain terminated for the duration of such reemployment. During such period of reemployment, said member shall pay regular monthly dues into this fund. Upon meeting the requirements provided by law, such member shall be entitled to all benefits provided for in Code Sections 47-17-81 and 47-17-82; but such member shall not be entitled to any increase in retirement benefits by virtue of service during the period of reemployment unless such reemployment is for a term of three years or more, in which instance such member may again apply for retirement as if he or she had not previously been retired; and he or she shall be entitled to such benefits as may be provided by law at that time, if he or she so chooses. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p11">(3) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to a member otherwise qualified for a normal service retirement under this chapter with at least 30 years of creditable service and who has attained the age of 55. Any such member may continue or reenter employment as a peace officer and shall for all purposes be considered a retired member of this fund; provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any person who first or again becomes a member on or after July 1, 2009. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
