L. 1972, p. 193, <span class="s1">§</span> 10, effective July 1, 1972, not codified by the General Assembly, provided that the purpose of the Act was to reduce the age of legal majority from 21 years of age to 18 years of age so that all persons, upon reaching the age of 18, would have the rights, privileges, powers, duties, responsibilities, and liabilities previously applicable to persons 21 years of age or over. The section further provided that the Act was not to be construed to have the effect of changing the age from 21 to 18 with respect to any legal instrument or court decree in existence prior to July 1, 1972, when the instrument referred only to "the age of majority" or words of similar import, except that any guardianship of the person or property of a minor under the provisions of Title 49 of the 1933 Code, whether such guardianship was created by court order or decree entered before or after July 1, 1972, or under the will of a testator which was executed after July 1, 1972, would terminate when the ward for whom such guardianship was created reached 18 years of age. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Computation.</b> - One becomes of full age on the day preceding the twenty-first (now eighteenth) anniversary of one's birth, on the first moment of that day. Thomas v. Couch, 171 Ga. 602, 156 S.E. 206 (1930) (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ordered support beyond eighteenth birthday a nullity.</b> - Any portion of a verdict and judgment intending to provide for support for any child beyond his or her eighteenth birthday is a nullity. Wilcox v. Wilcox, 242 Ga. 598, 250 S.E.2d 465 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parental consent necessary for imposition of support obligation beyond 18.</b> - Without the consent of the husband-father in a child support controversy, neither the jury nor the court can require him to support his minor child beyond the child's eighteenth birthday, and an attempt to do so is a nullity. Ritchea v. Ritchea, 244 Ga. 476, 260 S.E.2d 871 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Support beyond reduced age of majority in accordance with original agreement.</b> - When the age of majority at the time of divorce was 21, it was proper to continue child support in accordance with the original agreement even though the statute reduced the age of majority to 18. Spivey v. Schneider, 234 Ga. 687, 217 S.E.2d 251 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery of support by adult child barred.</b> - Right in an adult child to recover support from his father (now parent) beyond the age of majority was barred by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 74-104 and 74-105 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 39-1-1 and 19-7-2, respectively) which provide together that a father's (now parent's) obligation to provide for the maintenance, protection, and education of his child ceases when the child reaches majority. Crane v. Crane, 225 Ga. 605, 170 S.E.2d 392 (1969), (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No modification of Juvenile Court Code.</b> - Reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18 did not modify the provisions of the Juvenile Court Code, which still applies to those under the age of 21 years who have committed an act of delinquency before reaching the age of 17. W.F. v. State, 144 Ga. App. 523, 241 S.E.2d 631 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Minors may not refuse unwanted care.</b> - Georgia provides no "mature minor" exception to the state's general rule that only adults may refuse unwanted medical care. Novak v. Cobb County-Kennestone Hosp. Auth., 849 F. Supp. 1559 (N.D. Ga. 1994), aff'd, 74 F.3d 1173 (11th Cir. 1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Workers' compensation.</b> - Provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 34-9-1 et seq., are manifestly general and not special laws and operate uniformly upon all minors who are employed under such circumstances as to come under the Workers' Compensation Act, who are 18 years of age or over, and who are not mentally incompetent or physically incapable of earning a livelihood. The legislature has ample power to regulate the age of minority or majority, and may divide minors into two classes, those above and those below a certain age, and endow all those above such age with all the rights of adults in reference to certain kinds of contracts without violating the provision of the Constitution. The effect of such an Act is merely to provide that in reference to certain kinds of contracts the age of majority shall be 18 instead of 21 years. Rourke v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 187 Ga. 636, 1 S.E.2d 728 (1939) (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Confessions and statements of juveniles.</b> - West v. United States, 399 F.2d 467 (5th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1102, 89 S. Ct. 903, 21 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1969), which enumerates factors applying to confessions or statements of juveniles is inapposite if the defendant is 18 years or older. White v. State, 251 Ga. 482, 306 S.E.2d 636 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Negligence question of fact.</b> - In a case not covered by the statute, the question of the defendant's negligence in employing the young person at the particular occupation is usually one for the jury. Platt v. Southern Photo Material Co., 4 Ga. App. 159, 60 S.E. 1068 (1908), (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3149(1)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Accepting employment not contributory negligence.</b> - Minor under the age of 14 years, by accepting employment in a cotton mill in violation of statute, is not guilty of contributory negligence proximately causing injuries. International Cotton Mills v. Burnham, 284 F. 351 (5th Cir. 1922) (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3149(1)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assumption of risks.</b> - Statutory prohibition against employing children under a prescribed age in a factory excludes the defense of the assumptions by the children of risks incident to such employment. Ransom v. Nunnally Co., 26 Ga. App. 222, 105 S.E. 822 (1921), (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3149(1)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Diligence required of children.</b> - Diligence required of children of tender years is not to be measured by the ordinary care required of an adult; but due care in such a child is such care as its capacity, mental and physical, fits it for exercising in the actual circumstances of the occasion and situation. Infants under 14 years of age are chargeable with contributory negligence resulting from a want of such care, and assuming the risk of those patent, obvious, and known dangers which the infants are able to appreciate and avoid. Evans v. Mills, 119 Ga. 448, 46 S.E. 674 (1904), (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3149(1)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fellow-servant doctrine not applicable.</b> - As a general rule, the master is not liable to one servant for injuries inflicted by a fellow servant because the risk thereof is one of those assumed in the contract of employment. But this doctrine does not apply to infants of tender years and the question of such negligence should be submitted to the jury. Evans v. Mills, 119 Ga. 448, 46 S.E. 674 (1904), (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3149(1)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Savannah Kaolin Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 35 Ga. App. 24, 131 S.E. 919 (1926), (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3149(1)).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Sumary judgment upheld as to premises owner.</b> - In a wrongful death action premised on both negligence and negligence per se filed on behalf of a mother's deceased minor son, a premises owner was properly granted summary judgment, as the independent contractor that hired the decedent, and not the premises owner, had sole control over the contractor's personnel, and the son's hazardous occupation on the owner's premises for a third party did not in and of itself demonstrate that the owner was in violation of Georgia's child labor laws; thus, the appeals court declined to reach the issue of whether an owner who knew or had reason to know that its independent contractor was employing a minor under the age of 16 to perform a dangerous occupation on the owner's premises was in violation of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 39-2-2.

Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability in adoption proceedings.</b> - When persons seeking to adopt obtained a valid surrender, but were legally precluded from adopting in Georgia, the trial court should have transferred custody to them in order to assist in their pursuit of an Alabama adoption; such action would have been consistent with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 39-4-4,, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, O.C.G.A.
