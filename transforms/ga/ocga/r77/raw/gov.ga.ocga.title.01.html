<p class="p8">The enactment of this Code is intended as a recodification, revision, modernization, and reenactment of the general laws of the State of Georgia which are currently of force and is intended, where possible, to resolve conflicts which exist in the law and to repeal those laws which are obsolete as a result of the passage of time or other causes, which have been declared unconstitutional or invalid, or which have been superseded by the enactment of later laws. Except as otherwise specifically provided by particular provisions of this Code, the enactment of this Code by the General Assembly is not intended to alter the substantive law in existence on the effective date of this Code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Alteration of substantive law not intended.</b> - The primary purpose of the new codification was to rearrange the statutes as previously enacted by the General Assembly into a meaningful and cohesive order, a conclusion supported by language in this section that the Code "is not intended to alter the substantive laws in existence on the effective date of this Code."

</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 102-101, which adopted the Code of Georgia of 1933, are included in the annotations for this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Three-minute rule remains unchanged.</b> - Although the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) specifically repealed the Code of 1933, the Rules of the Superior Court were not a part of that repealed code even though they "conveniently" appeared therein. The three-minute rule is one of long standing, originally promulgated pursuant to authority given by law and never specifically repealed by the General Assembly. As such, the three-minute rule remains viable and unchanged by the adoption of the O.C.G.A. Hinson v. Castellio, 168 Ga. App. 301, 308 S.E.2d 705 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statutory offense of failing to pay for agricultural products repealed.</b> - The enactment of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated repealed the statute governing the offense of failing to pay for agricultural products, and thus, absent a saving provision, the prosecution for such an offense which had not reached final judgment was properly dismissed. State v. Fordham, 172 Ga. App. 853, 324 S.E.2d 796 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Effect of Code's adoption.</b> - The legislative Act in adopting the 1933 Code had the force and effect of enacting into one statute all the provisions in that Code. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Wise, 190 Ga. 254, 9 S.E.2d 63 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Effect of Code's adoption was to enact into one statute all provisions embraced in Code. Head v. Browning, 215 Ga. 263, 109 S.E.2d 798 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Legislative intention.</b> - Just as is the rule in construing statutes, where a section is plain, unambiguous, and positive, and is not capable of two constructions, the court is not authorized to construe it according to what is supposed to be the intention of the General Assembly. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Wise, 190 Ga. 254, 9 S.E.2d 63 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Section normally states existing law.</b> - While it is true that the adoption by the General Assembly of the Code of 1933 amounted to a reenactment of each section thereof as contemporary statutes, it is also true that in construing the meaning of an ambiguous section, the original Act will be looked to in order to determine the true interpretation of the section; and in such an interpretation of an ambiguous section having the force of a statute, unless the contrary manifestly appears from the words employed, the language of such section should be construed as intending to state the previously existing law, and not to change it. State v. Camp, 189 Ga. 209, 6 S.E.2d 299 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Unless contrary manifestly appears from words employed, section should be understood as stating existing law, and not changing it. Maddox v. First Nat'l Bank, 191 Ga. 106, 11 S.E.2d 662 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Where, by the language of the section itself, its context, and by reason of the expressed subject matter under which it is grouped, it becomes proper and necessary to determine the true intent of the legislative body, it will be construed in the light of the source from which it came, to the extent that the language of the section itself may be compatible with such a construction; in such a case, where the section has been codified from a decision of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, the section will be construed, insofar as is compatible with its terms, so as to conform to the then existing law, rather than to change the rule in force at the time the Code was adopted. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Wise, 190 Ga. 254, 9 S.E.2d 63 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Where an intention to change appears, it must be given effect,</b> not because of any power of legislation vested in the codifiers or the commission, but because of the adopting statute. Maddox v. First Nat'l Bank, 191 Ga. 106, 11 S.E.2d 662 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Proposed change must be conspicuous</b> so as to demand inference that it was noticed by the lawmaking body before the presumption against a change may be overthrown. Maddox v. First Nat'l Bank, 191 Ga. 106, 11 S.E.2d 662 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Related sections should be construed to harmonize each other.</b> - The adoption of the Code of 1933 amounted to a reenactment of each section as contemporary statutes of the state, and each section should be dealt with as though it were contained in the same Act of the General Assembly and should be construed as if it was a separate paragraph of the same statute. Therefore, sections relating to the same subject matter and codified at the same time should be construed, if possible, to harmonize with each other, and that construction should be adopted which will prevent a contradiction by one section of the other, so that both will be operative. Grand Trunk W.R.R. v. Barge, 75 Ga. App. 646, 44 S.E.2d 281 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sections in irreconcilable conflict.</b> - Where two sections of the Code are found to be in irreconcilable conflict, and both sections are derived from Acts of the General Assembly, this conflict must be settled by resort to the original Acts from which the conflicting sections are derived, and that section which is derived from the later Act of the General Assembly must control. Thomas v. Hudson, 190 Ga. 622, 10 S.E.2d 396 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sovereign immunity now a matter of constitutional law.</b> - Although sovereign immunity and official immunity under common law was given constitutional status, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Para. IX, it was the common law doctrines that were given constitutional status, and courts no longer have authority to abrogate or modify the doctrines. Lathrop v. Deal, 301 Ga. 408, 801 S.E.2d 867 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>State empowered to deny any citizen any right.</b> - One who is a citizen does not necessarily have the right to exercise all the rights exercised by any citizen. It is within the power of the state, by proper methods, to deny to any citizen any right. But that denial must be made by the proper authority. White v. Clements, 39 Ga. 232 (1869).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Naturalized citizen stands upon the same footing as other citizens,</b> and the naturalized citizen has all the rights anybody has - unless it is otherwise specially provided by law. White v. Clements, 39 Ga. 232 (1869).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Rights of each race</b> are controlled and governed by same enactments or principles of law. Smith v. Dubose, 78 Ga. 413, 3 S.E. 309, 6 Am. St. R. 260 (1887).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Mentally and physically disabled person found competent.</b> - Though a victim of sexual assault was mentally and physically disabled, a trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in determining that the victim was competent to testify against the defendant at the defendant's criminal trial because the trial court held a competency hearing and found that the victim understood the victim's responsibility to tell the truth and clearly knew what had happened, who had done it, and so communicated those facts, despite the victim's mental and physical disabilities. Wilson v. State, 270 Ga. App. 311, 605 S.E.2d 921 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statute is presumed to be valid and constitutional until the contrary appears,</b> and, where challenged as a whole, the attack will necessarily fail unless the statute is invalid in every part for some reason alleged. Williams v. Ragsdale, 205 Ga. 274, 53 S.E.2d 339 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">A solemn Act of the General Assembly is presumed to be constitutional. State v. Davis, 246 Ga. 761, 272 S.E.2d 721 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">A statute properly enacted is presumed to be constitutional. Development Auth. v. Beverly Enters., 247 Ga. 64, 274 S.E.2d 324 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">An Act of the General Assembly carries a strong presumption of constitutionality, and therefore should not be set aside unless it "plainly and palpably" conflicts with a constitutional provision. City of Atlanta v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 636 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statute must be construed with reference to whole system</b> of which it is a part. Allison v. Domain, 158 Ga. App. 542, 281 S.E.2d 299 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction which will give effect to a statute or rule is preferred</b> to a construction which will destroy it. Brown v. State Merit Sys. of Personnel Admin., 245 Ga. 239, 264 S.E.2d 186 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>That construction which will uphold a statute in whole and in every part is preferred.</b> Exum v. City of Valdosta, 246 Ga. 169, 269 S.E.2d 441 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Subdivision (d)(3) has no application in criminal prosecution.</b> - In a prosecution of a county deputy for sexual battery and false imprisonment, an indictment filed on May 30, 2014, two years after the incidents that took place on May 30, 2012, was filed a day after the expiration of the statute of limitation, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-3-1(e); O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(d)(3) did not apply in a criminal prosecution. State v. Dorsey, 342 Ga. App. 188, 802 S.E.2d 61 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Specific sentencing provisions controlled over general sentencing provisions.</b> - Pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-13-31(g)(1), the trial court lacked the authority to probate or suspend sentences imposed against two defendants in unrelated criminal actions, and neither the 2004 nor the 2006 amendments to the general sentencing provisions under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-10-1(a)(1) were relevant; moreover, because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 17-10-6.1 and 17-10-6.2 were statutes that defined certain categories of crimes and provided the sentencing guidelines for those categories, it did not appear that the list of these two exceptions normally would have included <span class="s1">§</span> 16-13-31 or any other specific criminal statute, and any omission would be significant only with regard to a statute that defined classes or categories of crimes. Gillen v. State, 286 Ga. App. 616, 649 S.E.2d 832 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1780, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 809 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Courts not to "read out" part of statute.</b> - It is contrary to the generally accepted principles for construing statutes to "read out" any part of the statute as "mere surplusage" unless there is a clear reason for doing so. Porter v. Food Giant, Inc., 198 Ga. App. 736, 402 S.E.2d 766 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 980, 112 S. Ct. 582, 116 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction which renders ordinance or resolution valid preferred.</b> - In construing an ordinance or resolution of a governmental unit, if the language is susceptible of more than one construction, that construction is preferred which will render it valid rather than invalid. Mayor of Hapeville v. Anderson, 246 Ga. 786, 272 S.E.2d 713 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>It is courts' duty</b> to put construction upon statutes, if possible, and to uphold them and carry them into effect. Lamons v. Yarbrough, 206 Ga. 50, 55 S.E.2d 551 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">It is the duty of the court in construing an ambiguous statute to give it a construction, if the language permits, that will sustain the Act, rather than a construction that will render it invalid. Jones v. City of College Park, 223 Ga. 778, 158 S.E.2d 384 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Act's constitutionality determined by examining Act existing at time of offense.</b> - The constitutionality of an Act of the General Assembly must be determined by the examination of the Act as it existed at the time of the alleged offense, not by an examination of an isolated section of the Code. Stewart v. State, 246 Ga. 70, 268 S.E.2d 906 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statutes construed in connection and in harmony with existing law.</b> - All statutes are presumed to be enacted by the General Assembly with full knowledge of the existing condition of the law and with reference to it. New statutes are therefore to be construed in connection and in harmony with the existing law. McPherson v. City of Dawson, 221 Ga. 861, 148 S.E.2d 298 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">All statutes are presumed to be enacted by the General Assembly with full knowledge of the existing condition of the law and with reference to it; new statutes are to be construed in connection and in harmony with the existing law, and their meaning and effect will be determined in connection with not only the common law and the Constitution, but also with reference to other statutes and the decisions of the courts. State v. Davis, 246 Ga. 761, 272 S.E.2d 721 (1980); Allison v. Domain, 158 Ga. App. 542, 281 S.E.2d 299 (1981); Wigley v. Hambrick, 193 Ga. App. 903, 389 S.E.2d 763 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">When O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 15-11-40(b), 15-11-63(e)(1)(D) and (e)(2)(c) were read together to effectuate their meaning, as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(a), the juvenile court did not err in denying a juvenile's motion to commute or reduce the sentence imposed, as allegations that the juvenile was rehabilitated while in restrictive custody and would benefit from being released were insufficient to grant the juvenile court authority to modify its commitment order once physical custody of the juvenile was transferred to the Department of Juvenile Justice. In the Interest of J.V., 282 Ga. App. 319, 638 S.E.2d 757 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>A statute must be viewed so as to make all its parts harmonize</b> and to give a sensible and intelligent effect to each part. Osborn v. State, 161 Ga. App. 132, 291 S.E.2d 22 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction cannot render statute meaningless.</b> - Construing O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-10-94(c), and in order to avoid rendering the terms "and involving another person" meaningless, the court had to interpret that language as imposing felony punishment when the person committed the tampering offense involving the prosecution or defense of a third person; hence, because the state did not present any allegations or evidence indicating that the defendant committed the tampering offense to prevent the apprehension or prosecution of anyone other than the defendant, the felony sentence imposed was void, and had to be vacated. English v. State, 282 Ga. App. 552, 639 S.E.2d 551 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Courts cannot construe plain statutes.</b> - If a statute is plain and susceptible of but one construction, the courts have no authority to place a different construction on it, but must apply it according to its terms. Thompson v. Georgia Power Co., 73 Ga. App. 587, 37 S.E.2d 622 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Courts of last resort must frequently construe the language of a statute, but they may not substitute by judicial interpretation language of their own for the clear, unambiguous language of the statute, so as to change the meaning. Frazier v. Southern Ry., 200 Ga. 590, 37 S.E.2d 774 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Where the language of an Act is plain and unequivocal, judicial construction is not only unnecessary but is forbidden. City of Jesup v. Bennett, 226 Ga. 606, 176 S.E.2d 81 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Certain express requirements must be spelled out in statute.</b> - A county historic preservation commission's decision was not void because the commission did not have seven members as required by an ordinance. Neither the ordinance nor the Historical Preservation Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-10-20 et seq., provided that failure to have seven active members invalidated a decision; such an express requirement was necessary under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(c). DeKalb County v. Buckler, 288 Ga. App. 346, 654 S.E.2d 193 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0514, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 374 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Gender references.</b> - For construction purposes, the state's act of merely tracking the language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-10-24(a), which itself used the masculine pronoun "his" to include the feminine gender, did not result in a fatal variance between the evidence at trial and the allegations of the accusation, in a case involving a female officer, entitling both defendants to a directed verdict on the charges of which the defendants were eventually convicted. Curtis v. State, 285 Ga. App. 298, 645 S.E.2d 705 (2007), overruled on other grounds by McClure v. State, 306 Ga. 856, 834 S.E.2d 96 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Plain and ordinary meaning.</b> - It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that the court must give words their plain and ordinary meaning, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(b); therefore, because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-12-61 recites explicitly that revival of a dormant judgment may be accomplished by "an action" within three years of when the judgment became dormant, not by "a judgment" within that time period, the General Assembly intended that dormant judgments could be revived during a three year period thereafter by bringing an action into existence, i.e., filing an action. Magnum Communs. Ltd. v. Samoluk, 275 Ga. App. 177, 620 S.E.2d 439 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In an action in which the plaintiff consumer filed a complaint under the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act (FBPA), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-390 et seq., and the Georgia Unfair or Deceptive Practices Toward the Elderly Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-850 et seq., and the lender argued for dismissal because the language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-851 required conduct directed at more than one elderly person, the argument was rejected; consistent with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(d)(6), and the use of plurals or the singular form in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 10-1-850, 10-1-852, and 10-1-853, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-851 required only a showing that FBPA was violated against one elderly person. Kitchen v. Ameriquest Mortg. Co.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga. Apr. 29, 2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Trial court properly reversed a decision by the Georgia Workers' Compensation Appellate Division and reinstated a decision of an administrative law judge who found that an employee suffered a "catastrophic injury" for purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 34-9-200.1(g)(6), as the employee was unable to perform the prior work done, although the employee was able to perform other work available in substantial numbers within the national economy; the relevant provision of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 34-9-200.1(g)(6) used "or" between the two types of work that an employee could perform rather than "and" and that phraseology was deemed unambiguous, plain, and capable of having only one meaning, based on statutory interpretation rules under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(a) and legislative changes over time to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 34-9-200.1(g)(6). Rite-Aid Corp. v. Davis, 280 Ga. App. 522, 634 S.E.2d 480 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Under the plain and ordinary language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-6-72(d)(1), a bondsman who failed to assist in the arrest of the principal of its bond was not entitled to a 50 percent remission of the bond, and the district attorney's consent to the bondsman's motion had no legal effect, as such was not accepted by the trial court. Joe Ray Bonding Co. v. State of Ga., 284 Ga. App. 687, 644 S.E.2d 501 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Pursuant to the cardinal rule of statutory construction of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(a), the plaintiffs had no standing to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>challenge <br>
the facial constitutionality of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-11-34.2(b)(2) and (b)(4), the funeral picketing statute, because the plaintiffs admitted that the plaintiffs did not intend to impede, disrupt, or interfere with any funerals; thus, without mens rea, there was no real risk of being prosecuted and the plaintiffs had not been threatened with arrest. Hood v. Perdue, 540 F. Supp. 2d 1350 (N.D. Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>In construing conflicting legitimation statutes,</b> which permitted a jury trial (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 19-7-22), with paternity statute, which expressly prohibited a jury trial (O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 19-7-40), and due to the fact that the two proceedings were consolidated, the legislative ban on jury trials provided for in the paternity statute had to prevail as to hold otherwise would allow a party to thwart the paternity statute's goals of identifying the father and making sure the father paid child support. Banks v. Hopson, 275 Ga. 758, 571 S.E.2d 730 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>"Bribery" has clear definition.</b> - Within the context of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-10-2(a)(2), it is only "gifts" which are excepted from the purview thereof and not "bribes," no matter how small the amount involved; accordingly, where a trial court construed <span class="s1">§</span> 16-10-2 and held that small amounts of cash that added up to less than $100, which were accepted by defendant, a detention officer, from inmates, were specifically excepted from the offense of bribery, it did not construe the statute using the ordinary meaning of the words pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-1(b), which was error. State v. Fortner, 264 Ga. App. 783, 592 S.E.2d 454 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Any portion of body of laws may be invoked to ascertain meaning of another part.</b> Royal Indem. Co. v. Agnew, 66 Ga. App. 377, 18 S.E.2d 57 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Clause's meaning manifested by context and subject matter.</b> - The meaning of a clause in a statute depends upon the intention with which it is used as manifested by the context and considered with reference to the subject matter to which it relates. Thomas v. MacNeill, 200 Ga. 418, 37 S.E.2d 705 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Gore v. State, 79 Ga. App. 696, 54 S.E.2d 669 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>"May" sometimes construed as mandatory.</b> - In statutory construction, "may" is construed as mandatory when the statute concerns the public interest, or affects the rights of third persons. Great N. Nekoosa Corp. v. Board of Tax Assessors, 244 Ga. 624, 261 S.E.2d 346 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statutes generally receive prospective rather than retrospective application.</b> - Statutes framed in general terms and not plainly indicating the contrary will be construed prospectively, so as to apply to persons, subjects, and things within their purview and scope coming into existence subsequent to their enactment. Undercofler v. Swint, 111 Ga. App. 117, 140 S.E.2d 894 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Repeal of valid statute by implication.</b> - A valid subsisting statute is not repealed by implication by a later Act unless they are generally inconsistent or unless the later Act covers the entire field of the former legislation. Taylor v. R.O.A. Motors, Inc., 108 Ga. App. 635, 134 S.E.2d 486 (1963). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Repeals by implication are not favored by law, and a subsequent statute repeals prior legislative Acts by implication only when they are clearly and indubitably contradictory, when they are in irreconcilable conflict with each other, and when they cannot reasonably stand together. Sutton v. Garmon, 245 Ga. 685, 266 S.E.2d 497 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Each case involving judicial transaction of sections stands on own facts.</b> - A section involving civil law is frequently a compendium of the legal technique involved in the subject matter in question. The translation of sections is reflected by the courts in decisions rendered relative to the sections and are sometimes seemingly paradoxical, but a sincere student of the law will be able to readily discern and agree that in many fields of law each case must stand upon its own facts. Bromberg v. Drake, 91 Ga. App. 118, 85 S.E.2d 160 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction is not for jury.</b> - What is proper construction to be given to a statute is for court and not for jury. City of Fitzgerald v. Newcomer, 162 Ga. App. 646, 291 S.E.2d 766 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When section plain and positive, court cannot construe legislative intent.</b> - Just as is the rule in construing statutes, where a section is plain, unambiguous, and positive, and is not capable of two constructions, the court is not authorized to construe it according to what is supposed to be the intention of the General Assembly. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Wise, 190 Ga. 254, 9 S.E.2d 63 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statute not construed literally where legislative purpose defeated.</b> - An exception to the general rule that the use of plain and unequivocal language in a legislative enactment obviates any necessity for judicial construction is presented by the use of words the meaning of which in general acceptation is apparently obvious, and yet the purpose of the General Assembly would be defeated were the words employed construed literally. Bibb County v. Hancock, 211 Ga. 429, 86 S.E.2d 511 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Where to construe an Act of the General Assembly in a particular way would, while hewing to its literal terms, result in defeating the obvious legislative purposes and intent, such construction will not be given where an obvious typographical or clerical error can be corrected so as to carry out the intent.

<p class="p6">Courts may construe the language employed in the Act in connection with the context, and ascertain the legislative intent as derived from the old law, the evil, and the remedy, and will not defeat the intention and purpose of the General Assembly by giving effect to words which would render the purpose of the General Assembly in the passage of the enactment futile, unenforceable, or ineffectual.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Courts obligated to refrain from ascribing unreasonable intention to General Assembly.</b> - Even though the literal language of an Act may be plain and unequivocal, it is the duty of the courts, in determining the legislative intent, to refrain from ascribing to the General Assembly a wholly unreasonable intention or an intention to do a futile and useless thing.

<p class="p6"><b>Statute's general language restrained where absurdity results.</b> - To give effect to the intention of the General Assembly, courts are not controlled by the literal meaning of the language of the statute, but the spirit or intention of the law prevails over the letter thereof. Where the letter of the statute results in absurdity or injustice or would lead to contradictions, the meaning of general language may be restrained by the spirit or reason of the statute. Sirmans v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Preservation of Act preferred.</b> - It is the duty of the court to arrive at the legislative intent, and, in doing so, it should not adopt an arbitrary rule that the General Assembly intended to make a typographical or clerical error, the result of which would be to make nonsense of the Act and not carry out the legislative scheme, but to destroy it. Lamons v. Yarbrough, 206 Ga. 50, 55 S.E.2d 551 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Statute's intent not defeated where mistaken reference to another statute.</b> - In case of a mistake in a reference in a statute to another statute, where the real intent of the General Assembly is manifest and would be defeated by an adherence to the terms of the mistaken reference, and the Act is otherwise a complete Act within itself, the mistaken reference will be regarded as surplusage, or will be read and corrected, in order to give effect to the legislative intent.

<p class="p6"><b>Legislation's scheme and purport criterion for determining enactment's meaning.</b> - One proper criterion for determining the meaning of a legislative enactment is to consider the general scheme and purport of the proposed legislation.

<p class="p6"><b>Old law, mischief, and remedy considered at arriving at legislative intention.</b> - This section directs that statutes be construed with reference to the intention of the General Assembly, and that the old law, the mischief, and the remedy be considered to arrive at that intention.

<p class="p6">To ascertain the intention of the General Assembly, after examining the words of the Act itself, it is necessary to take into view every fact and circumstance that influenced its passage. The court must consider what the law was before, the mischiefs against which the law did not provide, the nature of the remedy proposed, and the true reason of the remedy. McGuire v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Larger and more extensive statutory expression controls.</b> - Where a particular expression in one part of a statute is not so extensive or large in its import as other expressions in the same statute, it must yield to the larger and more extensive expression, where the latter embodies the real intent of the General Assembly. Board of Trustees v. Christy, 246 Ga. 553, 272 S.E.2d 288 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>One of two provisos should not be rejected as senseless or superfluous.</b> - The rule of construction that effect is to be given to all the words of a statute forbids that two provisos should be treated as having no more scope or significance than one of them would have if standing alone. It is better to wait for a legislative amendment than to arbitrarily reject one of the provisos as senseless or superfluous. Butterworth v.

<p class="p6"><b>Statutes "in pari materia" construed together.</b> - It is an elementary rule of statutory construction that a statute must be construed in relation to other statutes of which it is a part, and all statutes relating to the same subject matter, briefly called statutes "in pari materia," are construed together and harmonized wherever possible, so as to ascertain the legislative intendment and give effect thereto.

<p class="p6"><b>Except where language clear.</b> - Statutes in pari materia may not be resorted to where language under consideration is clear, but where the terms of the statute to be construed are ambiguous or its significance is of a doubtful character, it becomes necessary to give proper consideration to other related statutes in order to ascertain the legislative intent in reference to the whole system of laws of which the doubtful statute is a part.

<p class="p6"><b>Unclear law construed in light of whole system of laws.</b> - While the Supreme Court recognizes the rule that statutes in pari materia may not be resorted to where the language of the statute under consideration is clear, it is equally as well settled that, where the terms of the statute to be construed are ambiguous or its significance is of a doubtful character, it becomes necessary to give proper consideration to other related statutes in order to ascertain the legislative intent in reference to the whole system of laws of which the doubtful statute is a part.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Statute not construed literally where legislative purpose defeated.</b> - An exception to the general rule that the use of plain and unequivocal language in a legislative enactment obviates any necessity for judicial construction is presented by the use of words the meaning of which in general acceptation is apparently obvious, and yet the purpose of the General Assembly would be defeated were the words employed construed literally. Bibb County v. Hancock, 211 Ga. 429, 86 S.E.2d 511 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6">Courts may construe the language employed in the Act in connection with the context, and ascertain the legislative intent as derived from the old law, the evil, and the remedy, and will not defeat the intention and purpose of the General Assembly by giving effect to words which would render the purpose of the General Assembly in the passage of the enactment futile, unenforceable, or ineffectual.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Courts obligated to refrain from ascribing unreasonable intention to General Assembly.</b> - Even though the literal language of an Act may be plain and unequivocal, it is the duty of the courts, in determining the legislative intent, to refrain from ascribing to the General Assembly a wholly unreasonable intention or an intention to do a futile and useless thing.

<p class="p6"><b>Statute's general language restrained where absurdity results.</b> - To give effect to the intention of the General Assembly, courts are not controlled by the literal meaning of the language of the statute, but the spirit or intention of the law prevails over the letter thereof. Where the letter of the statute results in absurdity or injustice or would lead to contradictions, the meaning of general language may be restrained by the spirit or reason of the statute. Sirmans v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Preservation of Act preferred.</b> - It is the duty of the court to arrive at the legislative intent, and, in doing so, it should not adopt an arbitrary rule that the General Assembly intended to make a typographical or clerical error, the result of which would be to make nonsense of the Act and not carry out the legislative scheme, but to destroy it. Lamons v. Yarbrough, 206 Ga. 50, 55 S.E.2d 551 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Statute's intent not defeated where mistaken reference to another statute.</b> - In case of a mistake in a reference in a statute to another statute, where the real intent of the General Assembly is manifest and would be defeated by an adherence to the terms of the mistaken reference, and the Act is otherwise a complete Act within itself, the mistaken reference will be regarded as surplusage, or will be read and corrected, in order to give effect to the legislative intent.

<p class="p6"><b>Legislation's scheme and purport criterion for determining enactment's meaning.</b> - One proper criterion for determining the meaning of a legislative enactment is to consider the general scheme and purport of the proposed legislation.

<p class="p6"><b>Old law, mischief, and remedy considered at arriving at legislative intention.</b> - This section directs that statutes be construed with reference to the intention of the General Assembly, and that the old law, the mischief, and the remedy be considered to arrive at that intention.

<p class="p6">To ascertain the intention of the General Assembly, after examining the words of the Act itself, it is necessary to take into view every fact and circumstance that influenced its passage. The court must consider what the law was before, the mischiefs against which the law did not provide, the nature of the remedy proposed, and the true reason of the remedy. McGuire v.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Larger and more extensive statutory expression controls.</b> - Where a particular expression in one part of a statute is not so extensive or large in its import as other expressions in the same statute, it must yield to the larger and more extensive expression, where the latter embodies the real intent of the General Assembly. Board of Trustees v. Christy, 246 Ga. 553, 272 S.E.2d 288 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>One of two provisos should not be rejected as senseless or superfluous.</b> - The rule of construction that effect is to be given to all the words of a statute forbids that two provisos should be treated as having no more scope or significance than one of them would have if standing alone. It is better to wait for a legislative amendment than to arbitrarily reject one of the provisos as senseless or superfluous. Butterworth v.

<p class="p6"><b>Statutes "in pari materia" construed together.</b> - It is an elementary rule of statutory construction that a statute must be construed in relation to other statutes of which it is a part, and all statutes relating to the same subject matter, briefly called statutes "in pari materia," are construed together and harmonized wherever possible, so as to ascertain the legislative intendment and give effect thereto.

<p class="p6"><b>Except where language clear.</b> - Statutes in pari materia may not be resorted to where language under consideration is clear, but where the terms of the statute to be construed are ambiguous or its significance is of a doubtful character, it becomes necessary to give proper consideration to other related statutes in order to ascertain the legislative intent in reference to the whole system of laws of which the doubtful statute is a part.

<p class="p6"><b>Unclear law construed in light of whole system of laws.</b> - While the Supreme Court recognizes the rule that statutes in pari materia may not be resorted to where the language of the statute under consideration is clear, it is equally as well settled that, where the terms of the statute to be construed are ambiguous or its significance is of a doubtful character, it becomes necessary to give proper consideration to other related statutes in order to ascertain the legislative intent in reference to the whole system of laws of which the doubtful statute is a part.

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>"Accident"</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>"Accident" means unintentional act.</b> - To the average layman, "accident" means only what the definition given it in this section states; an unintentional act, as opposed to something done in order to achieve a particular consequence. Bush v. Skelton, 91 Ga. App. 83, 84 S.E.2d 835 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"Accident" means an unintentional act, as opposed to something done in order to achieve a particular consequence. Cohran v. Douglasville Concrete Prods., Inc., 153 Ga. App. 8, 264 S.E.2d 507 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">For purposes of constructing subject insurance policy, accident meant "an event which takes place without one's foresight or expectation or design." Crook v. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 207 Ga. App. 614, 428 S.E.2d 802 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>"Accident" in its strict sense implies absence of negligence for which no one is liable.</b> Richter v. Atlantic Co., 65 Ga. App. 605, 16 S.E.2d 259 (1941). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The idea of "accident" excludes responsibility because of negligence. Bush v. Skelton, 91 Ga. App. 83, 84 S.E.2d 835 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The legal connotation of "accident" has reference to unintentional acts occurring without being caused by any negligence of the parties involved. Lawrence v. Hayes, 92 Ga. App. 778, 90 S.E.2d 102 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The defense of accident is to be confined to its strict sense as an occurrence which takes place in the absence of negligence and for which no one would be liable. Chadwick v. Miller, 169 Ga. App. 338, 312 S.E.2d 835 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Although the definition of "accident" is somewhat ambiguous, in that it may also be said of lack of ordinary care that does not exist by reason of foresight or design, yet the distinction has been clearly stated in the cases as something which would not have been precluded by the exercise of ordinary care on the part of either the plaintiff or the defendant. Zayre of Ga., Inc. v. Haynes, 134 Ga. App. 15, 213 S.E.2d 163 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Personal injury cases.</b> - Word "accident" means, in personal injury cases, injury which occurs without being caused by negligence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. Cohran v. Douglasville Concrete Prods., Inc., 153 Ga. App. 8, 264 S.E.2d 507 (1980); Freed v. Redwing Refrigeration, Inc., 156 Ga. App. 817, 275 S.E.2d 691 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">An "accident," in a strict legal sense, as applied to negligence cases, refers to an event which is not proximately caused by negligence, but instead arises from an unforeseen or unexplained cause. But it is also often used to indicate a happening which, although not wholly free from negligence by some person, was not proximately caused by the failure of either of the parties to a case to exercise ordinary care in the situation. Baggett v. Jackson, 79 Ga. App. 460, 54 S.E.2d 146 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The word "accident," as applied to personal injury cases, has a legal meaning as referring to an injury which occurs without being caused by the negligence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. Bush v. Skelton, 91 Ga. App. 83, 84 S.E.2d 835 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In a personal injury case, an "accident" is an event which happens unmixed with the lack of ordinary care and diligence of either party, for which there can be no recovery. Trammell v. Williams, 97 Ga. App. 31, 101 S.E.2d 887 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No error in refusing accident charge when evidence plainly shows negligence.</b> - There is no error in a refusal to charge the jury on the law of accident, even upon request, when the evidence plainly shows that the plaintiff's injuries were the result of the defendants' negligence. Lawrence v. Hayes, 92 Ga. App. 778, 90 S.E.2d 102 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Defendant willfully and wantonly fires loaded pistol.</b> - Where the defendant was engaged in the unlawful act of willfully and wantonly firing a loaded pistol between dark and daylight on a public highway, not on the defendant's own premises or in defense of person or property, from which a homicide resulted, the defense of accidental homicide was not involved, and the trial judge did not err in refusing to give a written request to charge. Creel v. State, 216 Ga. 233, 115 S.E.2d 552 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Because the underlying civil action did not involve allegations of an "accident," and there was no "occurrence" under the terms of the insurance policy, the defendant insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify plaintiffs in the underlying action and the insurer was entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' suit. Burt Co. v. Clarendon Nat'l Ins. Co., 385 Fed. Appx. 892 (11th Cir. 2010)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Error to give charge where defense not sustained by evidence.</b> - It is error to give in charge the law of accident where neither the pleadings nor any evidence would sustain this defense. Bush v. Skelton, 91 Ga. App. 83, 84 S.E.2d 835 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Evidence plainly shows negligence.</b> - Where the evidence plainly shows that the injuries of the plaintiff were due either exclusively to the plaintiff's own negligence, or solely to the negligence of the defendant, or to the negligence of both the plaintiff and the defendant, it is error for the court to charge the law of accident. Everett v. Clegg, 213 Ga. 168, 97 S.E.2d 689 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Where no accident, and charge given without defining term, error requires reversal.</b> - Where an accident is not involved in a case, and a charge is given on "accident" without defining the term, which would tend to lead the jury to believe that the plaintiffs could not recover unless the act of the defendant was nonaccidental or intentional, then the charge is an error requiring a reversal of the case. Bush v. Skelton, 91 Ga. App. 83, 84 S.E.2d 835 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Where accident question not raised, injection of theory of accident reversible error.</b> - Where neither the pleadings nor the evidence raised any question of accident, the issue before the jury being whether the injuries of the plaintiff were caused by the negligence of the defendant, or by the plaintiff's own negligence, or by the joint negligence of both, the injection by the court of the theory of accident as a cause of the two vehicles colliding was calculated to detract the attention of the jury from the real issue in the case and was reversible error. Everett v. Clegg, 213 Ga. 168, 97 S.E.2d 689 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>HOA's removal of homeowners' sign presented jury question.</b> - In a dispute involving a homeowners' association's (HOA) claim of a pedestrian easement access across a subdivision lot to a lake, the term "10' PEDESTRIAN ESMT" on the plat was void for uncertainty of description. The lot owners' counterclaims for trespass, theft by taking (for removal of a sign), interfering with the right of quiet enjoyment, attorney's fees, and punitive damages presented jury questions; however, their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was subject to summary judgment.

<p class="p6">Loss of consciousness by a driver would not be a complete defense if by the exercise of ordinary care it was foreseeable to the driver that the driver might lose consciousness while driving; even if loss of consciousness was not foreseeable, it would still not be a complete defense if the evidence showed the loss of consciousness occurred, not suddenly, but in a manner that would have allowed a reasonable driver to take some action to avoid the ensuing accident.

<p class="p6"><b>Popular meanings of "sickness" and "disease."</b> - The words "sickness" and "disease" are technically synonymous, but when given the popular meaning, as required in construing a contract of insurance, "sickness" is a condition interfering with one's usual activities, whereas "disease" may exist without such result.

<p class="p6"><b>Ignorance of law no excuse for granting relief against consequences of voluntary actions.</b> - Mere ignorance of law on the part of one who, with full knowledge of all the facts, voluntarily takes steps with regard thereto which operates to one's prejudice, affords no ground for granting one relief against the consequences of one's own folly, though one may in good faith have labored under a misapprehension as to the legal effect of the course one elected to pursue.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Nature of comity.</b> - Comity is reciprocity. It cannot be that the laws of the several states of the union differ so materially in policy or in the nature of their institutions as to require that unquestionable defensive right of every sovereignty, that of protecting its citizens against the operation of the laws or doctrines of another state, incompatible with their safety, or injurious to their interest. Jackson v. Johnson, 34 Ga. 511, 89 Am. Dec. 263 (1866).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Comity requires that state courts be afforded opportunity to perform duties.</b> - Although the states are sovereign entities, they are bound along with their officials, including their judges, by the United States Constitution and the federal statutory law. Principles of comity in the United States federal system require that the state courts be afforded the opportunity to perform their duty, which includes responding to attacks on state authority based on the federal law, or, if the litigation is wholly private, construing and applying the applicable federal requirements. Webb v. Webb, 451 U.S. 493, 101 S. Ct. 1889, 68 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Public policy controlled over contract terms.</b> - In answering a question certified from a federal appeals court in an action concerning a noncompetition agreement, the Georgia Supreme Court held that, based on O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 1-3-9, the law of the jurisdiction chosen by the parties to a contract to govern their contractual rights would not be applied by Georgia courts where application of the chosen law would contravene the policy of, or would be prejudicial to the interests of Georgia, and that covenants against disclosure and competition affected the interests of Georgia, namely the flow of information needed for competition among businesses, and hence their validity would be determined by the public policy of Georgia.

<p class="p8"><br>

<p class="p6"><b>In enforcing comity, Georgia does so where not contrary to state policy.</b> - In enforcing comity in respect to the laws of sister states, Georgia does so only so long as its enforcement is not contrary to the policy of this state.

<p class="p6"><b>State courts will not exclude Alabama suitors where Alabama courts do not exclude Georgia suitors.</b> - Only in this sense is the expression "reciprocity is comity" applicable to causes of action springing from wrongful deaths occurring in Alabama.

<p class="p6"><b>If foreign appointed administrator becomes state resident, liable to be sued here.</b> - If an administrator appointed in Alabama, together with the securities on the administrator's bond, become residents of this state, they are liable to be sued here on a decree rendered in this state on a bill filed by the distributees for an account and settlement. Johnson v. Jackson, 56 Ga. 326, 21 Am. R. 285 (1876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When receiver may sue in foreign jurisdiction.</b> - While a chancery or statutory receiver cannot sue in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction by virtue of the receiver appointment alone, the receiver can do so when the receiver is expressly authorized by statute to sue, or when the receiver is expressly or by necessary implication vested with title, or when the receiver is made a quasi-assignee or representative of creditors. Bullock v. Oliver, 155 Ga. 151, 116 S.E. 293, 29 A.L.R. 1484, answer conformed to, 30 Ga. App. 91, 117 S.E. 112 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Georgia must give full faith and credit to sister state's judgment.</b> - Even if the statutory law of this state is different from that of a sister state, and even if this would prevent recovery, the forum state (Georgia) must give full faith and credit to a judgment rendered by the sister state.

Clark v. Turner, 73 Ga. 1 (1884).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Georgia courts recognize and prospectively enforce foreign alimony or child support decree.</b> - Although a foreign decree may be nonfinal because it can be prospectively modified, for reasons of comity Georgia courts will recognize and give prospective enforcement to a foreign alimony or child support decree by establishing it as the decree of a Georgia court through domestication and treating it as though it were a local decree. Williamson v. Williamson, 247 Ga. 260, 275 S.E.2d 42, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 669, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Tillman v. Gibson, 44 Ga. App. 440, 161 S.E. 630 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The conflicts rule in this state is that where a contract is made and is to be performed in another state, the laws of the latter state will govern as to the validity, nature, obligation, and construction of the contract, where they are duly pleaded and proved, and such laws will be enforced by comity in this state unless they are contrary to public policy or prejudicial to the interests of this state. Rohner, Gehrig &amp; Co. v. Capital City Bank, 655 F.2d 571 (5th Cir. 1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Foreign contract and laws enforced in this state.</b> - Whenever a contract made in a place outside of the territorial jurisdiction of this state is sought to be enforced in this state, courts here will enforce the contract and give effect to the laws of the place in which it was executed, so far as that can be done without violating the law of this state or its established policy. Massachusetts Benefit Life Ass'n v. Robinson, 104 Ga. 256, 30 S.E. 918, 42 L.R.A. 261 (1898). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Application in tort cases of lex loci delicto commissi.</b> - A state court ought to apply the substantive law of the state or county in which the tort occurred under the lex loci delicto commissi doctrine. However, if the application of foreign law would prove insurmountably difficult, state substantive law may govern given both parties' concurrence. Lavine v. General Mills, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 332 (N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Lex loci governs as to the nature, construction and obligation of contracts.</b> Missouri State Life Ins. Co. v. Lovelace, 1 Ga. App. 446, 58 S.E. 93 (1907). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The conflicts rule in this state is that where a contract is made and is to be performed in another state, the laws of the latter state will govern as to the validity, nature, obligation, and construction of the contract, where they are duly pleaded and proved, and such laws will be enforced by comity in this state unless they are contrary to public policy or prejudicial to the interests of this state. Rohner, Gehrig &amp; Co. v. Capital City Bank, 655 F.2d 571 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Law of the place where contract is made is prima facie that which parties intended</b> and that such law ought, therefore, to prevail. King v. King, 218 Ga. 534, 129 S.E.2d 147 (1962), appeal dismissed, 375 U.S. 17, 84 S. Ct. 101, 11 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Lex loci not enforced where contrary to morals, general policy, or conscience.</b> - While the lex loci, as a general rule, governs the construction of contracts, it is subject, in practice, to the great controlling idea that they will not be enforced, by comity, if they involve anything immoral, contrary to general policy, or violative of the conscience of the state called on to give them effect. Eubanks v. Banks, 34 Ga. 407 (1866).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Local law, not lex loci, applicable to remedy on contracts.</b> - As a general principle, the lex loci applies only to the interpretation of contracts, and the remedy on them must be prosecuted according to the laws of the country in which the action is brought. Davis v. DeVaughn, 7 Ga. App. 324, 66 S.E. 956 (1910); Chamblee v. Colt Co., 31 Ga. App. 34, 119 S.E. 438 (1923). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Local limitation laws applicable.</b> - Where a suit upon a written contract executed and to be performed in another state is brought in a court of this state, the question whether or not the plaintiff's right of action is barred, being one relating exclusively to the remedy, must be determined with reference to the limitation laws of Georgia. Obear v. First Nat'l Bank, 97 Ga. 587, 25 S.E. 335, 33 L.R.A. 384 (1895). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">While the validity and form of a contract executed and to be performed in another state must be determined by the laws of that state, yet when suit is brought thereon in a Georgia court, the limitation statutes of Georgia must be applied. Gaffe v. Williams, 194 Ga. 673, 22 S.E.2d 512, answer conformed to, 68 Ga. App. 299, 22 S.E.2d 765 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Where parties contemplate another place of performance, latter laws preferred.</b> - The place where the contract is entered into is not to be exclusively considered, if the parties had in contemplation another place at the time of the contract, the laws of the latter will be preferred in the construction of the contract. Dunn v. Welsh, 62 Ga. 241 (1879). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Contracts are to be governed as to their nature, validity, and interpretation by the law of the place where they were made, except where it appears from the contract that it is to be performed in a state other than that in which it was made, in which case the laws of that sister state will be applied in the enforcement of any contract to be there performed, so long as such laws do not conflict with the statute, powers, or rights of the state wherein it was executed and sought to be enforced. Tillman v. Gibson, 44 Ga. App. 440, 161 S.E. 630 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Contract's construction governed by lex loci, unless intended to have effect within Georgia.</b> - The construction of a contract is to be governed by the law of the place of its making, unless it shall appear that the writing or contract is intended to have effect principally within the State of Georgia. Old Hickory Prods. Co. v. Hickory Specialties, Inc., 366 F. Supp. 913 (N.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Existing laws part of contract.</b> - The laws which exist at the time and place of the making of a contract enter into and form a part of it. West End &amp; A. St. R.R. v. Atlanta St. R.R., 49 Ga. 151 (1873).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Courts presume common law in force in foreign state.</b> - In the absence of allegations as to what the law of a foreign state is, our courts will presume that the common law is of force in that state.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Common law determined by looking at Georgia case law.</b> - Georgia courts then go through a two-step process: (1) in the absence of pleading and proof of foreign law, the courts presume that the common law is in effect in the foreign state; and (2) in determining what this "presumed" common law is, the Georgia courts, rather than looking to the foreign case law, look to Georgia case law. Budget Rent-A-Car Corp. v. Fein, 342 F.2d 509 (5th Cir. 1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Local case law consulted to interpret foreign statute where no applicable statute.</b> - The case law of the locus will be consulted only when it is interpretive of a foreign statute and where there is no applicable foreign statute.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Foreign contract occupies foreign legal status, but foreign law must be put in evidence.</b> - A contract made and to be performed in another state will be enforced by the courts of this state according to the legal status it would occupy in that state. But the law of that state must be put in evidence before it can be applied in this state. Champion v. Wilson &amp; Co., 64 Ga. 184 (1879).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Note made upon Sunday not enforced.</b> - As the laws of this state formerly forbid any transaction of any business, trade, or calling on Sunday, a note made upon that day, in pursuance of trade or business, will not be enforced by the courts of this state under the laws of this state, as such a contract is void.

<p class="p6"><b>Shipping contract's validity, form, and effect determined by state where made and performed.</b> - If goods are shipped in one state on a through contract, to be transported by a common carrier and delivered in another (omitting any question of public policy), the general rule is, in the absence of anything to show a contrary intent, the validity, form, and effect of the contract will be determined by the laws of the state where the contract was made and partly to be performed. Southern Express Co. v. Hanaw, 134 Ga. 445, 67 S.E. 944, 137 Am. St. R. 227 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Validity and effect of foreign, oral child custody contract determined by foreign law.</b> - Where the defendants in a habeas corpus proceeding relied on an oral contract as and for their right to have and retain custody and care of a child, which contract was made with the plaintiffs while all of them resided in another state, the validity and effect of the contract must be determined by the laws of that state, especially since the parties did not contemplate performance of the contract elsewhere.

</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Georgia courts refuse to recognize or enforce any gambling or wagering contract.</b> - Georgia courts regard statutes declaring gambling contracts and transactions illegal or void as embodying a distinctive public policy which requires the courts of this state to refuse to recognize or enforce any contract or transaction in violation of their terms, even though such contract or transaction may have had its situs outside the Georgia forum, by the laws of which situs it is valid, and therefore does not come within the direct operation of the Georgia statutes. The practical result of this view is that a gambling or wagering contract, in order to be upheld or enforced, must be valid both by its proper law - that is, by the law of its situs - and by the law of Georgia. Gulf Collateral, Inc. v. Morgan, 415 F. Supp. 319 (S.D. Ga. 1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>Manner of determining materiality of representations in insurance contract controlled by lex fori.</b> - The materiality of representations made by the insured in the insured's application, under the laws of Georgia, is a question for the jury to decide. The manner in which this question shall be determined, being a matter affecting the remedy only, and not the validity, form, or effect of the contract, is to be controlled by the lex fori, and not by the lex loci contractus. Massachusetts Benefit Life Ass'n v. Robinson, 104 Ga. 256, 30 S.E. 918, 42 L.R.A. 261 (1898).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Georgia's Confederate heritage, physical artifacts and battle sites, and historic events and persons not only attract visitors, they are potentially of even greater importance and benefit to our state's economy. Increased development of our state's Confederate history and heritage as part of the tourism industry will be enhanced through recognizing, celebrating, and advertising that heritage and history. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The month of April of each year is hereby designated as Confederate History and Heritage Month and shall be set aside to honor, observe, and celebrate the Confederate States of America, its history, those who served in its armed forces and government, and all those millions of its citizens of various races and ethnic groups and religions who contributed in sundry and myriad ways to the cause which they held so dear from its founding on February 4, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama, until the Confederate ship CSS <i>Shenandoah </i>sailed into Liverpool Harbor and surrendered to British authorities on November 6, 1865. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Officials and departments of state, county, and municipal governments, boards of education, elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, businesses, and all citizens are encouraged to participate in programs, displays, and activities that commemorate and honor our shared history and cultural inheritance throughout each April during Confederate History and Heritage Month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6">"(1) The Georgia Water Quality Control Act was passed by the Georgia General Assembly and signed into law in 1964 by Governor Carl Sanders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(2)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time, there were 25 communities in Georgia which had no public sewer systems, 40 communities with a sewer system but no treatment facilities, 60 communities with a sewer system but only primary treatment facilities, 50 communities with a sewer system and secondary treatment facilities which were in need of improvement, and 395 industries which had documented untreated or inadequately treated discharges to Georgia's surface waters; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(3)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time of passage of the Act, many of Georgia's surface waters were extremely polluted, and serious water quality problems existed all over the State of Georgia; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(4)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The state established the Georgia Water Quality Control Board (later reconstituted as the Georgia Environmental Protection Division as a result of the 1972 Reorganization of State Government under Governor Jimmy Carter), and Governor Sanders appointed R.S. 'Rock' Howard to be the board's executive secretary; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(5) By the time the Federal Water Quality Control Act was passed in 1972, most of Georgia's industries had been brought into compliance with the initial requirements of the federal Act; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(6) Over the ensuing four decades, billions of federal, state, and local dollars have been invested in planning, designing, and constructing modern publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities throughout this state; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(7)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Georgia's water professionals are committed to operating these facilities to maintain consistent compliance with extremely stringent standards; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(8)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both publicly and privately owned facilities have performed so well that they are no longer the most significant threat to Georgia's waters; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(9)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The quality of Georgia's waters has improved dramatically throughout this great state over the years since the passage of the original Act; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(10)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is imperative that these improvements be sustained while continuing our efforts to educate Georgians of their growing responsibility in the reduction of non-point sources of pollution to Georgia's waters; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">"(11)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The success that we have experienced thus far and the success that we will have is due to the tremendous dedication and efforts of Georgia's water professionals; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
