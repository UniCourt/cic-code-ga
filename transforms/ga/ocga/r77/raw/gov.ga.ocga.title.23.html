<p class="p4"><b>In an equitable proceeding, it is the general rule</b> that all persons having a legal or equitable interest in the subject matter of the suit must be made parties; and no court should undertake to reform a written instrument in an essential matter, without having before it all the parties to be affected by the proposed reformation.

<p class="p4"><b>Universal test of the jurisdiction of a court to issue injunctions</b> is the absence of a legal remedy by which the complainant might obtain the full relief to which the facts and circumstances entitle the complainant, and this is likewise the test of its power to restrain breaches of a contract. Ford v. Finney, 35 Ga. 258 (1866); Chadwick v. Dolinoff, 207 Ga. 702, 64 S.E.2d 76 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity will grant relief only when there is no available and adequate and complete remedy at law.</b> Colston v. Hutchinson, 208 Ga. 559, 67 S.E.2d 763 (1951); Cantrell v. Henry County, 250 Ga. 822, 301 S.E.2d 870 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a breach of contract action between an insurer and an agency, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in granting an interlocutory injunction to the agency as, after a balancing of the equities in the agency's favor, the record supported the finding that the insurer conducted itself, to the agency's detriment, as though arbitration of the dispute had been completed and it had been absolved from complying with its post-termination obligations under the underlying agency agreement between the parties. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stephen Brown Ins. Agency, Inc., 290 Ga. App. 660, 660 S.E.2d 445 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1321, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 687 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When all relief sought can be obtained in the manner provided for by law, it is error for equity to intervene.</b> Waller v. Conner, 218 Ga. 633, 129 S.E.2d 845 (1963); Thomason v. Harper Motor Lines, 225 Ga. 312, 168 S.E.2d 147 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity by writ of injunction will restrain any act which is illegal or contrary to equity and good conscience and for which no adequate remedy at law is provided. But when all the relief sought can be obtained in the manner provided by law, a suit in equity for injunction will not lie. Lanier v. Suttles, 212 Ga. 154, 91 S.E.2d 21 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Injunction does not lie when the complaining party has a plain and adequate remedy at law which is practical and efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as the remedy in equity. Thomason v. Harper Motor Lines, 225 Ga. 312, 168 S.E.2d 147 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since equity jurisdiction is for the relief of parties when the general rules of law would be deficient in protecting from anticipated wrong or affording relief for injuries done, there is no sound reason in law or equity why equity should not take jurisdiction and grant relief from a void marriage complained of that will be both adequate and complete. Gearllach v. Odom, 200 Ga. 350, 37 S.E.2d 184 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When no legal reason appears from the allegations of the petition why the plaintiff, without seeking an injunction, is not possessed of an adequate and complete remedy at law; in the absence of such indispensable averments, the petition fails to state a proper cause for the extraordinary equitable remedy of injunction. Chadwick v. Dolinoff, 207 Ga. 702, 64 S.E.2d 76 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equitable relief is inappropriate when an adequate and complete remedy at law in the form of an action in implied assumpsit or quasi-contract was and is available against a party, the record and the order of the trial court suggest that a money judgment against the party would provide complete relief with respect to the party, and the record fails to disclose affirmatively that such a remedy would not be adequate. Cantrell v. Henry County, 250 Ga. 822, 301 S.E.2d 870 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When a statutory remedy by appeal has failed to eliminate the law violation or gross abuse of discretion which is its equivalent, equity will grant relief.</b> Carter v. Board of Educ., 221 Ga. 775, 147 S.E.2d 315 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, upon the death of the grantee in a deed executed by a married woman, a receiver is appointed for the property belonging to his estate, and the grantor in such a deed intervenes in the equitable proceeding for the purpose of asserting her right to recover the property so conveyed to the decedent, and mesne profits thereon, upon the ground that the conveyance was made in satisfaction of the debt of her husband, the proceeding is one in equity and is governed by equitable principles. In such a case the intervenor cannot recover against the assets in the hands of the receiver for administration in equity, without accounting for such portion of the consideration for her deed as was represented by her own obligation. Turner v. Warren, 193 Ga. 455, 18 S.E.2d 865 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts exercising equitable jurisdiction will not enjoin prosecutions under municipal ordinances,</b> even when the ordinances are allegedly invalid and there are threats of arrest and multiplicity of prosecutions, unless it is shown that the threatened prosecutions are for the sole purpose of unlawfully taking or destroying property or the business of the plaintiff, or that they will in fact result in irreparable injury thereto, and unless the complaining party has no plain and adequate remedy at law which is as practical and efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as its remedy in equity. Arnold v. Mathews, 226 Ga. 809, 177 S.E.2d 691 (1970). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statement that decisions of the boards of education will not be interfered with by courts of equity unless they amount to a violation of law or are a gross abuse of discretion must be read and considered along with the rule of law that remedies at law, if adequate, must be exhausted before resort to equity will be allowed; when thus construed they mean simply that, when the remedy by appeal has failed to eliminate the law violation or gross abuse of discretion which is its equivalent, equity will grant relief or, as is permissible in all cases to prevent irreparable injury, or when equity alone can grant adequate relief, exhaustion of the statutory remedy of appeal is not a prerequisite to relief in equity. Bedingfield v. Parkerson, 212 Ga. 654, 94 S.E.2d 714 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When it is necessary to prevent irreparable injury or when equity alone can grant adequate relief, exhaustion of a statutory remedy of appeal is not a prerequisite to relief in equity. Carter v. Board of Educ., 221 Ga. 775, 147 S.E.2d 315 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A court of equity should not exercise the court's extraordinary powers when there is no grave danger of impending injury;</b> bare fears of injury will not authorize such action. McPhaul v. Simon, 181 Ga. 260, 182 S.E. 19 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that repeated arrests and prosecutions may be instituted under an invalid ordinance will not, without more, justify equitable interference.</b> Jewel Tea Co. v. City of Cartersville, 185 Ga. 799, 196 S.E. 712 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The fact that a prosecution may be based on an invalid ordinance does not, in the absence of other circumstances, justify intervention of equity changing the general rule. Spur Distrib. Co. v. Mayor of Americus, 190 Ga. 842, 11 S.E.2d 30 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere inconvenience and expense and apprehension of injury to property rights will not give equity jurisdiction;</b> neither will mere general allegations of irreparable injury and deprivation of property rights. Spur Distrib. Co. v. Mayor of Americus, 190 Ga. 842, 11 S.E.2d 30 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere financial inability to furnish the bond required affords no lawful basis for equitable interference.</b> Grimmett v. Barnwell, 184 Ga. 461, 192 S.E. 191 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>As a general rule, equity will not decree specific performance of contracts relating to personal property.</b> Black v. American Vending Co., 239 Ga. 632, 238 S.E.2d 420 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Only under exceptional facts and circumstances may equity powers be used to restrain criminal prosecutions,</b> even though their defense may be burdensome and attended by inconvenience. Spur Distrib. Co. v. Mayor of Americus, 190 Ga. 842, 11 S.E.2d 30 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When a petitioner seeking an equitable decree annulling a bigamous marriage</b> asserts that he did not know at the time of the ceremony that the defendant was a married woman; he does not come into court with unclean hands barring him from equitable relief. Gearllach v. Odom, 200 Ga. 350, 37 S.E.2d 184 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Although it is uncertain that there can be a successfully-maintained proceeding in equity to annul a marriage that, as a matter of law, is null and void already,</b> the designation of the petition as one for annulment is no reason why a decree as prayed, declaring the marriage void, should not be granted, since such a decree is essential to the full protection of the petitioner from injury that is and well may be anticipated as a result of a void marriage ceremony.

<p class="p4"><b>Minor children may bring wrongful death action.</b> - After a surviving spouse abandoned the minor children and could not be found, the factual circumstances demand the exercise of the court's equitable powers to preserve the rights of the minor children. The trial court should have allowed these minors, who have no remedy at law, to maintain an action for the wrongful death of their mother. Brown v. Liberty Oil &amp; Ref.

<p class="p4"><b>When equity will enjoin foreclosure.</b> - When one borrows a sum of money and executes a deed to an undivided interest in certain realty to secure the repayment of the loan, the lender has a right to foreclose upon and sell the undivided interest; and a court of equity will not, unless under peculiar circumstances, enjoin one against enforcement of the security deed, so as to allow the debtor time to have the property partitioned.

<p class="p4"><b>Application of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 23-1-3 to the successor liability doctrine.</b> - Corporate debtor that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy was not liable to an LLC for unpaid rent that was owed by a lock and key company, even though the same individual owned both companies and the debtor had accepted collateral the lock and key company owned in full satisfaction of debt the company owed. The debtor's decision to accept collateral the lock and key company owned in full satisfaction of the company's debt was permitted under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-9-620 and was not a fraudulent attempt to avoid liabilities the lock and key company owed, the debtor was not a "mere continuation" of the lock and key company, and a contrary conclusion would have elevated form over substance and abridged the equitable principles that were codified in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-3.

<p class="p4"><b>Restraint of criminal prosecution.</b> - Allegations of petition by filling station operators asking protection from the effect of a city ordinance requiring payment by certain operators for a business license, in addition to the regular business license required of all gasoline filling stations, when the city marshal had made and was threatening to make cases against the petitioners for violation of the ordinance, the city was threatening to issue executions against plaintiff's property for the penalties in the ordinance, and there was no charter provision for the filing of affidavits of illegality, did not make out such a case as would take it out of the general rule that equitable powers may not be used to restrain criminal prosecution in enforcement of a municipal ordinance alleged to be invalid.

<p class="p4"><b>Adequate remedy at law.</b> - Superior court erred in granting an aunt and uncle custody of minor children because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petition for custody since a probate court had exclusive jurisdiction to issue and revoke letters of testamentary guardianship, and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-4(b) mandated the issuance of letters of testamentary guardianship to the brother of the children's father without notice and a hearing and without consideration of the children's best interests; equity afforded no valid basis for the superior court's exercise of jurisdiction because the aunt and uncle had an appropriate remedy in the probate court to challenge the testamentary guardianship: a petition for revocation or suspension of the brother's letters of testamentary guardianship.

Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-14(b)(6), a petition for such an appointment had to set forth that no other person appeared to have authority to act, whereas the attorney-in-fact's position was that the attorney-in-fact did have the authority to act.

<p class="p4"><b>It will be readily seen from this section that, if the law itself provides a full and adequate remedy,</b> ordinarily that is the end of the matter, and equity will not interfere.

<p class="p4"><b>Equity grants no relief to one who has an adequate remedy at law.</b> Goodman v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 221 Ga. 396, 144 S.E.2d 764 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When private property is actually about to be confiscated by the enforcement of an assessment for a local improvement, the remedy of affidavit of illegality as provided in the city charter is not as complete or effectual as equitable relief; in such a case an injunction may be granted. Holst v. City of La Grange, 175 Ga. 402, 165 S.E. 217 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A mere privilege to a party to sue at law, or the existence of a common-law remedy not as complete or effectual as the equitable relief, does not deprive equity of jurisdiction. Quitman Cooperage Co. v. People's First Nat'l Bank, 178 Ga. 90, 172 S.E. 17 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A money judgment having been rendered in a trover suit pending bankruptcy proceedings voluntarily instituted by the defendant therein, the petition brought by the defendant to enjoin garnishment proceedings based on the trover judgment on the ground that the debt had been subsequently discharged by the order of the bankruptcy court, should have been dismissed on general demurrer (now motion to dismiss); because, if the debt was discharged, the defendant could have been fully protected by setting up this defense in the court where the garnishment case was pending and where he had an adequate and complete remedy at law, in which event a court of equity will not grant relief; and because a judgment for the plaintiff in an action of trover, although rendered for a sum of money and not for the property in controversy, constitutes an adjudication of the plaintiff's title to the property, and the debt thus created is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Nash Loan Co. v. Yonge, 182 Ga. 672, 186 S.E. 811 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a defendant has been served and a judgment is rendered against the defendant by fraud, accident, or mistake, without fault or negligence on the defendant's part, a petition in equity to set aside the judgment will lie. Dollar v. Fred W. Amend Co., 184 Ga. 432, 191 S.E.2d 696 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If for any special reason the remedy by attachment against a nonresident debtor in an ordinary claim ex contractu or ex delicto is unavailable or inadequate, equity will lend its aid; but, when in such an ordinary claim the remedy by attachment is available and affords adequate relief, and when the facts alleged fail to invoke any other recognized principle authorizing equitable relief, a court of equity will refuse to assume jurisdiction. Grimmett v. Barnwell, 184 Ga. 461, 192 S.E. 191 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Petition to have defendant enjoined from interfering with plaintiffs in possession of disputed part of land, possession and control of which was alleged to be in defendant, showed no ground for equitable relief, and the existence of an adequate remedy at law because a court of equity will not ordinarily entertain a bill solely for the purpose of establishing the title of a party to real estate, or for the recovery of possession thereof, as these objects can generally be accomplished by an action of ejectment at law. Slaughter v. Land, 190 Ga. 491, 9 S.E.2d 754 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the plaintiff contends all partnership relations between the plaintiff and the defendant have come to an end, that a balance has been struck, and that an indebtedness is allegedly due by the defendant to the plaintiff, which cannot be affected by any transactions between the partnership and its creditors or debtors, this is not an equitable action by a member of a firm against one's copartner, but an action of law, one man against another who has formerly been one's partner, upon an indebtedness a part of which grew out of the formerly existing partnership between them. Manry v. Hendricks, 192 Ga. 319, 15 S.E.2d 434 (1941). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the partnership has been fully dissolved by written contract and the rights of each party definitely established, in case of a breach of such contract equity will not order an accounting as the remedy is at law. Manry v. Hendricks, 192 Ga. 319, 15 S.E.2d 434 (1941). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even if in any case equity can remove an executor, when there were no allegations in petition seeking inter alia removal of an executor for fraud and conspiracy tending to show why complainants could not by pursuing the remedy provided by law before the court of ordinary (now probate court), obtain relief as complete and effectual as in a court of equity, under the principle codified in this section, equity would not assume jurisdiction. Georgia Baptist Orphans Home v. Weaver, 193 Ga. 669, 19 S.E.2d 272 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When plaintiff alleges that the plaintiff provided certain labor and materials used in the construction of an apartment house under a contract with the subcontractor of the general contractor, for which the plaintiff has not been paid, and alleges no reason why the plaintiff's remedy at law, suit on the contract, would not be adequate, full, and complete, nor does the plaintiff allege that the subcontractor is insolvent or unable in any way to respond in damages, or is a nonresident of the state, the trial court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Maggi v. Sylvan Circle Apts., Inc., 207 Ga. 580, 63 S.E.2d 368 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the petitioner sought to have an ordinance declared void, and the prosecutions enjoined, and by an amendment to the charter disputed tax executions may be contested by affidavit of illegality, this adequate and complete remedy at law to contest the validity of the ordinance being available, the intervention of equity would not be authorized. City of Eatonton v. Peck, 207 Ga. 705, 64 S.E.2d 61 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A bare threat of injury to property, which, if followed up by an overt act would work irreparable injury, affords no basis for equitable relief by injunction or otherwise. Nottingham v. Elliott, 209 Ga. 481, 74 S.E.2d 93 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity grants no relief to one who has an adequate and complete remedy at law for the redress of an actionable wrong. Mayor of Carrollton v. Chambers, 215 Ga. 193, 109 S.E.2d 755 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since the plaintiff had an adequate and complete remedy at law by affidavit of illegality, an affidavit of illegality, and not a petition for injunction, was the procedure which the plaintiff should have employed to test the validity of property tax assessments. Mayor of Carrollton v. Chambers, 215 Ga. 193, 109 S.E.2d 755 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Insolvency of a subcontractor and inability to respond to such damages as the contractor might recover for breach of the contract is ground for equitable intervention. By bringing in the surety whose principal was insolvent the contractor would be able to obtain full relief, but the contractor's legal remedy would not be complete or as effective and efficient to the ends of justice as that which could be afforded by a court of equity. Concrete Coring Contractors v. Mechanical Contractors &amp; Eng'rs, 220 Ga. 714, 141 S.E.2d 439 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the absence of statutory authority, equity will not intervene when a party has a complete and adequate remedy at law and no other equitable reasons, such as avoidance of a multiplicity of suits or that the acts of the defendant complained of constitute a constantly recurring wrong, generally denominated a continuing wrong, are alleged. Womble v. State Bd. of Exmrs., 221 Ga. 457, 145 S.E.2d 485 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an adequate remedy at law exists, equity is without jurisdiction of the case. Y. v. S., 224 Ga. 352, 162 S.E.2d 321 (1968). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equitable relief is improper if the complainant has a remedy at law which is "adequate," i.e., as practical and as efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as the remedy in equity. Sherrer v. Hale, 248 Ga. 793, 285 S.E.2d 714 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity will grant relief only when there is no available adequate and complete remedy at law. Cantrell v. Henry County, 250 Ga. 822, 301 S.E.2d 870 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equitable relief is inappropriate when an adequate and complete remedy at law in the form of an action in implied assumpsit or quasi-contract was and is available against a party, the record and the order of the trial court suggest that a money judgment against the party would provide complete relief with respect to that party, and the record fails to disclose affirmatively that such a remedy would not be adequate. Cantrell v. Henry County, 250 Ga. 822, 301 S.E.2d 870 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When subsequent to the court's order of payment of a sum of money into the court registry, the jury awarded a judgment in that amount to the plaintiff, as the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, the equitable relief granted by the trial court was inappropriate. Prosser v. Hancock Bus Sales, Inc., 256 Ga. 399, 349 S.E.2d 460 (1986). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a breach of contract action between an insurer and an agency, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in granting an interlocutory injunction to the agency as, after a balancing of the equities in the agency's favor, the record supported the finding that the insurer conducted itself, to the agency's detriment, as though arbitration of the dispute had been completed and it had been absolved from complying with its post-termination obligations under the underlying agency agreement between the parties. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stephen Brown Ins. Agency, Inc., 290 Ga. App. 660, 660 S.E.2d 445 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1321, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 687 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Injunction requiring a bank to pay certain funds into a trial court's registry was inappropriate because a lender had an adequate remedy at law since it could obtain a judgment to completely compensate it for any loss from the bank's removal of funds from a debtor's account. Century Bank of Ga. v. Bank of Am., N.A., 286 Ga. 72, 685 S.E.2d 82 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An employer whose employee had opened a competing business and taken the employer's trade secrets and confidential information had an adequate and complete remedy at law because it could recover money damages from the employee if the employee removed funds from the employee's competing business that rightfully belonged to the employer. Therefore, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 9-5-6 and 23-1-4, a trial court erred in requiring the employee to deposit the business's funds into the registry of the court. Coleman v.

<p class="p4"><b>A remedy at law, to exclude appropriate relief in equity, must be complete and the substantial equivalent of the equitable relief.</b> - It is not enough that there is a remedy at law.

<p class="p4">In a case arising from a mortgage fraud scheme, the government unsuccessfully argued that a title insurance company was not entitled to a constructive trust because it had an adequate remedy at law based on the Attorney General's authority, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 853(i)(1), to remit a forfeiture in the interest of justice. Not only was the <span class="s1">§</span> 853(i)(1) remission a non-judicial remedy left entirely to the discretion of the Attorney General, but under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-4, equitable remedies, such as constructive trusts, were not precluded by the existence of an alternate remedy that was not as complete or effectual as the equitable relief.

<p class="p4"><b>Time limit on filing suit challenging zoning ordinance.</b> - Not only is application for rezoning a prerequisite to filing suit in equity seeking declaration that zoning ordinance is unconstitutional, but, after application for rezoning is denied by governing authority, any suit in equity attacking zoning ordinance as applied to property involved is time barred when no suit challenging zoning classification is filed within 30 days of that decision.

<p class="p4"><b>When law and equity have concurrent jurisdiction, the court first taking will retain it,</b> unless a good reason can be given for the interference of equity. Duke v.

<p class="p4"><b>A court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the judge of probate court over the settlement of accounts of administrators and executors;</b> and the court first taking jurisdiction will retain it. Terry v. Chandler, 172 Ga. 715, 158 S.E. 572 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a habeas corpus proceeding is filed in the court of ordinary (now probate court), involving custody of a minor child, and subsequently a petition is filed involving divorce, alimony, and the custody of such child, equity has power to enjoin the habeas corpus proceeding and determine all the issues in one action. Duke v. Duke, 181 Ga. 21, 181 S.E. 161 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since equity has concurrent jurisdiction with courts of ordinary (now probate courts) in the administration of estates, when its interference is necessary for the full protection of the rights of parties at interest and since it is a recognized rule that, when the heirs at law get together and agree to divide the estate and appoint an agent and put the agent in possession of the property for that purpose, a bill may be filed against the agent by any one or more of the distributees, the same as against an administrator, it cannot be said that, a petition seeking an order restraining the heir's agent from the alleged fraudulent acts, and a receivership under direction of the court of equity was devoid of equity. Shingler v. Shingler, 184 Ga. 671, 192 S.E. 824 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the ordinary (now judge of probate court) and the judge of the superior court have equal and concurrent jurisdiction in determining the custody of the children of husband and wife living in a state of separation, only the superior court, so far as habeas corpus proceedings may be resorted to, has jurisdiction of such subject matter when related to a suit for divorce, and superior court judge who, after a habeas corpus proceeding before the ordinary (now judge of probate court) acquires jurisdiction of the subject matter in a divorce proceeding, may properly enjoin further progress of the former proceeding before the ordinary (now judge of probate court), in order that all questions raised by the divorce suit may be considered together. Ponder v. Ponder, 198 Ga. 781, 32 S.E.2d 801 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the ordinary (now judge of probate court) and the judge of the superior court have equal and concurrent jurisdiction in a habeas corpus proceeding between husband and wife involving the custody of their child, it is the general rule that, when two courts have such concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties, the court first taking jurisdiction will retain it unless some good reason be shown for equitable interference. Breeden v. Breeden, 202 Ga. 740, 44 S.E.2d 667 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the superior court acquired jurisdiction of the question of the custody of a child in a divorce case, it retained that jurisdiction for the purpose of rendering a final judgment as to the custody of the child, and when the attempted dismissal by the wife of the proceeding was ineffectual, the ordinary (now judge of probate court) of the county, to whom the wife presented a petition for the writ of habeas corpus, was without jurisdiction to act upon the petition.

<p class="p4">When it appears from a petition praying for an accounting that there was pending in another court a suit by the corporate defendant against the plaintiff, such court being empowered to render an accounting between the parties, and no special reason being set out why a court of equity should assume jurisdiction for such purpose, equity will not enjoin the proceedings and processes of a court of law in the absence of some intervening equity or other proper defense of which the party, without fault on the party's part, cannot avail oneself at law.

<p class="p4"><b>Concurrent jurisdiction no longer existed.</b> - Trial court had jurisdiction to enter an adoption decree that terminated the parental rights of the biological father because the juvenile court proceeding as to the biological father's parental rights had long since ended and, therefore, there was no problem of overlapping jurisdiction or competing, inconsistent rulings.

<p class="p4"><b>Concurrent jurisdiction over counterclaim for accounting of estate.</b> - Because the plaintiffs asserted claims for conversion of property and sought a court order requiring the defendants to turn over certain items of personal property, such claims were properly heard by the superior court, as the court of equity and, accordingly, the superior court properly exercised concurrent jurisdiction over the counterclaim for accounting of an estate.

<p class="p4">Since equity follows the analogy of the law, when fraud is charged, the period of limitations applicable to an action for fraud is the same as that which would apply to an action for the land, that is seven years from the discovery of the fraud. Slade v. Barber, 200 Ga. 405, 37 S.E.2d 143 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When an unmarried man procures a life insurance policy on his own life in which his mother is named beneficiary, and the policy gives the insured the right to change the beneficiary at any time, and subsequently as a consideration for marriage he agrees to substitute his wife as beneficiary in the insurance policy and tells his wife that he has made the change, but later dies without ever having attempted to have the beneficiary changed, the mother is vested with title to the proceeds of the policy upon the death of the insured, and nothing that the insurer can do thereafter can destroy or impair the mother's title thereto; and a court of equity is required, in a contest between the mother and the wife, to award the proceeds of the insurance policy to the mother.

<p class="p4"><b>Power to levy and collect taxes is exclusively a legislative function,</b> and unless authorized by statute, a court of equity is without power to foreclose a lien for taxes and order a sale of the property; no such power having been conferred by statute on a court of equity in this state, the court erred in decreeing that land be sold by the sheriff for payment of state and county taxes.

<p class="p4"><b>Challenge to zoning ordinance treated as appeal or certiorari for time limit purposes.</b> - Although suit in equity to declare zoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied to certain property is not an appeal either in form or in substance, it is nonetheless appropriate to treat it as an appeal or petition for certiorari when considering time constraints on its filing lest requirement of exhaustion be rendered wholly meaningless in that facts have completely changed since rezoning application was denied.

<p class="p4"><b>Equity seeks to do full justice but must do so within the parameters of the law;</b> therefore, a temporary restraining order that acknowledged that students had no legal right to participate in graduation ceremony but ordered that they be allowed to do so anyway, so as to "do the right thing," was in error.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It is one of the maxims of equity that it will not do justice by halves,</b> and what constitutes its chief value is that it can bring before it all parties engaged in a transaction, and however diversified their interests and liabilities may be, it can frame a decree giving each complainant one's right, and holding each defendant to one's proper accountability. Matson v. Crowe, 193 Ga. 578, 19 S.E.2d 288 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Understanding suits in equity.</b> - To preserve a trust estate, to supervise its management, to hold the trustee to the line of duty, for the purpose of preserving its corpus for the benefit of the beneficiaries, is an elementary branch of equity jurisprudence. The judge of the superior court of each county has power, either in term or at chambers, to remove and appoint trustees. When a court of equity obtains jurisdiction for one purpose, it will proceed to give full relief to all parties with reference to the subject matter of the suit, when the court has jurisdiction for that purpose. Fine v. Saul, 183 Ga. 309, 188 S.E. 439 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since equity has concurrent jurisdiction with courts of ordinary (now probate courts) in the administration of estates, when the court's interference is necessary for the full protection of the rights of parties at interest and since it is a recognized rule that, when the heirs at law get together and agree to divide the estate and appoint an agent and put the agent in possession of the property for that purpose, a bill may be filed against the agent by any one or more of the distributees, the same as against an administrator, it cannot be said that a petition seeking an order restraining the heir's agent from the alleged fraudulent acts and a receivership under direction of the court of equity was devoid of equity. Shingler v. Shingler, 184 Ga. 671, 192 S.E. 824 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action in equity, brought against the sole heir at law of a deceased person, to reform a deed executed by a decedent and to recover possession and damages in the nature of mesne profits from a tenant of the heir at law in possession of the property, and to cancel security deeds executed by the heir at law in favor of third persons, the element of the need for reformation of the deed constitutes a common nexus in which all the parties are interested, authorizing the joinder of all interested parties; and since the other relief, both legal and equitable, prayed against the other parties respectively, for recovery of possession and damages for mesne profits and for cancellation of the security deeds, is merely such relief as is needful to make complete the justice to be done by reforming the deed, the action is not multifarious. Mims v. Lifsey, 192 Ga. 366, 15 S.E.2d 440 (1941). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the holder of a deed from a deceased person brings an action in equity against the sole heir at law of the decedent, there being no administration of the decedent's estate, to reform the deed so as to make the description in the deed include lands held adversely by the heir at law and the tenant for years, it is proper to join also as defendants persons to whom the heir at law has executed deeds to secure debt. It is proper in an action to reform an instrument to join as defendants all who are interested adversely to the reformation. Mims v. Lifsey, 192 Ga. 366, 15 S.E.2d 440 (1941). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the complainants under their allegations were entitled in equity to an accounting, and the amount which by the accounting they sought to establish was due them, if at all, as remainder legatees under their mother's will, the right of the executor to sell the property, the right of the petitioners to have a partition, and their right to a judgment against the defendant personally all related to the same thing, to wit, the management by the defendant as trustee and executrix of property disposed of by their mother in her will, and a court of equity would in the same suit undertake to settle the other controversies growing out of the same subject matter, and grant the other relief indicated in the prayers relating to injunction and partition, although these, standing alone, could not be granted. Matson v. Crowe, 193 Ga. 578, 19 S.E.2d 288 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Suits in equity shall be tried in the county where a defendant resides against whom substantial relief is prayed; and one who would have equity must do equity. Hence equity, having the parties before the court rightfully, will proceed to give full relief to all parties in reference to the subject matter provided the court has jurisdiction thereof. Pearson v. George, 211 Ga. 18, 83 S.E.2d 593 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When court has jurisdiction for the purpose of giving injunctive relief against a nuisance, it could under the well-established law of this state retain it as to damages in order to do complete justice between the parties, and upon proper determination of the damages caused by each of the defendants could render judgment against them for their proportionate parts of the damage done.

<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction for final disposition of property.</b> - An equity court, by the continuing receivership, has jurisdiction to make a final disposition of the property according to the respective interests of the parties, and to this end can order a division by sale if necessary.

<p class="p4"><b>As general rule court of equity will not intervene to enjoin collection of tax</b> when no execution has been issued and levied on any of the property of the taxpayer, even though the taxing authorities may have demanded that the taxpayer pay the tax. Warren v. Suttles, 190 Ga. 311, 9 S.E.2d 172 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When plaintiff's petition for injunction against tax collector's interference with a boxing exhibition and collection of tax alleged that the plaintiff had been notified by the tax collector that the plaintiff would not permit the plaintiff to stage the plaintiff's boxing bout if the tax was not paid, that the tax collector would carry out the tax collector's threat if not enjoined, and that such conduct would cause the plaintiff irreparable injury and damage, equity had jurisdiction and authority to grant an injunction under the facts when the petition was presented and sanctioned, and fact that at the time of the hearing part of the relief sought, enjoining the tax collector from closing the plaintiff's boxing exhibition, was no longer appropriate for consideration since the exhibition had been held under the protection of a temporary restraining order should not have prevented the court from retaining jurisdiction of the case for the purpose of determining the legality of the alleged tax and granting a permanent injunction against its collection.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prevention of forfeitures.</b> - Since equity considers that done which ought to be done, it is therefore recognized that in order to prevent forfeitures, which are not favored, equity will lay hold upon any expressed intention of an insured to designate an eligible beneficiary, or any inchoate effort to designate a substituted beneficiary in lieu of a deceased one, when death or illness of the insured prevents the filling of such vacancy. Hewell v. Atlanta Police Relief Ass'n, 184 Ga. 702, 192 S.E. 828 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the plaintiffs are alleged to constitute the sole survivors of the class which could be designated as beneficiaries of the defendant relief association, and for whose benefit the certificate was taken out and maintained, equity in the exercise of its jurisdiction will account that done which ought to have been done if opportunity had been given, and in order to avoid a forfeiture will treat such children, the plaintiffs, as being in good conscience as much as the actual beneficiaries under the certificate as if the insured father had been afforded opportunity to name and had actually named them as such.

<p class="p4"><b>Equity in foreclosure proceedings.</b> - When to a proceeding to foreclose a deed to secure debt as an equitable mortgage, which prays for judgment for principal, interest, and attorney's fees, a debtor files a plea in which it is alleged that the petitioner held as collateral fire insurance policies with a loss-payable clause in favor of the petitioner aggregating more than the amount of the debt, which had become due and payable as the result of a fire some months before there was a default on the debt, and that the insurance could have been collected at any time, but was not collected due solely to the negligence of the petitioner who had made no demand for payment, and that the attorney's fees sought in the foreclosure proceeding would have been unnecessary had such collection been made, such plea alleged facts sufficient to show a breach of duty, both in law and in equity, upon the part of the creditor, which would prevent it from collecting attorney's fees and deny the creditor any relief in equity.

<p class="p4"><b>Equity in political offices.</b> - Even though an appointment may have been made to an office when the term of the incumbent had not expired, and in pursuance of the order of appointment the incumbent had been forcibly removed from the room or quarters of the incumbent's office and thereby deprived of the opportunity of exercising the duties of the office, such incumbent will in equity continue to be treated as the incumbent for the purpose of protecting the incumbent in the incumbent's right to function as such official, pending a judicial determination of the validity of such appointment.

<p class="p4"><b>Equity in giving of security.</b> - The court considers as actually having been performed acts which have been directed or which have agreed or intended to be done. Thus, an agreement to give security may, in a proper case, be deemed to have been executed by the giving of security. United States v. Ferguson, 409 F. Supp. 393 (S.D.

<p class="p4">An oral agreement to adopt may be shown by the acts, conduct, and admissions of the parties, and in order to establish such a contract, the exact word "adopt" need not be used. Toler v. Goodin, 200 Ga. 527, 37 S.E.2d 609 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">An authenticated copy of an application of the parent for a homestead which contained the following question and answer, "If married, of whom does your family consist?" "My wife and adopted daughter and myself," was relevant in an action to prove a virtual adoption as illustrating whether there had been a contract to adopt the child, since it indicates that the child was living with the parents at that time.

<p class="p4">A parol obligation of a person to adopt the child of another as one's own, accompanied by a virtual though not a statutory adoption, and acted upon by all parties concerned for many years and during the obligor's life, may be enforced in equity upon the death of the obligor by decreeing the child entitled as a child to the property of the obligor, undisposed of by will.

<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance properly applied.</b> - Specific performance was the proper remedy since there was no adequate remedy at law given the nature of the stock in the small, family-owned business, and the explicit acknowledgment in the shareholders' buy-sell agreement that specific performance was the appropriate remedy in the event of a breach. Moreover, given the failure of all parties to strictly follow the terms of either the agreement or bylaws, an equitable remedy considered that done which ought to be done. Wallace v. Wallace, 345 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>In pari delicto.</b> - Georgia law follows the well-settled maxim that equity seeks to do equity, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-8, and the equitable doctrine of in pari delicto is based on the principle that to give the plaintiff relief would contravene public morals and impair the good of society; hence, it should not be applied in a case in which to withhold relief would, to a greater extent, offend public morals.

<p class="p4"><b>Unclean hands shown.</b> - In a post-divorce proceeding, a trial court did not err in refusing to hold a mother in contempt and by finding that the father came to court with unclean hands because the evidence showed that the mother did not obtain certain medical evaluations and treatments for the parties' children as previously ordered because the father had not paid child support, had not paid one-half of the medical expenses already incurred for the children, and the children's doctor refused to see the children anymore due to the father's belligerent conduct toward the doctor and staff, thus, the father did have unclean hands for failing to pay the expenses and by the conduct toward the doctor.

<p class="p4">In order to enable plaintiffs to come into equity it is essential in the first instance that they should have paid or tendered the amount admitted to be due.

<p class="p4"><b>Refusal of injunction when no payment.</b> - When one brings a petition in equity seeking to enjoin a sale under a power of sale contained in a security deed, which deed contains an acceleration clause, alleging as ground for injunction that one is entitled to a credit on the indebtedness secured thereby, "and that the proper application of said credit will liquidate all of the installments claimed to be in arrears, leaving nothing past due on said indebtedness," and when, on interlocutory hearing, it appears from the evidence that upon proper application of the alleged credit there would still be a considerable amount past due, and there is no offer to pay or tender to the grantee in the security deed of the amounts due thereunder, it is not error for the judge to refuse to grant an injunction. Brinson v. Federal Land Bank, 182 Ga. 477, 185 S.E. 828 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Benefits to opposite party prior to cancellation.</b> - Before a borrower who has executed to the same grantee two deeds to secure debts can have affirmative equitable relief to set aside a sale by the creditor under exercise of the power of sale contained in the deeds, and an injunction against the creditor and the persons claiming under the creditor to prevent interference with the debtor's possession of a portion of the property, such debtor must pay or tender to the creditor the principal and interest which the debtor admits to be due, and would not be relieved of this duty by reason of the fact that the creditor was demanding of the debtor more than the debtor owed. Harpe v. Stone, 212 Ga. 341, 92 S.E.2d 522 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Before an instrument can be canceled the benefits received thereunder must be returned or tendered to the opposite party. Brooks v. Southern Clays, Inc., 220 Ga. 152, 137 S.E.2d 630 (1964). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Before a borrower, who has executed a deed infected with usury, can have affirmative equitable relief, such as injunction to prevent exercise of the power of sale by the grantee in such security deed, one must pay or tender to the grantee the principal sum due.

<p class="p4"><b>Municipalities must also do equity.</b> - When a municipality makes proof of its claim to the superintendent of banks (now commissioner of banking and finance) on the basis of a creditor and obtains from the superintendent of banks one or more dividends on an equal basis with general depositors, before the municipality would be authorized to come into equity seeking to declare an implied trust to be impressed upon the general funds remaining in the hands of the superintendent of banks and priority over general depositors in the distribution of such funds, it would be necessary for the municipality to do equity by returning such portion of the dividends received by it as were derived from assessments against stockholders. Town of Douglasville v. Mobley, 169 Ga. 53, 149 S.E. 575 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Ready and willing to pay is not sufficient.</b> - One seeking equitable relief from the enforcement of a tax execution based upon an assessment allegedly excessive, or for other cause, but admitting, as here, that one owes a part of the tax covered by such execution, must, prior to the institution of an equitable action for cancellation and injunction, pay or offer to pay the amount of taxes admitted to be due, in order to obtain the relief sought. An allegation that one is "ready and willing to pay" an amount of tax admitted to be due is not an "offer" to pay as required by law. Zugar v. Scarbrough, 186 Ga. 310, 197 S.E. 854 (1938); Holloway v. De Vane, 212 Ga. 182, 91 S.E.2d 350 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Petition seeking an injunction either to restrain tax sales or to prevent a continuation of the alleged discriminatory assessment practice, was fatally defective for its failure to allege a tender at least of the amounts which would have been due by the plaintiffs as taxes if their real estate had been assessed for taxation at the lowest basis of value applied to the more favorably treated personalty. Mayor of Savannah v. Fawcett, 186 Ga. 132, 197 S.E. 253 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In suit to cancel a tax deed upon the ground of excessive levy, seeking an accounting as to some of the defendants and general relief as to all of the defendants when it appeared from allegations of the petition that each of the defendants was liable to the plaintiffs for trespass upon the property in a sum greater than the amount of the taxes for which the property was sold, and that the plaintiffs were willing to do equity, the allegations in regard to excessive levy and the prayer for cancellation on that ground were not deficient for failure of the plaintiffs to allege a previous tender of the amount of the taxes. Zugar v. Scarbrough, 186 Ga. 310, 197 S.E. 854 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A tax sale that is not specifically attacked on the ground that the levy of the execution was excessive, but is attacked on the ground that the sheriff failed to sell the realty levied on according to the advertisement of sale, which recited that so much of the realty levied on would be sold as was sufficient to satisfy the executions, and instead sold the realty in bulk although the realty was capable of subdivision into lots or tracts less than the whole which could have been sold for the amount of the executions, would not prevent the application of this equitable principle. Durham v. Smith, 186 Ga. 565, 198 S.E. 734 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One who by inheritance succeeds to the interest of such original owner in the property will not be heard in equity when seeking to cancel the deed of the purchaser at such sale, on the ground that the levy was excessive, without paying or offering to pay all unpaid taxes due on that property when the ownership thereon was in the person from whom it was inherited. Lowe v. City of Atlanta, 191 Ga. 76, 11 S.E.2d 891 (1940), later appeal, 194 Ga. 317, 21 S.E.2d 171 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One seeking relief against collection of municipal taxes on the ground of excessiveness of the levies, or for other cause, but admitting, either expressly or by necessary implication, that one owes part of the tax covered by such executions, must pay or offer to pay the amount of the taxes admitted to be due, in order to obtain the relief sought.

<p class="p4">When there is no allegation in a petition that property owners have paid or offered to pay the city any amount as the taxes due on the property, the owners are for such failure in no position to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the city from selling their property under executions for taxes due. Smith v. City of E. Ellijay, 217 Ga. 364, 122 S.E.2d 112 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a taxpayer seeks to prevent the collection of an ad valorem tax, and the taxpayer admits, either expressly or impliedly, that the taxpayer is liable for at least a part of the tax sought to be collected the taxpayer must first pay or offer to pay the amount of the tax legally due, before enjoining the tax's collection.

<p class="p4"><b>Application of equity in realty transactions.</b> - As a general rule a petition to a court of equity to cancel a deed as a cloud on the title of the grantor, brought by the executrices of the grantor's estate, on the basis that it is void as representing a sale by a wife of her separate estate to her husband, for a valuable consideration, without an order of the superior court of her domicile, when there is no offer to return the consideration recited and acknowledged in the deed to have been received, is demurrable (now motion to dismiss), but when it is alleged in an amendment to the petition that the consideration stated in the deed from the wife to the husband has been only partly paid to a stated amount, that the defendant has been in possession of the property so conveyed for a stated number of years, that the rents, issues, and profits for that period are at least a stated amount, and an offer is made to pay the defendant any difference between the consideration actually paid and the rents, issues, and profits, and the petition contains a prayer for general relief as well as for cancellation and injunction, such allegation by amendment is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this section, and it is not necessary that a formal tender of the consideration stated in the deed be made. Franklin v. Cruce, 187 Ga. 58, 200 S.E. 135 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A borrower who has executed a deed to secure a debt is not entitled to an injunction against a sale of the property under a power in the deed, unless one first pays or tenders to the creditor the amount admittedly due.

<p class="p4">In suit by wife for injunction against sale of property under deed, if the petition has shown upon its face, either expressly or impliedly, that any part of the purchase-money had been paid by or for the bank, or that any binding obligation for such payment had been made, it may be that the plaintiff could not maintain an action for equitable relief without averring a repayment of the sum or a tender thereof before suit, or alleging some valid reason for her failure to do so. Deen v. Baxley State Bank, 192 Ga. 300, 15 S.E.2d 194 (1941). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When vendees of land may have been excused from tendering the correct amount, or any amount, to the vendor before suit for specific performance, this does not relieve the vendor from offering in their pleadings to pay the amount which is due or the amount which might be found due by decree of the court. Lively v. Munday, 201 Ga. 409, 40 S.E.2d 62 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Shepard v. Gettys, 206 Ga. 392, 57 S.E.2d 272 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When purchaser seeking performance of contract of purchase of realty offered to do equity by paying the full amount of the purchase price, but the defendant repudiated the contract and declared the defendant's intentions not to carry out the contract, the defendant's repudiation was a waiver of tender, and under the law relieved the petitioner of any obligation to tender. Shepard v. Gettys, 206 Ga. 392, 57 S.E.2d 272 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err by dismissing a homeowner's claim against the homeowner's mortgage lender for injunctive relief following foreclosure of the homeowner's home because under application of the maxim that one who would have equity must do equity, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-10, the owner was required to tender the amount due under the security deed and note.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When one party in default.</b> - Since a defendant is not required to perform under the terms of a contract if the plaintiff is currently in default, specific performance may not be decreed against appellee unless it is conditioned on appellant's curing of any default on the appellant's part, but if the decree is so conditioned, this section will be satisfied. Jordan v. Flynt, 240 Ga. 359, 240 S.E.2d 858 (1977); Krauth v. Bagley, 243 Ga. 87, 252 S.E.2d 504 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The decree of specific performance is improper when the plaintiff was in default at the time suit was filed, the plaintiff remains in default at the time of the decree, and the decree of specific performance is not conditional on the plaintiff curing the plaintiff's default. Jordan v. Flynt, 240 Ga. 359, 240 S.E.2d 858 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff defaulting after filing suit.</b> - When the plaintiff is not in default when the plaintiff files suit, the occurrence of a subsequent default of the plaintiff is not by itself a sufficient reason for denying specific performance. Krauth v. Bagley, 243 Ga. 87, 252 S.E.2d 504 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cancellation of deed when parties not in compliance</b> - Petition for cancellation of deed was not subject to demurrer (now motion to dismiss) because the petitioner failed to tender to the defendant moneys paid for taxes, improvements, interest, and payment on loan, as well as the consideration paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, when the petition alleged that no part of the consideration named in the deed had been paid and that the rent collected by the defendant was enough to have paid the installments and interest due against that property, and there was nothing in the record to indicate that any improvements were made by the defendant, or any taxes paid by the defendant. Wellborn v. Johnson, 204 Ga. 389, 50 S.E.2d 16 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisites to recovery following tax sale.</b> - While ordinarily, before one would be entitled to set aside a tax sale on the grounds that the levy under the execution was excessive, one must tender to the purchaser at such sale the amount paid by such purchaser at the sale, no such tender is required when the petition alleges that the purchaser had not paid any part of the amount of its bid to the sheriff. Bibb County v. Elkan, 184 Ga. 520, 192 S.E. 7 (1937); Durham v. Smith, 186 Ga. 565, 198 S.E. 734 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Generally, equity will not cancel a conveyance under which anything has been received, until repayment is made.</b> An exception to the rule requiring tender is when the petition alleges that the defendant has been in possession, receiving the rents and profits of the premises conveyed, and prays for an accounting therefor by the defendant, and that the correct amount due the defendant be declared and set up. Harrell v. Burch, 195 Ga. 96, 23 S.E.2d 434 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Uncertainity of tax execution impacting equity.</b> - Allegations of a petition that the petitioner's mutual savings and loan association has been unable to ascertain the exact amount that a tax execution should have issued for, and that the taxing authorities of the city have "refused to ascertain the exact amount legally due by" petitioner, when considered in the light of the fact that the city contends that the total amount of the execution is the amount "legally due" and that the ascertainment of the amount for which the petitioner contends the execution should have issued is a mere matter of mathematical calculation, based upon the valuation of the property which the petitioner admits is legally taxable and the tax rate applicable thereto, do not allege a sufficient reason for the failure of the petitioner to pay or offer to pay the amount admittedly due. Elder v. Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 185 Ga. 258, 194 S.E. 745 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of relief in equity.</b> - When to a proceeding to foreclose a deed to secure debt as an equitable mortgage, which prays for judgment for principal, interest, and attorney's fees, a debtor files a plea in which it is alleged that the petitioner held as collateral fire insurance policies with a loss-payable clause in favor of the petitioner aggregating more than the amount of the debt, which had become due and payable as the result of a fire some months before there was a default on the debt, and that the insurance could have been collected at any time, but was not collected due solely to the negligence of the petitioner who had made no demand for payment, and that the attorney's fees sought in the foreclosure proceeding would have been unnecessary had such collection been made, such plea alleged facts sufficient to show a breach of duty, both in law and in equity, upon the part of the creditor, which would prevent it from collecting attorney's fees and deny the creditor any relief in equity. Irwin v. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 204 Ga. 582, 50 S.E.2d 354 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment of additional expenses.</b> - When the creditor has negligently failed to perform the creditor's duty, which results in default on the main debt, the resulting injury or additional expense should be paid by the creditor rather than by the debtors. Irwin v. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 204 Ga. 582, 50 S.E.2d 354 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance denied.</b> - In a suit for specific performance, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the plaintiff because numerous fact issues remained, including whether the plaintiff made the requisite tender of the necessary documents and payment, whether the plaintiff's execution of corporate loan documents constituted a breach of the agreement and, if so, whether the breach was material, whether unclean hands barred the plaintiff's specific performance claim, and other issues.

<p class="p4"><b>This section is limited in its application</b> to cases in which the party chargeable makes the third party the party's real or apparent agent, cases in which the party provides the means intentionally, or for a dishonest purpose, or negligently, and cases in which the party derives a benefit from the fraud of the third party. Nowell v. Mayor of Monroe, 177 Ga. 648, 171 S.E. 136, answer conformed to, 47 Ga. App. 665, 171 S.E. 143 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This section does not govern the great majority of cases when one innocently, for an honest purpose and with reasonable care, furnishes to a third party the means by which one perpetrates a fraud from which one who provides the means derives no benefit. Nowell v. Mayor of Monroe, 177 Ga. 648, 171 S.E. 136 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conversion cases.</b> - The principle stated in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-14 is applicable in conversion cases. Atlanta Classic Cars, Inc. v. Chih Hung USA Auto Corp., 209 Ga. App. 908, 439 S.E.2d 498 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When items stolen from an electric company were sold to a supply company, the electric company was not entitled to summary judgment on its conversion claim against the supply company and its principal because of the equitable doctrine codified at O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-14, providing that, when one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third person, the individual who put it in the power of the third person to inflict the injury shall bear the loss as there were genuine fact issues as to whether the principal was innocent and whether the electric company's inattentiveness allowed its employee to steal the items with impunity. Fed. Ins. Co. v. Westside Supply Co., 264 Ga. App. 240, 590 S.E.2d 224 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability of auctioneer for conversion.</b> - The liability of an auctioneer for conversion does not extend to a case in which it is the true owner who originally enabled the auctioneer's principal to commit the underlying conversion and the auctioneer subsequently acts without knowledge of the principal's conversion. Benton v. Duvall Livestock Mktg., Inc., 201 Ga. App. 430, 411 S.E.2d 307 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability generally.</b> - When one of two innocent persons must bear a loss, the one who occasioned it or one's representative cannot obtain affirmative relief in a court for the purpose of placing the loss upon the other party, who was equally innocent. Atlanta Banking &amp; Sav. Co. v. Johnson, 179 Ga. 313, 175 S.E. 904 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a loss must be suffered which results from the acts of one of two people, i.e., the act of the owner in delivering a stock power signed in blank, and the act of the corporate officers in accepting from the broker an unauthorized power, it must fall upon the one who first trusted the defaulting broker. Frye v. Commonwealth Inv. Co., 107 Ga. App. 739, 131 S.E.2d 569, aff'd, 219 Ga. 498, 134 S.E.2d 39 (1963). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of equity when agents commit fraud.</b> - Equity required that as between the lender and the companies, the companies had to bear the loss for any alleged fraud by their agents. R.W. Holdco, Inc. v. SCI/RW Holdco, Inc., 250 Ga. App. 414, 551 S.E.2d 826 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No legal duty by franchisor to consumer.</b> - In a suit brought by a customer asserting conversion against an automobile franchisor and its financial company, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the franchisor and the financial company as the business entities owned no legal duty to the consumer to prevent the franchisee from presenting an unreasonable risk of harm to the customer. As such, the customer could not predicate liability for conversion under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-14 as a matter of law. DaimlerChrysler Motors Co. v. Clemente, 294 Ga.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One of the essential elements of a cause of action for the common-law tort of deceit based upon fraud</b> is the plaintiff's right to rely upon the representations. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., 113 Ga. App. 382, 148 S.E.2d 71, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 472, 150 S.E.2d 620 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The master could be held liable for the servant's fraudulent presentation</b> of invoices and receiving payment for more goods than were actually delivered by reason of having clothed the servant with apparent authority and upon the equitable principle contained in this section that as between two innocent persons that the master who put it in the power of the male-factor to inflict the loss should bear it. Lecroy v. Acme Meat Co., 125 Ga. App. 566, 188 S.E.2d 255 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under ordinary conditions, in cases when a fraud has been committed by an agent, this rule (contained in this section) has been invoked against the agent's principal for the reason that the employer, by clothing the agent with apparent authority to act for the principal, has made the accomplishment of the fraud possible. But the doctrine applies with equal force against the defrauded third person when it appears the third party could have easily detected the deceit and neglected to do so for, under such circumstances, the third party's fault must be regarded as the proximate and efficient cause of the loss. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., 113 Ga. App. 382, 148 S.E.2d 71, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 472, 150 S.E.2d 620 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A principal who puts a servant or other agent in a position which enables the agent while apparently acting within the agent's authority, to commit a fraud upon third persons is subject to liability to such third persons for the fraud. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., 113 Ga. App. 382, 148 S.E.2d 71, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 472, 150 S.E.2d 620 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Misrepresentations are not actionable unless the plaintiff was justified in relying upon the misrepresentations in the exercise of common prudence and diligence.</b> The misrepresentations must have been made under such circumstances that the injured party had a right to rely on the misrepresentations. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., 113 Ga. App. 382, 148 S.E.2d 71, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 472, 150 S.E.2d 620 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A person who otherwise would be liable to another for the misrepresentations of one apparently acting for that person is not relieved from liability by the fact that the servant or agent acts entirely for one's own purposes, unless the other has notice of this. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., 113 Ga. App. 382, 148 S.E.2d 71, rev'd on other grounds, 222 Ga. 472, 150 S.E.2d 620 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Application to sale of automobile.</b> - When the owner of an automobile offers it for sale at an auction, and it is unconditionally delivered to such purchaser, the seller accepting a check for the purchase price, and such purchaser sells it for a valuable consideration to a third person who has no notice of the giving of the check, the title of the original owner is divested or the original owner is estopped from asserting it as against the innocent third-party purchaser although the check is unpaid and returned as worthless. Blount v. Bainbridge, 79 Ga. App. 99, 53 S.E.2d 122 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the owner of an automobile voluntarily relinquished possession of it to a third person who gave him a worthless check, the owner is precluded from disputing, as against a bona fide purchaser, the existence of any title or power of sale, which through the original owner's own lack of caution, negligence or mistaken confidence, the original owner caused or allowed to appear to be vested in the third person with whom the innocent purchaser dealt. Equitable Credit &amp; Disct. Co. v. Murray, 79 Ga. App. 795, 54 S.E.2d 650 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application to agreement between spouses and innocent third party.</b> - Wife's transfer and delivery of stock certificate to her husband operates to invest the husband with such external indicia of ownership that his pledge to an innocent lender is, on the principle of estoppel, binding upon her. The private understanding between a wife and her husband that she was merely lending the stock to him does not affect the right of the bank to hold the stock as security for a loan when the bank acted innocently and without knowledge of such agreement. Groover v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 186 Ga. 476, 198 S.E. 217 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistaken identity.</b> - When the defendant loan company made check payable to name given by the person who made application for a loan, delivered the check to that person, and did not question the person's identity, the loan company and not the plaintiff who subsequently cashed the check for payee, knowing the payee by the name thereon, was responsible for the mistaken identity, if any, of the person to whom it issued and delivered the check. Peoples Loan &amp; Sav. Co. v. Pardue, 56 Ga. App. 632, 193 S.E. 486 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Sales to innocent third parties.</b> - Rule that when an owner has given to another such evidence of the right of selling the owner's goods as, according to the custom of trade or the common understanding of the world, usually accompanies the authority of disposal, or has given the external indicia of the right of disposing of the owner's property, a sale to an innocent purchaser divests the true owner's title, is merely a special application of the rule embodied in this section that, "When one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third person, he who put it in the power of the third person to inflict the injury shall bear the loss."

<p class="p4"><b>No claim to nonjudicial foreclosure sale.</b> - The son had no claim to the proceeds of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale conducted by his father when the son had executed a promissory note and deed to his father for the express purpose of delaying, hindering, or defrauding a potential judgment creditor, and thus had unclean hands, and the evidence showed that the proceeds did not exceed the amount of the promissory note, interest, advertising costs, and attorney fees.

That inquiry would include an examination of the indenture that would give the purchaser notice of the bond trustee's mortgage and, thus, the mortgage lien was enforceable against a bona fide purchaser, and the mortgage lien was not avoidable under the Bankruptcy Code.

<p class="p4"><b>No duty to inquire arose.</b> - In a declaratory judgment action brought by the purchasers of certain real property to remove a cloud from the purchasers' title asserted by a bank who had obtained a writ of fieri facias (the lien) against one of the sellers, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the bank and holding that the purchasers had a duty to inquire as to prior names used by that seller. The purchasers provided expert testimony that the lien using that seller's married name had not been recorded and, in turn, the bank failed to present any evidence to dispute the affidavits of the purchasers' witnesses or to cite to any authority which imposed a duty on the purchasers or the purchasers' agents to investigate prior or alternative names of that seller when nothing occurred prior to or during the closing that created a duty to inquire and that seller had falsely sworn under oath that the property was not subject to any encumbrances or liens and that there were no outstanding judgments.

<p class="p4">Chapter 7 trustee was a bona fide purchaser for value as of the petition date under Georgia law as no security deed was of record in the debtors' chain of title and there was nothing in the record to put the trustee on inquiry notice of the existence of a bank's unrecorded security deed and, thus, the trustee could avoid the bank's security deed under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 544(a)(3) and recover the property for the benefit of the estate under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 550. The court rejected the bank's argument that the bank should be equitably subrogated to the rights of a prior lender whose loan was satisfied by the bank's loan because even if the bank was correct, a subrogee could have no greater rights than the party to whose rights it was subrogated, and the lender cancelled the lender's security deed prior to the petition date so that any subrogated rights of the bank were terminated at the same time.

<p class="p4">The fact that the attorneys for the purchaser, and therefore the purchaser, have actual knowledge of the pendency of a suit for a money judgment in a tort action will not charge them with notice of the rendition of a judgment in that case, where no execution had been issued and recorded as provided by the statute, and they will not be chargeable with negligence, and therefore with notice, because they did not examine the papers in the suit, examine the bar docket, examine the minutes of the court, or make inquiry of plaintiff's counsel in that case, for: "What the law requires . . . to put innocent third parties upon notice of the existence of a judgment lien is an entry of the execution upon a certain record in the office of the clerk of the superior court. Where there is a failure to make such record, third parties are not charged with any duty to make an investigation or inquiry in relation to the existence of such a lien against their vendor." Jackson v. Faver, 210 Ga. 58, 77 S.E.2d 728 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Once a cab company had knowledge that the diagnosis of a physician showed a cab operator-employee was subject to recurring loss of consciousness which rendered it dangerous for him to drive, mere failure of the cab company to ascertain whether or not he had made a recovery would fall under the head of "negligent ignorance" which would be insufficient to relieve it from liability for the unfortunate consequences following upon a seizure while the defendant was operating the taxicab. Jackson v. Co-op Cab Co., 102 Ga. App. 688, 117 S.E.2d 627 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Notice which would charge a purchaser of personal property with negligence in not discovering a defect in the vendor's title, which the vendor impliedly warranted in the sale, is not the constructive notice derived from the record in the clerk's office as required by law of instruments affecting the title to property, before a purchaser can be charged with negligence in failing to discover a defect in the vendor's title to the property sold, the purchaser must have had actual notice of the defect, or notice of a fact sufficient to put the purchaser upon inquiry as to the state of the title to the property. Perrin v. Reardon, 44 Ga. App. 823, 163 S.E. 300 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The failure of a petitioner to know the content defining the coverage of its insurance contract or to compare the facts and circumstances surrounding the injury to ascertain if it was covered thereby, and its failure to inquire of the employer or the industrial board (Board of Worker's Compensation) as to the existence of an insurance contract with another insurance carrier that covered the injury, amounted to negligence on the part of the petitioner, and would not constitute such a mistake of fact as would render the agreement and the payments thereunder involuntary and, therefore, a basis for subrogation. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 202 Ga. 752, 44 S.E.2d 543 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Subrogation for voluntary payments is not allowed. Subrogation will be allowed, (1) where there are existing circumstances which in equity amount to an implied agreement for subrogation; or (2) where there is an agreement with either the debtor or the creditor whereby one making the payment will be subrogated to the rights and remedies of the original creditor. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 202 Ga. App. 752, 44 S.E.2d 543 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One failing to inform himself, but having equal opportunity of learning the truth, must suffer the consequences of his neglect. Rustin Stamp &amp; Coin Shop, Inc. v. Ray Bros. Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co., 175 Ga. App. 30, 332 S.E.2d 341 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where purchaser was under constructive notice as to the legal description of his own deed, which incorporated the recorded plat by reference, and as to the ownership of the lot he believed he was buying but that was owned by another, his failure to conduct a title examination was the sole proximate cause of injuries and his negligence action was barred.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of doctrine of lis pendens.</b> - Lis pendens, whether it be from the common law as provided in this section or by statute (T. 44, Ch. 14, Art. 9), has for its purpose the protection of innocent purchasers of real property involved in pending litigation. Patent Scaffolding Co. v. Byers, 220 Ga. 426, 139 S.E.2d 332 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lis pendens is the jurisdiction, power, or control which courts acquire over property involved in a suit,</b> pending the continuance of the action, and until the final judgment therein. Coleman v. Law, 170 Ga. 906, 154 S.E. 445 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The underlying, if not the sole, object of the maxim "pendente lite nihil innoverture," is to keep the subject of the suit or res within the power of the court until the judgment or decree shall be entered, and thus to make it possible for courts of justice to give effect to their judgments and decrees. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., 177 Ga. 318, 170 S.E. 294 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While special circumstances may alter the rule, it is the general rule that where the rights of the plaintiff to the property in question are secured under the rule of lis pendens, the judge in the exercise of his discretion may refuse an interlocutory injunction. Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. McAllister, 188 Ga. 626, 4 S.E.2d 558 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An application in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to probate a will, which, although denied for lack of evidence to prove it, was still pending therein, was not a suit within the meaning of the law of lis pendens, and did not operate so as to affect the title of one who purchased at the sale of the administrator, the appointment and sale taking place subsequently to an order of the ordinary (now probate judge) denying probate, although the will on the original application was thereafter duly probated. Scarborough v. Long, 186 Ga. 412, 197 S.E. 796, cert. denied, 305 U.S. 637, 59 S. Ct. 107, 83 L. Ed. 410 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>To the existence of a valid and effective lis pendens, it is essential that three elements be present:</b> the property must be of a character to be subject to the rule; the court must have jurisdiction both of the person and the subject matter, and the property involved must be sufficiently described in the pleadings. Walker v. Houston, 176 Ga. 878, 169 S.E. 107 (1933); Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., 177 Ga. 318, 170 S.E. 294 (1933); Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. McAllister, 188 Ga. 626, 4 S.E.2d 558 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The general rule is that lis pendens, duly prosecuted, and not collusive, is notice to purchaser so as to affect and bind his interest by the decree.</b> Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. McAllister, 188 Ga. 626, 4 S.E.2d 558 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lis pendens in itself does not create a lien of any kind,</b> but merely charges the purchaser with notice of the pending action. If the judgment in the pending action does not create a lien on the property, certainly notice of the action will not. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., 177 Ga. 318, 170 S.E. 294 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>2. Application of Doctrine</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The doctrine of lis pendens applies to a suit brought by a creditor to prevent his debtor from conveying his property away</b> with the fraudulent intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditor. Coleman v. Law, 170 Ga. 906, 154 S.E. 445 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Actions to reach property which has been fraudulently conveyed and suits to subject specific property to the payment of debts come within the doctrine of lis pendens. Coleman v. Law, 170 Ga. 906, 154 S.E. 445 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The rule of lis pendens applies to a creditor's suit to set aside a fraudulent conveyance made to defeat the creditor, so that the purchasers or other persons, acquiring interests pendente lite, take title subject to the decree in the suit. Coleman v. Law, 170 Ga. 906, 154 S.E. 445 (1930); Walker v. Houston, 176 Ga. 878, 169 S.E. 107 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The doctrine of lis pendens, properly understood and applied, will prevent a stranger from dealing with any of the parties to a pending proceeding in which a title to, or an interest in, or a lien upon designated and described real property is sought to be enforced after the proceeding is filed, and before the final decree, so as to acquire any interest in the premises involved capable of withstanding the force of the decree, or frustrating its full legal effect. Atlanta Nat'l Bank v. Brown, 173 Ga. 213, 159 S.E. 874 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a lessee for sawmill purposes of growing trees sells the same on a valuable consideration, and afterwards colludes with a third person, who at the time of the sale has a suit pending against such lessee to establish and enforce an outstanding equitable interest in the trees, and so colluding accepts a valuable consideration from the third person, and on the basis thereof allows a consent verdict and decree for the plaintiff without trial of the issues in the case, such verdict and decree will be subject to collateral attack by the vendee as void on the ground of fraud, and will not be protected on the principle of lis pendens. In such a situation such third person should be treated as a subsequent purchaser, and not as one whose original claim became adjudicated in his favor. Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. Burgin Lumber Co., 193 Ga. 404, 18 S.E.2d 774 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A suit for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land is "notice" of the claim that the plaintiff sets up therein, from the time it is commenced and docketed; and if duly prosecuted and not collusive, one purchasing the land pending the suit is affected by the final decree rendered therein, though the suit is in a county other than the one in which the land is located. Walker v. Houston, 176 Ga. 878, 169 S.E. 107 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lis pendens does not apply to choses in action.</b> Shadburn Banking Co. v. Streetman, 180 Ga. 500, 179 S.E. 377 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restrictive covenants.</b> - A lis pendens notice stating a claim to a contract right to buy certain lots in a subdivision serves as notice to future purchasers of other lots in the subdivision that the lots described in the lis pendens notice are not encumbered by restrictive covenants recorded after the contract but before the sale of the other lots. Puryear v. Deakins, 258 Ga. 618, 373 S.E.2d 15 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Bona fide purchaser obtains good title notwithstanding forgery in chain of title.</b> - Bonner v. Norwest Bank Inc., 275 Ga. 620 (2002), is inconsistent with the Second Refuge Church Inc. v.

Deutsche Bank Inc., 277 Ga. App. 764, (2006), is likewise overruled as Mabra also runs contrary to the Lollar line of cases, which does not recognize that the bona fide purchaser for value doctrine may apply when forgery occurs between spouses.

<p class="p4">A son shown to have been born subsequently to the execution of a will is not entitled to recover in ejectment against a purchaser for a valid consideration who relied on the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) probating the will in solemn form, and who purchased prior to any proceeding to set aside such judgment. Mitchell v. Arnall, 203 Ga. 384, 47 S.E.2d 258 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where an administrator sells his decedent's estate at public outcry and he buys back as an individual the property on the same day that he as administrator conveyed it away, the fact that the deeds were made on the same day and recited the same consideration does not amount to a void administrator's sale, and notice of the alleged fraud is not presumed. When later purchasers of the land pay value in money for the land purchased, they are presumed to be bona fide purchasers without notice. Thomas v. Couch, 171 Ga. 602, 156 S.E. 206 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It was not error to refuse to charge the principle that, when one attests a deed with full knowledge of its contents, he is estopped to assert an interest in the land conveyed outstanding in himself against the grantee; the evidence that a witness to petitioner's tax deed was an agent of the owner and grantor of the defendant did not authorize it, and even if the act and knowledge of the agent were attributed to the owner, defendant, without notice thereof, would not be bound.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of real estate to innocent purchaser divests title of heirs.</b> - Superior court did not err in granting a purchaser summary judgment in an administrator's action alleging that the purchaser aided and abetted an executor's breach of fiduciary duties when it bought properties from the executor but did not meet its burden of proving payment merely by producing recitations of the alleged consideration; the probate court's order authorizing the executor to disburse estate property was valid on its face, the sale did not violate the terms of the power of sale in a testatrix's will, and the sale of real estate to an innocent purchaser divested the title of the heirs, although there could be irregularities.

<p class="p4"><b>Prior possession of land is not notice to a purchaser.</b> - Possession of real property which will charge a purchaser with notice is possession at the time the purchaser obtains his title.

Thompson v. Randall, 173 Ga. 696, 161 S.E. 377 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impact of forgery upon bona fide purchaser.</b> - Trial court erred in holding that a mortgage company had a valid security interest as to the other one-half undivided interest in certain property because the company could not acquire a valid security interest in the entire property by virtue of the company's status, if any, as a bona fide purchaser for value; a bona fide purchaser for value, or a security deed holder occupying such position, obtains good title notwithstanding a forgery in the chain of title. Brock v. Yale Mortg. Corp., 287 Ga. 849, 700 S.E.2d 583 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A 2003 warranty deed that operated to release a prior lender's security interest in the property was not a forgery but was signed by someone fraudulently assuming the authority of an officer of the prior lender and was regular on the deed's face. Therefore, a subsequent lender that foreclosed on the property and purchased the property at the foreclosure sale was a bona fide purchaser for value entitled to take the property free of the prior lender's security interest. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 307 Ga. App. 307, 704 S.E.2d 823 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purchasers entitled to protection of bona fide purchaser for value.</b> - There was no error in the trial court's grant of summary judgment to a bank and nursery in a daughter's action to cancel deeds executed by her mother before her death to the bank and the nursery because they were entitled to the protection of bona fide purchaser for value under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 23-1-19 and 23-1-20; the title search showed that the property was transferred to the mother via the will of the daughter's father through a trustees deed of distribution from the remainder trust to the primary beneficiary of the trust, and there was nothing in the chain of title or the trust instruments that would put either the bank or nursery on notice that there were any issues affecting title to the properties because the wording of the trusts allowed the trustees to sell or dispose of any property, at any time, for reasons the trustees deemed best, for the benefit of the mother. Kitchings v. Ameris Bank, 309 Ga. App. 837, 711 S.E.2d 392 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement to supply water did not obligate purchaser without notice.</b> - Even if an agreement between property owners providing that the property with a well would supply water to the adjacent property was a covenant running with the land, a later purchaser of the well property did not have actual or constructive notice of that agreement and was not bound by that agreement because the agreement was recorded outside the chain of title.

<p class="p4"><b>Protection of purchaser with notice predicated on bona fides of vendor.</b> - A purchaser of land with notice of outstanding equities, from one who was without notice thereof and was entitled to status of bona fide purchaser, will be protected in his title on account of the bona fides of his vendor, and it is wholly immaterial of what nature the equity is, whether it is a lien, or an encumbrance, or a trust, or any other claim; for a bona fide purchaser of an estate, for a valuable consideration, purges away the equity from the estate in the hands of all persons who may derive title to it. Thompson v. Randall, 173 Ga. 696, 161 S.E. 377 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A deed of prior date loses its priority over a subsequent deed from the same vendor, which is based on a valuable consideration, taken without notice of the existence of the first and is the second deed being the first to go to record in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the land lies, and even if the vendee in the second deed took with notice, a grantee of the latter who took without notice would be protected.

<p class="p4"><b>Section constitutes mandatory charge to jury.</b> - Where this section is applicable to a case, and warranted both by the pleadings and the evidence, it should be given as a charge to the jury, even in the absence of a request. Anderson v. Barron, 208 Ga. 785, 69 S.E.2d 874 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Bona fide purchaser obtains good title notwithstanding forgery in chain of title.</b> - Trial court erred in holding that a mortgage company had a valid security interest as to the other one-half undivided interest in certain property because the company could not acquire a valid security interest in the entire property by virtue of the company's status, if any, as a bona fide purchaser for value; a bona fide purchaser for value, or a security deed holder occupying such position, obtains good title notwithstanding a forgery in the chain of title.

<p class="p4">Bonner v. Norwest Bank Inc., 275 Ga. 620 (2002), is inconsistent with the Second Refuge Church Inc. v. Lollar, 282 Ga. 721 (2007), line of cases and is overruled to the extent that the case extends the bona fide purchaser for value doctrine to those acquiring title under a grantee in a forged deed; Mabra v. Deutsche Bank Inc., 277 Ga. App. 764 (2006), is likewise overruled as Mabra also runs contrary to the Lollar line of cases, which does not recognize that the bona fide purchaser for value doctrine may apply when forgery occurs between spouses. Brock v. Yale Mortg. Corp., 287 Ga. 849, 700 S.E.2d 583 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>A bona fide purchaser without notice acquires an unqualified legal right and title to the property purchased;</b> and a court of equity has no jurisdiction to interfere with such vested legal right and title. Gamble v. Brooks, 170 Ga. 662, 153 S.E. 759 (1930); Jenkins v. Sosebee, 74 Bankr. 440 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Therefore, a bona fide purchaser for value, and without notice of an equity, will not be interfered with by a court of equity</b> and this doctrine proceeds on the idea that the equity of the innocent purchaser is superior to that of the cestui que trust, who stands silently by and permits such purchaser to act to his own injury, or who is guilty of laches in not sooner asserting a mere secret equity. Gamble v. Brooks, 170 Ga. 662, 153 S.E. 759 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plaintiff may not reform his deed because of mutual mistake, third party acquired her title subsequently to that deed and is an innocent purchaser without notice of such mistake. Cox v. Zucker, 214 Ga. 44, 102 S.E.2d 580 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the absolute title to property is apparently in a vendor or mortgagor, the vendee or mortgagee is protected, unless the one seeking to set up a lien or trust against the property can show that the vendee or mortgagee had notice of trust funds having gone into the property.

<p class="p4"><b>Reformation of agreement was not permitted against bona fide purchaser of promissory note.</b> - In a suit on a promissory note by a lender's assignee, although some evidence supported the borrowers' claim that terms in a Forbearance Agreement (FA) binding the guarantors were the product of mutual mistake and release of the guarantors was intended, the trial court erred in reforming the FA because the borrowers had not overcome the presumption that the assignee was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the mistake. Hamilton State Bank v. Kelly Capital Invs., LLC, 335 Ga. App. 252, 779 S.E.2d 757 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>While it is the rule that a bona fide purchaser of property in which trust funds have been invested is protected,</b> the beneficiary of a trust estate may at his option, within a reasonable time, "affirm or reject an unauthorized investment by the trustee," and equity will aid the beneficiary in recovering the funds or property, or enforcing a lien for the wrongfully used funds, provided that the assets can be traced and remain in the hands of a person "affected with notice of the misapplication." Tattnall Bank v. Harvey, 186 Ga. 752, 198 S.E. 724 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While proof of payment of the purchase money alone raises a presumption of good faith, and carries the burden of claimant, where no testimony was introduced to prove that the consideration recited in the deed was in fact paid, nor was it otherwise proved to have been paid, the recital of the consideration in the deed and the recital therein that it was paid does not carry the burden of proving payment of the purchase money.

<p class="p4">The fact that the owner of the automobile, estranged from her husband, negligently allowed her husband to get possession of the keys and the automobile and to thereafter drive it to another city and sell it to a dealer in automobiles of the same make was not such an act as clothed the husband, who had no interest therein, with the external indicia of ownership and right of disposition, so as to enable him to pass the dealer such title to the automobile that the dealer could in turn give to a third-party purchaser clear title which would defeat the right of the true owner to recover the same in a trover action, nor did the act require a finding that the third-party purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any infirmity in the title to the automobile.

<p class="p4">Where one purchases land at an administrator's sale duly authorized by order of the court of ordinary (now probate court), which land was in the possession of such administrator, his deed will not be canceled on the petition of parties claiming an equitable title to such land, of which equity the purchaser had no notice. Beecher v. Carter, 189 Ga. 234, 5 S.E.2d 648 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a purchaser of land from one in possession, who holds a deed thereto which is absolute on its face, has paid the purchase price and taken possession, parties claiming an equity therein of which the purchaser had no notice are not entitled to have the purchaser's deed canceled.

<p class="p4">Where third-party purchasers of chattels were bona fide purchasers for value without notice of the chattel mortgages, it is not error to sustain their general demurrers (now motions to dismiss) to the mortgagee's petition for equitable foreclosure.

<p class="p4"><b>Purchaser must retain bona fides until purchase money actually paid.</b> - It is a rule in equity that a bona fide purchaser without notice, to be entitled to protection, must be so, not only at the time of the contract or conveyance, but until the purchase money is actually paid. Ross v. Rambo, 195 Ga. 100, 23 S.E.2d 687 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A partial payment of the purchase money before notice of the equitable title of the true owners, although not sufficient to invest the vendee with the character of a bona fide purchaser as regards the entire estate purchased, will entitle him to invoke the aid of the equitable principle that he who asks equity must do equity and to be reimbursed for the amount actually paid before.

<p class="p4"><b>Bona fide purchaser status properly denied.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying purchasers and the holders of two outstanding security deeds bona fide purchaser status because a quitclaim deed showed on the deed's face that a parent signed the deed as the children's purported "guardian"; thus, the designation of a "guardian" in the chain of title put the purchasers and holders on notice of the need to confirm the parent's legal authority to convey the children's interest in the property.

<p class="p4"><b>Determination of condition precedent or subsequent.</b> - While it is not always easy to determine whether the condition created by the terms of a conveyance is precedent or subsequent, the general rule is that, if the act or condition required does not necessarily precede the vesting of the estate, but may accompany or follow it, and if the act may as well be done after as before vesting of the estate, or if from the nature of the act to be performed, it is evidently the intention of the parties that the estate shall vest and the grantee perform the act taking possession, then the condition is subsequent. Gordon v. Whittle, 206 Ga. 339, 57 S.E.2d 169 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If, upon a strict construction of a deed in its entirety (there being no express words of defeasance), it should be doubtful whether the instrument created an estate upon condition subsequent, or the words employed imported covenant, the latter construction should be adopted. Fulford v. Fulford, 225 Ga. 9, 165 S.E.2d 848 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a deed purports to convey a fee simple title and there is no provision in the deed for a forfeiture of the estate or a reversion to the grantor in the event the grantee conveyed the property to another without the consent of his brothers, restrictive words in the deed are words of covenant and not a condition subsequent. Fulford v. Fulford, 225 Ga. 9, 165 S.E.2d 848 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A deed will not be construed as a grant on condition subsequent unless the language used by express terms creates an estate on condition or unless the intent of the grantor to create a conditional estate is manifest from a reading of the entire instrument. Gordon v. Whittle, 206 Ga. 339, 57 S.E.2d 169 (1950); Fulford v. Fulford, 225 Ga. 9, 165 S.E.2d 848 (1969); Floyd v. Hoover, 141 Ga.

<p class="p4">Deed that the grantor, in consideration of payment by grantees of certain indebtedness and of their support and maintenance of him during the remainder of his life, conveyed the described premises, did not create a condition subsequent which, upon the failure of the grantees to support and maintain the grantor, would result in a forfeiture of the estate conveyed, but such language created a covenant binding the grantees therein to perform; upon their failure to perform, if the grantor had been in life, he might have rescinded the contract by restoring to the grantees that part of the consideration represented by the payment of his indebtedness, offset by any profits they might have derived from the conveyance to them. Jones v. Reid, 184 Ga. 764, 193 S.E. 235 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Provision in deed that title "reverts back to the grantor if the grantee denies grantor her right to live on said property with him as his wife or without him" created a valid condition subsequent, and stipulated in terms that a breach of such condition by the grantee husband would cause the title to revert; and this would give to the grantor wife the right of reentry; however, if performance by the husband of such a condition subsequent was made impossible by acts or conduct on the part of the wife herself, the rule would be otherwise.

<p class="p4"><b>But while forfeitures are not favored, they are not altogether prohibited in this state.</b> Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Torrance, 110 Ga. App. 4, 137 S.E.2d 551 (1964), aff'd, 220 Ga. 639, 140 S.E.2d 840 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Conditions subsequent in deeds, although not favored, will be enforced by the court when they are clearly created and are not inconsistent with the other terms of the conveyance, and are not rendered impossible by the act of God or by the subsequent conduct of the grantor. Evans v. Brown, 196 Ga. 634, 27 S.E.2d 300 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While forfeitures are not unlawful, the law does not favor them, and all ambiguities in a contract are to be resolved against their existence; but where a contract in unmistakable terms provides for a forfeiture, and is otherwise free from legal infirmity, neither a court of law nor a court of equity will relieve against the forfeiture. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Torrance, 110 Ga. App. 4, 137 S.E.2d 551 (1964), aff'd, 220 Ga. 639, 140 S.E.2d 840 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The condition subsequent, with right of reentry, and forfeiture of the estate conveyed grantee, is not void because it could work a forfeiture. If a valid limitation imposed against alienation is interwoven with, so as to constitute a part of, the grant itself, the grant will be treated as a defeasible estate, and upon the inhibition being violated the estate conveyed is forfeited and terminates. Floyd v. Hoover, 141 Ga. App. 588, 234 S.E.2d 89 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Conditions in a deed which tend to destroy an estate are not favored in law and such conditions must be strictly construed against forfeiture. Kitchens v. Atlantic Steel Co., 123 Ga.

<p class="p4">Where there is a breach of a covenant which authorizes the forfeiture of the lease, the prompt assertion thereof by the lessor will operate to defeat the lessee's privilege to renew, however, forfeitures by acts of a party to a lease because of a breach of a covenant or condition are not favored by the courts. Pritchett v. King, 56 Ga. App. 788, 194 S.E. 44 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The general rule is that the breach by a lessee of the covenants or stipulations on his part contained in the lease does not work a forfeiture of the term in the absence of an express proviso to that effect in the lease, the lessor's remedy being by way of a claim for damages. Pritchett v. King, 56 Ga. App. 788, 194 S.E. 44 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a contract does not provide in express terms for a forfeiture upon a breach of the covenant, the presumption is that the lessor will be content with such right as is conferred by the ordinary remedies.

<p class="p4"><b>Election is choice between proffered benefit and retention of own property.</b> - An "election" in equity is a choice which a person is compelled to make between the acceptance of a benefit under an instrument and the retention of his own property which is attempted to be disposed of by that instrument. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The doctrine of election as applied to wills, against one claiming inconsistent benefits, arises when the testator "has attempted to give property not his own, and has given a benefit to a person to whom that property belongs," in which case "the devisee or legatee shall elect either to take under or against the will." It is applicable where the instrument confers upon one a benefit while attempting to dispose of his own property, in which event such person must elect whether to accept the benefit under the instrument or retain his property. However, this doctrine does not apply where testamentary disposition describes no specific property so as to identify it with that of the claimant, but describes the property only generally, as "all my real and personal property and all property of every kind and character owned by me at my death," since the testator would be presumed to have intended to bequeath only what he actually owned and could lawfully dispose of.

<p class="p4"><b>A case of election only arises when a person is entitled to one of two benefits to each of which he has the legal title,</b> and an election can exist only where there is a choice between two or more inconsistent remedies actually existing at the time of election. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The choice is compulsory between two inconsistent rights or claims where there is a clear intention of the testator that the beneficiary shall not enjoy both. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a testator, after devising property owned by him to one beneficiary, assumes to devise to another property belonging to the first devisee, the devisee of the property owned by the testator, if he accepts the devise with knowledge of the facts, is precluded from asserting a claim to his own property devised to the other beneficiary. The beneficiary must elect between keeping his own and taking what is given by the will. Rieves v. Smith, 184 Ga. 657, 192 S.E. 372 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The fact that a sheriff who had collected taxes which were unaccounted for, had given a bond with a surety, conditioned on the faithful performance of his duties, would not create a case for compulsory election, so as to require the county officials claiming the tax moneys to relinquish, for the benefit of a creditor bank, their direct claim of priority from the funds of the decedent in the registry of the court, and to proceed, with delay and additional expense, by a suit on the bond.

<p class="p4"><b>There is no principle of equity sounder, more conservative and more prolific, in all the fruits of peace, than this:</b> that he who slumbers over his rights, with no impediment to his asserting them, until the evidence upon which a counterclaim is founded, may from lapse of time, be presumed to be lost; until the generation cognizant of the transactions between the parties, has passed away, and until original actors are in their graves, and their affairs are left to representatives - the law, in the exercise of an equitable sovereignty, presumes it to be unjust, that under such circumstances, a complainant should be heard; and in nine cases out of ten, it is unjust in fact, as well as in theory. The principle upon which courts of equity proceed in such cases, is, that the lateness of the demand, arising from lapse of time, is presumptive evidence against its justice. Welch v. Welch, 215 Ga. 198, 109 S.E.2d 757 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">In a suit to rescind the sale of land, the plaintiff's voluntary failure to bring suit for three years after being fully cognizant of the fraud committed seven years prior thereto is such laches as will bar his action. Hillis v. Clark, 222 Ga. 604, 150 S.E.2d 922 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where no legal redemption of the land is alleged, or claimed, but the redemption is entirely an equitable one, persons claiming thereunder must assert their equitable demands within a reasonable time, for since equity rewards the vigilant, not the slothful, where the delay is such as to render the ascertainment of the truth difficult, equity will give no relief. Slade v. Barber, 200 Ga. 405, 37 S.E.2d 143 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even after the dissolution of a partnership, the statute of limitations does not begin to run in favor of one partner against another until the partnership affairs, as to debtors and creditors of the firm, have been wound up and settled, or, at least, a sufficient time has elapsed since the dissolution to raise the presumption that such was the fact, nor, while there are outstanding assets and liabilities, will a partner be barred as against his copartner, on the principle of stale demands. Powell v. Powell, 171 Ga. 840, 156 S.E. 677 (1931), later appeal, 179 Ga. 817, 177 S.E. 566 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes laches or staleness of demand,</b> and no one decision constitutes a precedent in the strict sense for another. Each case is to be determined according to its own particular circumstances. Laches is not, like limitations, a mere matter of time, but principally a question of the inequity of permitting the claim to be enforced, an inequity founded on some intermediate change in conditions. Bleckley v. Bleckley, 189 Ga. 47, 5 S.E.2d 206 (1939); Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 200 Ga. 693, 38 S.E.2d 534 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>And in determining whether there has been laches, there are various things to be considered,</b> notably the duration of the delay in asserting the claim, and the sufficiency of the excuse offered in extenuation of the delay, whether plaintiff acquiesced in the assertion or operation of the corresponding adverse claim, the character of the evidence by which plaintiff's right is sought to be established, whether during the delay the evidence of the matters in dispute has been lost or become obscured or the conditions have so changed as to render the enforcement of the right inequitable, whether third persons have acquired intervening rights.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delay in bringing suit must not be such as to preclude the court from arriving at a safe conclusion</b> as to the truth of the matters in controversy, and thus make the doing of equity either doubtful or impossible, due to loss or obscuration of evidence of the transaction in issue, or where the lapse of time has been sufficient to create or justify a presumption that, if the plaintiff was ever possessed of a right, it had been abandoned, waived, or satisfied. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Ellis, 171 Ga. 717, 156 S.E. 603 (1931); Flemister v. Billups, 202 Ga. 132, 42 S.E.2d 376 (1947); Welch v.

<p class="p4">While most frequently the bar of laches is applied in instances where the long delay has rendered the ascertainment of the truth difficult, the doctrine does not rest on that premise alone. Johnson v. Sears, 199 Ga. 432, 34 S.E.2d 541 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An unreasonable delay until the death of essential witnesses, which practically precludes the court from arriving at a safe conclusion as to the truth of the matters in controversy, and which make the doing of equity either doubtful or impossible, due to loss or obscuration of evidence of the transaction in issue, will bar the action.

<p class="p4"><b>Laches does not arise from mere lapse of time.</b> Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dempsey, 120 Ga. App. 5, 169 S.E.2d 349 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And in fixing the time when the bar of laches may be interposed, the court does not measure altogether by the lapse of time,</b> because this section declares that: "Equity gives no relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of the truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the right." Bass v. Mayor of Milledgeville, 180 Ga. 156, 178 S.E. 529 (1934), appeal dismissed, 295 U.S. 721, 55 S. Ct. 926, 79 L. Ed. 1675 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Laches is an equitable doctrine which is independent of the statute of limitations,</b> and as to the lapse of time necessary for invoking the doctrine of laches, such time may or may not correspond with the time specified in the statute of limitations. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Sailors, 69 Ga. App. 628, 26 S.E.2d 557 (1943); Johnson v. Sears, 199 Ga. 432, 34 S.E.2d 541 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>But courts of equity may act in obedience and analogy to statutes of limitation.</b> - While the equitable doctrine of laches operates independently of any statute of limitations, courts of equity usually act in obedience and in analogy to the statutes of limitations, in cases where it would not be unjust and inequitable to do so. Cooper v. Aycock, 199 Ga. 658, 34 S.E.2d 895 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Lapse of time is an important element of laches; yet, unless a case falls within the operation of a statute of limitations, there is no fixed period within which a person must assert his claim or be barred by laches; the length of time depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Cooper v. Aycock, 199 Ga. 658, 34 S.E.2d 895 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The period from which laches is determined is fixed in equity cases according to the circumstances of each case.</b> Bryan v. Willingham-Little Stone Co., 194 Ga. 563, 22 S.E.2d 40 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The doctrine of laches not only forbids relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the right, but also authorizes equity to interpose an equitable bar, whenever, from the lapse of time and laches of the complainant, it would be inequitable to allow a party to enforce his legal rights. Goodwin v. First Baptist Church, 225 Ga. 448, 169 S.E.2d 334 (1969), later appeal, 226 Ga. 524, 175 S.E.2d 868 (1970). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an equitable suit to obtain possession of lands, under a rule analogous to the rule of law permitting title by adverse possession to be acquired in seven years under color of title, claimants would be barred after such time by their laches. Slade v. Barber, 200 Ga. 405, 37 S.E.2d 143 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On an equitable petition seeking merely a cancellation of a deed, although "equity follows the analogy of the law" in allowing the seven-year period of limitation, this time is permitted only if there are no special circumstances demanding an earlier application, and where such circumstances exist, calling for an interposition of the equitable doctrine of laches, equity will refuse relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of the truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the right. Stephens v. Walker, 193 Ga. 330, 18 S.E.2d 537 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The rules of limitation do not apply if the defendant, or those under whom he claims, has been guilty of a fraud by which the plaintiff shall have been debarred or deterred from his action. In such a case the period of limitation shall run only from the time of the discovery of the fraud, and equity applies a similar rule as to laches. Stephens v. Walker, 193 Ga. 330, 18 S.E.2d 537 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The statute of limitations is a statute of repose. When a person is defrauded, and has knowledge of the fraud, he must ask redress,</b> if at all, within the period of limitation. If he waits for a longer period, he is bound by his laches. Slade v. Barber, 200 Ga. 405, 37 S.E.2d 143 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fraud, which should have been discovered if usual and reasonable diligence had been exercised, is not a good reply to the statute of limitations. Slade v. Barber, 200 Ga. 405, 37 S.E.2d 143 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A general allegation of fraud amounts to nothing.</b> - It is necessary that the complainant show, by specifications, wherein the fraud consists in order to prevent the application of laches against him. Issuable facts must be charged. Welch v. Welch, 215 Ga. 198, 109 S.E.2d 757 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Measure of delay.</b> - Period of the delay in bringing suit to decide if it is barred by laches is measured from the time the cause of action was possessed by the party charged with laches or his privies. Chapman v. McClelland, 248 Ga. 725, 286 S.E.2d 290 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pleading and Practice</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defense of laches must be alleged.</b> - A petition is not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the ground of laches on the part of the petitioner, where nothing in the petition authorizes the inference that there was any delay on the petitioner's part, suit being brought within the statute of limitations, which rendered the ascertainment of the truth more difficult, or in any way hindered the defendant city in making its defense. Vickers v. City of Fitzgerald, 216 Ga. 476, 117 S.E.2d 316 (1960), overruled on other grounds, City of Chamblee v. Maxwell, 264 Ga. 635, 452 S.E.2d 488 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Laches is an equitable defense, and a petition for equitable relief is not subject to demurrer (now motion to dismiss) on the ground of laches unless the allegations of fact affirmatively show such defense. Henderson v. Henderson, 219 Ga. 310, 133 S.E.2d 251 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And plaintiff must prove absence of laches.</b> - Where the petition affirmatively shows that there has been unusual and unreasonable delay in bringing the action, it is incumbent upon the plaintiffs to show that they were not guilty of laches. Hillis v. Clark, 222 Ga. 604, 150 S.E.2d 922 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is incumbent on the plaintiff, in order to repel the presumption of unreasonable delay, to allege in his petition the impediments to an earlier prosecution of his claim. Parker v. Fisher, 207 Ga. 3, 59 S.E.2d 715 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where it cannot be said as a matter of law that the plaintiff was dilatory in asserting his claim, then the defense of laches is a question for the jury and summary judgment cannot be granted the defendant on the issue. Davidson Mineral Properties, Inc. v. Gifford-Hill &amp; Co., 235 Ga. 176, 219 S.E.2d 133 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application to mandamus.</b> - Supreme Court of Georgia concluded that case law supporting that a mandamus action can be barred by gross laches is the correct rule; thus, Crow v. McCallum, 215 Ga. 692, 696 (113 S.E. 203) (1960), and its progeny, were wrongly decided and overruled. Marsh v. Clarke County Sch. Dist., 292 Ga. 28, 732 S.E.2d 443 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A plaintiff's right to recover his share of the remainder estate is a plain statutory right not subject to the bar of laches.</b> Perkins v. First Nat'l Bank, 221 Ga. 82, 143 S.E.2d 474 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One in possession of land is not chargeable with laches in failing to bring suit to cancel deeds.</b> Marietta Realty &amp; Dev. Co. v. Reynolds, 189 Ga. 147, 5 S.E.2d 347 (1939); Davis v. Newton, 217 Ga. 75, 121 S.E.2d 153 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One who is in possession of property under a claim of ownership will not be guilty of laches for delay in resorting to a court of equity to establish his rights.</b> Davis v. Newton, 215 Ga. 58, 108 S.E.2d 809 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Affirmative defense relevant.</b> - Trial court's denial of a decedent's father's motion for partial summary judgment pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56 in an action against the decedent's mother and the estate administrator was proper, because the defense of laches under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-1-25 was appropriate in defense of the father's request for imposition of a constructive trust on an annuity that was purchased with the wrongful death settlement proceeds, and the defense of advice of counsel under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-19-17 against the father's claim of breach of fiduciary duty was relevant to the mother's state of mind.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Before equity will interfere to grant relief against a judgment at law, three things must concur:</b> ignorance of the defense sought to be set up at the time the judgment at law was rendered, without negligence being imputable to the complainant, and a want of adequate relief at law. Beddingfield v. Old Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 175 Ga. 172, 165 S.E. 61 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>There is no relief from a judgment that could have been prevented but for the negligence of the party.</b> Beddingfield v. Old Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 175 Ga. 172, 165 S.E. 61 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity will not reward negligence.</b> - Where a defendant in a pending lawsuit negligently fails to make his defense, equity will not intervene to grant him any relief from a judgment obtained against him in consequence of his negligence. West v. Downer, 218 Ga. 235, 127 S.E.2d 359 (1962); Stratton v. Bingham, 238 Ga. 287, 232 S.E.2d 560 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a party moving to set aside a judgment, during the term it was rendered, has been legally served with the suit and does not show that an alleged fraud practiced on him by the defendant prevented him from making his defense and having his day in court, it is beyond a court's power to grant the motion. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity will not intervene to set aside a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, which might have been prevented except for the negligence of the complaining party. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Seagraves, 178 Ga. 459, 173 S.E. 167 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a party has a good defense at law, and from negligence fails to set it up at the proper time, he must take the consequences of his own laches; he cannot go into equity to be relieved from the consequences of such negligence. Peacock v. Walker, 213 Ga. 628, 100 S.E.2d 575 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The judgment probating a will in solemn form cannot be set aside on any ground which by due diligence could have been ascertained and pleaded as a defense against probate. Smith v. Smith, 225 Ga. 799, 171 S.E.2d 524 (1969). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As qualification of the rule controlling the setting aside of judgments or prerequisites to its exercise it must appear that it was not due to defendant's negligence that the fraud was perpetrated, and that due diligence would not have prevented the fraud. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961), later appeal, 106 Ga. App. 652, 127 S.E.2d 859 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To authorize setting aside a judgment after the term at which it was rendered, the actions of the adverse party that cause a party's failure to appear and defend must be of such character to show that reliance on them did not amount to laches or negligence. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961), later appeal, 106 Ga. App. 652, 127 S.E.2d 859 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The failure of a defendant to attend and defend a suit against him cannot be relieved in equity upon the ground that he was advised by his attorney that the case would not be tried until a later term, where it is merely shown that such advice was based upon an incorrect and unwarranted assumption that the remainder of the term would be devoted to the trial of criminal cases. In such a case the erroneous assumption on the part of the attorney would be imputable to the client, and would afford no equitable ground for excusing his absence. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Seagraves, 178 Ga. 459, 173 S.E. 167 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where an administrator was sued upon an instrument alleged to have been executed by his intestate, and he did not know the instrument to be genuine, he should have exercised diligence to determine this fact before permitting judgment against him, and, where he knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the instrument would be introduced in evidence at the trial upon another defense which he had filed, when he would have a sufficient opportunity to discover the truth as to its genuineness, and he failed to avail himself of this opportunity and was absent from the trial only because of an unwarranted assumption by his attorney as to the time when the case would be tried, with the result that judgment was rendered against him, he cannot obtain the aid of a court of equity to set aside the judgment upon the ground that the instrument was a forgery and that he was ignorant of this defense at the time the judgment was rendered. In such case the failure to discover the defense before judgment cannot be accounted as an accident or misfortune, but is chargeable to the defendant as negligence, barring any claim for relief in equity. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Seagraves, 178 Ga. 459, 173 S.E. 167 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a wife voluntarily signed an acknowledgment of service and waiver of process with respect to a suit for divorce that was later to be prepared and filed against her by her husband, and after having signed such acknowledgment and waiver, left the state and made no investigation whatever as to the contents of the suit, which, as filed sought not only a divorce but also custody of the minor child of the parties, with judgment rendered accordingly as to both matters in favor of the husband, the wife's petition in equity to set aside the judgment showed such negligence on the part of the wife in failing to acquaint herself with the contents of the suit as to bar her right to equitable relief sought, and the court did not err in dismissing the petition despite the wife's allegation that there was a breach of an agreement by the husband that he would not seek custody in the suit. Bach v. Phillips, 200 Ga. 308, 37 S.E.2d 407 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In order to set aside an award of the full workmen's compensation board (now Board of Workers' Compensation) which was entered pursuant to an agreement between the parties, because of fraud, accident or mistake, this fraud, accident or mistake is the same as is set forth in this section, and is not available where the person seeking to set aside the award has been guilty of fraud or negligence himself. Where an agreement signed by the claimant which is said to have been procured by fraud stated not only that the claimant did not suffer an injury which arose out of and in the course of her employment, but stated that she was not entitled to any compensation, such language being clear and understandable and it is not alleged that the claimant was prohibited from reading such agreement or that she did not read it, therefore, it must be concluded that the claimant was either negligent in failing to read such agreement or that she was negligent in signing it if some part of it was untrue and she had read it. McCord v. Employers Liab. Assurance Corp., 96 Ga. App. 35, 99 S.E.2d 327 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity will not set aside judgment on the ground that a party and his attorney were prevented from attending the court by a statement previously made to them by the justice of the peace that case would not be tried on date actually set, but on the next day absent fraud on the opposite party or his counsel and any meritorious defense against the recovery had by the verdict. Dorsey v. Griffin, 173 Ga. 802, 161 S.E. 601 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Negligent delay in seeking to set judgment aside.</b> - Where the complainants negligently allowed three years to pass without seeking to set aside the judgment complained of at law, equity will not grant them any relief. Field v. Jordan, 124 Ga. 685, 52 S.E. 885 (1906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Where failure to secure witnesses was due to negligence, equity will not grant relief.</b> McCaulis v. Duval, 69 Ga. 744 (1882).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity will not, by injunction, restrain the enforcement of a judgment when the defendant had notice of such judgment</b> within the period of limitations, and negligently failed to take any action to have such judgment vacated or set aside within the time provided by law. Turner v. Avant, 205 Ga. 426, 54 S.E.2d 269 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Fraud generally.</b> - The word fraud in this section may be construed to include duress. Duress is but a species of fraud where one is induced contrary to one's will from presenting a defense to a suit. Frost v. Frost, 235 Ga. 672, 221 S.E.2d 567 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fraud in the procurement of a judgment to be set aside must have been actual and positive, done with knowledge, and not merely constructive fraud, committed in ignorance of the true facts. Rivers v. Alsup, 188 Ga. 75, 2 S.E.2d 632 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Deceitful practices in depriving or endeavoring to deprive another of his known right by means of some artful device or plan contrary to plain rules of common honesty constitute fraud. By this term is meant fraud perpetrated by some artifice or contrivance of the party or person benefited, whereby in the course of the trial, or in entering judgment, the injured party or the court has been imposed upon or betrayed into inattention or deceived. Johnson v. Bogdis, 205 Ga. 535, 54 S.E.2d 620 (1949), later appeal, 207 Ga. 650, 63 S.E.2d 658 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>The judicial power to set aside a judgment for fraud is recognized in this section.</b> Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The power to set aside a judgment for fraud may be exercised by courts having equity jurisdiction when proper grounds are shown. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>A federal district court could set aside for fraud a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court)</b> discharging a guardian. Park v. Park, 37 F. Supp. 185 (N.D. Ga. 1941), later appeal, 123 F.2d 370 (5th Cir. 1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A proceeding to set aside for fraud a judgment of a court of ordinary (now probate court) discharging a guardian is authorized</b> and could be maintained in the superior courts of the State of Georgia, and this without recourse to the court of ordinary which granted the judgment of discharge. Park v. Park, 37 F. Supp. 185 (N.D. Ga. 1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>A party must be vigilant to detect fraud.</b> One who has been negligent and inactive cannot obtain relief. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961), later appeal, 106 Ga. App. 652, 127 S.E.2d 859 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>And fraud must be specifically alleged.</b> - To set aside an award for fraud, it is not sufficient to state the fraud in general terms, but such facts of fraud must be so stated that the court may see the illegality. Tinsley v. Maddox, 176 Ga. 471, 168 S.E. 297 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a party moving to set aside a judgment, during the term it was rendered, has been legally served with the suit and does not show that an alleged fraud practiced on him by the defendant prevented him from making his defense and having his day in court, it is beyond a court's power to grant the motion. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While a court of equity in a proper case will set aside a judgment which is procured by fraud, such fraud must be one other than false and untrue testimony. Hutchings v. Roquemore, 171 Ga. 359, 155 S.E. 675 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">While a court of equity has authority to annul and set aside a judgment obtained by fraud, accident or mistake, it must be made to appear in an action therefor, where fraud is claimed, that the fraud was perpetrated by the adverse party, his counsel or agent. Pike v. Andrews, 210 Ga. 553, 81 S.E.2d 817 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud that will authorize equity to set aside an award is fraud extrinsic or collateral</b> to the matter tried by the first court, and not a fraud which was in issue in that suit; or it must be fraud or deception practiced on the unsuccessful party, by which he was prevented from exhibiting fully his case, and by which there has never been a real contest before court on the subject matter of the suit. Tinsley v. Maddox, 176 Ga. 471, 168 S.E. 297 (1933); Pike v. Andrews, 210 Ga. 553, 81 S.E.2d 817 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">When one party does give the other assurances upon which he can reasonably rely, that the suit will be dismissed or judgment will not be taken, and then procures a judgment taking advantage of the trust and confidence of the other party, the party misled, who is not himself negligent, has a ground to set aside the judgment. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961), later appeal, 106 Ga. App. 652, 127 S.E.2d 859 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A petition in equity seeking to set aside a judgment dismissing petitioner's suit at law on general demurrer (now motion to dismiss), by consent of one of petitioner's attorneys and counsel for defendant, on the ground of false representations made by defendant's counsel to induce petitioner's counsel to consent to the judgment, which failed to allege that petitioner's counsel consented to the judgment in violation of express instructions of which the defendant or her counsel had notice or knowledge, failed to set forth a cause of action for equitable relief, and it was not error to dismiss the petition on general demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Pike v. Andrews, 210 Ga. 553, 81 S.E.2d 817 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of fraud perpetrated by third-party stranger.</b> - One who has obtained a judgment at law and who is not chargeable with fraud, will not be interfered with by a court of equity for the mere reason that a stranger perpetrated a fraud which prevented the other party to the judgment from interposing a defense. Beddingfield v. Old Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 175 Ga. 172, 165 S.E. 61 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One who has obtained a judgment at law according to the prescribed method, and who is not chargeable with any conduct which would amount to fraud or imposition upon the adverse party in relation to the judgment, will not be interfered with by a court of equity for the mere reason that a stranger perpetrated a fraud which prevented the other party to the judgment from interposing a defense. Pike v. Andrews, 210 Ga. 553, 81 S.E.2d 817 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The mere failure of a party to disclose to the court or to his adversary matters which would defeat his own claim</b> or defense is not such fraud as will justify or require a vacation of the judgment. Buice v. T. &amp; B. Bldrs., Inc., 219 Ga. 259, 132 S.E.2d 784 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setting aside fraudulent registration of title to land.</b> - In cases of fraud or forgery, the decree registering title in the name of an applicant for registration is not a bar to a proceeding by the true owner to set aside such registration, if he moves in seven years. Rock Run Iron Co. v. Miller, 156 Ga. 136, 118 S.E. 670 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mistake of Fact</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegations of mistake of fact constitute cause of action to set aside judgment.</b> - Where, due to a mistake of fact unmixed with negligence, the condemnation proceeding for a public road was conducted throughout upon the theory that the road would be paved at approximately grade level, thus improving rather than damaging the remaining abutting property, and there was nothing to indicate that a fill of from 25 to 40 feet would be made in front of the remaining property which would damage it in the amount of approximately $20,000.00, a petition in equity, alleging these facts and alleging that the mistake prevented the owners from proving this consequential damage, alleged a cause of action to set aside the award and the judgment of condemnation and to recover the full damages. Whipple v. County of Houston, 214 Ga. 532, 105 S.E.2d 898 (1958).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of disqualified jurors,</b> due to the fact that they failed to report their relationship to plaintiff, amounts to such a mistake as will authorize a court of equity to set aside the verdict rendered in the law court and order a new trial. Gulf Ref. Co. v. Miller, 151 Ga. 721, 108 S.E. 25 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegations of duress as acceptable basis to set judgment aside.</b> - A party who has been prevented by duress from defending a suit against him may be relieved from the judgment. Hirsch v. Collier, 104 Ga. App. 271, 121 S.E.2d 318 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ignorance Generally</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ignorance insufficient as basis to set judgment aside.</b> - A person who, through ignorance, allows a judgment to go against him, cannot afterwards have it set aside, even on the ground of fraud, if he himself has not exercised ordinary diligence in the premises. Hoke v. Walraven, 57 Ga. App. 106, 194 S.E. 610 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A court will not relieve against a judgment at law, unless the defendant in the judgment can show he had a good defense of which he was entirely ignorant while the suit at law was pending against him; or unless he was prevented from availing himself of his defense, by fraud, or accident, or the act of the adverse party, unmixed with negligence, or fault on his part. Felker v. Johnson, 189 Ga. 797, 7 S.E.2d 668 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A judgment will not be set aside in a court of equity on the ground that the defendant had a good defense of which he was entirely ignorant, unless it appears that his ignorance of such defense and his failure to assert it were unmixed with any fault or negligence on his part. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Seagraves, 178 Ga. 459, 173 S.E. 167 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to Present Meritorious Defense</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presentation of meritorious defense required.</b> - Where petition fails to allege that petitioner had filed a meritorious defense to the case in which judgment was rendered against him in the justice court, a court will not interfere to set aside such judgment. Dorsey v. Griffin, 173 Ga. 802, 161 S.E. 601 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where no defense was offered, equity will not grant relief.</b> Cohen v. Meador, 137 Ga. 551, 73 S.E. 749 (1912); Garrett v. Thornton, 157 Ga. 487, 121 S.E. 820 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

McAfee, 101 Ga. 701, 29 S.E. 428 (1897); Graham v. Graham, 137 Ga. 668, 74 S.E. 426 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Two things are required to constitute a meritorious bill in equity to set aside a judgment</b> rendered in a court having jurisdiction on account of accident, mistake or fraud: first, that the complainant had a good defense to the action at law; and secondly, that the failure to make that defense there was owing, not to any negligence or fault in the complainant, but to fault of the defendants or their attorney. Russell v. Hoge, 217 Ga. 814, 125 S.E.2d 648 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In equitable proceedings to set aside a judgment rendered in a court of law on account of accident, mistake, or fraud, the plaintiff is required to set out a meritorious defense to the action in which he seeks to set aside the judgment. This does not mean that, in a direct equitable proceeding to set aside a judgment of a court of ordinary or a court of law on the ground that such court or courts had no jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the person, and that said judgment is void, it is necessary to plead a meritorious defense. Foster v. Foster, 207 Ga. 519, 63 S.E.2d 318 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>But mere failure to make a defense affords no grounds to set aside an award.</b> Tinsley v. Maddox, 176 Ga. 471, 168 S.E. 297 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A judgment obtained against an executor cannot be set aside in equity by legatees on ground that there was a good defense which executor failed to set up, unless it be also shown that there was accident, mistake, fraud, or corrupt complicity between executor and plaintiff. Tinsley v. Maddox, 176 Ga. 471, 168 S.E. 297 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To have a judgment set aside, a plaintiff must have a good defense of which he was entirely ignorant, or he must be prevented from making the defense because of fraud or accident, or the act of the adverse party, unmixed with fraud or negligence on his own part. The allegation that the plaintiff had no notice that he was being sued is not sufficient ground to set aside the judgment, the opposite party having complied with the law as to service. Milam v. Busey, 96 Ga. App. 88, 99 S.E.2d 325 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to plead equitable defense in city court.</b> - A judgment of a city court will not be set aside merely because the defendant failed to plead his equitable defenses thereto.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of section.</b> - Before it is applicable, this section requires great inadequacy of consideration joined with great disparity of mental ability. It follows, therefore, that both must exist. Bailey v. Williams, 215 Ga. 395, 110 S.E.2d 673 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Want of consideration for a conveyance, coupled with mental weakness or old age and undue influence, will authorize equitable relief</b> under this section. Harden v. Weaver, 184 Ga. 652, 192 S.E. 384 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"Great inadequacy of consideration, joined with great disparity of mental ability in contracting a bargain, may justify equity in setting aside a sale or other contract." Under that principle, a deed may be set aside in equity, on proof of the two elements stated, "without proof of anything else" as to fraud. A fortiori, the same rule would apply with at least equal force in case of such mental disparity and a total absence of consideration. Stow v. Hargrove, 203 Ga. 735, 48 S.E.2d 454 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conflict as to issue of disparate mental ability.</b> - Where, in a wrongful death action, a railroad argued there was no evidence presented to show a disparate mental ability between anyone representing the railroad on the one hand and the plaintiffs on the other at the time of their signing of a contract of release, but plaintiffs showed that they were in a highly emotional state following the death of their son and that treatment for their stress included valium, and a psychologist, who tested the plaintiffs found their I.Q. levels to be in the "mentally defective" range, while the railroad agent involved, on the other hand, was college educated and had some 20 years' experience in claims investigation and settlement, under the "any evidence" standard, the railroad was not entitled to a directed verdict. Southern Ry. v. Lawson, 256 Ga. 798, 353 S.E.2d 491 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>2. Fraud</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud in the procurement renders contract void.</b> - As between the original parties thereto, fraud in its procurement voids a contract, and this upon the theory that, the consent of the parties being necessary to the binding force of a contract, if one, apparently consenting by the execution of a written contract, can show that he did not in fact consent to its terms as therein expressed, but that his apparent consent was induced by false and fraudulent practices, by means of which he was overreached by the other party, and, without negligence upon his own part, really deceived as to the terms of the contract, he would be entitled to be relieved from its apparent obligations. McKaig v. Hardy, 196 Ga. 582, 27 S.E.2d 11 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the grantor of an "improvident or profuse" deed was not wholly incapable of entering into such a contract, but was possessed of little or no will power and was greatly under the influence of the nephew to whom the deed was executed, an inference of fraud could have been drawn by the jury, and, the evidence for the defendant grantee not being such as to rebut the inference as a matter of law, the court was authorized to charge the jury upon the subject of fraud. Stanley v. Stanley, 175 Ga. 139, 175 S.E. 496 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As against one who by fraud during the lifetime of deceased husband induced the latter to execute to him a deed to realty, equity will afford the widow, as personal representative, a remedy to cancel and set aside the deed and incidentally to preserve and apply rents issuing from such realty. Ealy v. Tolbert, 209 Ga. 575, 74 S.E.2d 867, later appeal, 210 Ga. 96, 78 S.E.2d 26 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>3. Insanity</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where the maker is insane and the other party sane, there would be great mental disparity.</b> The law however, presumes one to be sane. Norwood v. Norwood, 207 Ga. 148, 60 S.E.2d 449 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>4. Weakness of Mind</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Weakness of mind not amounting to imbecility insufficient mental incapacity to justify setting deed aside.</b> - The law recognizes that there is "some disparity of mental ability between all persons who deal with each other," and "weakness of mind not amounting to imbecility is not sufficient mental incapacity to justify setting a deed aside." Bailey v. Williams, 215 Ga. 395, 110 S.E.2d 673 (1959); Thomas v. Garrett, 265 Ga. 395, 456 S.E.2d 573 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>5. Grief</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statement that person was "almost crazy with grief".</b> - In action for cancellation or rescission of deed, the mere statement that the plaintiff was "almost crazy with grief over the recent death of her son" shows neither a mental incapacity to execute the instrument nor a "great disparity of mental ability" between the parties, such as would authorize the interference of equity on account of a "great inadequacy" of consideration, even if a "great inadequacy" had been sufficiently alleged. Hutchinson v. King, 192 Ga. 402, 15 S.E.2d 523 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Will executed within days of spouse's death.</b> - Trial court did not err in charging the jury under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-2 in a suit by an 83-year old plaintiff to recover property from defendants, her brother-in-law and his wife, because the evidence showed that defendants took plaintiff to her bank and to a lawyer 10 days after her husband died, where she deeded her entire estate to them. Mullis v. Mullis, 245 Ga. App. 845, 539 S.E.2d 189 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>6. Intoxication</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where a party at the time of entering into a contract or executing an instrument is intoxicated</b> to such a degree as to deprive him of his reason and to disqualify his mind to apprehend the nature of his act and its probable consequences, a court of equity may grant relief by rescission and cancellation. Equity will grant relief where the transfer of a valuable property has been fraudulently extorted, for a grossly inadequate consideration, from a person while in such a state of intoxication as to render him incapable of transacting business. McKaig v. Hardy, 196 Ga. 582, 27 S.E.2d 11 (1943); Ealy v. Tolbert, 209 Ga. 575, 74 S.E.2d 867, later appeal, 210 Ga. 96, 78 S.E.2d 26 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of confidential relationships raises presumption of undue influence.</b> - Where evidence is presented of a confidential relationship, the grantor being of weaker mentality and the grantee occupying the dominant position, an issue of fact is raised as to undue influence. Fletcher v. Fletcher, 242 Ga. 158, 249 S.E.2d 530 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge to jury.</b> - Where the sole question was whether the transaction was an outright sale or a loan of money, and not a question of one party overreaching the other party the court did not err in not charging this section with respect to great inadequacy of consideration and great disparity of mental ability between the contracting parties.

<p class="p4">In an action to set aside a deed, an instruction that the jury might set aside a deed if it found the mental ability of one party merely less than the mental ability of the person with whom he or she was being compared was erroneous and, further, the giving of the charge was error because there was no evidence to warrant it.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A mistake, either of law or fact, is cognizable in equity and affords a remedy therein by reformation</b> of the instrument so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, on a proper cause being made; but such a jurisdiction will always be cautiously exercised, and to justify it the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive. Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 200 Ga. 693, 38 S.E.2d 534 (1946); Prince v. Friedman, 202 Ga. 136, 42 S.E.2d 434 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Reformation as applied to a contract is remedy cognizable in equity for the purpose of correcting an instrument so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, where from some cause, such as fraud, accident, or mistake it does not express such intention. The remedy is not available for the purpose of making a new and different contract for the parties, but is confined to establishment of the actual agreement. Deck v. Shields, 195 Ga. 697, 25 S.E.2d 514 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The power in equity to relieve mistakes should be exercised with caution, and the evidence shall be clear, unequivocal and decisive as to the mistake. Thomaston v. Fort Wayne Pools, Inc., 181 Ga. App. 541, 352 S.E.2d 794 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistake defined.</b> - Mistake, within the meaning of equity, is an erroneous mental condition, conception, or conviction, induced by ignorance, misapprehension, or misunderstanding of the truth, but without negligence and resulting in some act or omission done or suffered erroneously by one or both of the parties to a transaction, but without its erroneous character being intended or known at the time. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 184 Ga. 87, 190 S.E. 831 (1937); Whipple v. County of Houston, 214 Ga. 532, 105 S.E.2d 898 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Mistake is internal; it is a mental condition, a conception, a conviction of the understanding; erroneous indeed, but nonetheless a conviction which influences the will and leads to some outward physical manifestation. Its operation is ordinarily, though not always, affirmative the doing of some act which would not have been done in the absence of the particular conception or conviction which influenced the free action of the will. Its essential requisite is ignorance. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 184 Ga. 87, 190 S.E. 831 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The essential element of a mistake is a mental condition or conception or conviction of the understanding. This mental condition may be either a passive state or an active conviction. When merely passive, it may consist of an unconsciousness, an ignorance, or a forgetfulness; when active, it must be a belief. In the first of these two conditions, the unconsciousness, ignorance, or forgetfulness may be either of a fact which is present and now existing, or of a fact which is past and has existed; they must always concern a fact material to the transaction. In the second condition, the belief may be either that a certain matter or thing exists at the present time which really does not exist; or that certain matter or thing existed at some time which did not really exist. All possible forms of mistake of fact are embraced within this description; and all particular errors which fall under any of these conditions are mistakes of fact which furnish an occasion for equitable relief. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 184 Ga. 87, 190 S.E. 831 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistake of fact is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake,</b> and consisting in, an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract; or belief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract which does not exist, or in the past existence of such a thing which has not existed. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 184 Ga. 87, 190 S.E. 831 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistake is distinguished from fraud, fraudulent representations, or fraudulent concealments,</b> by the absence of knowledge and intention, which in legal fraud are actually present, and in constructive fraud are theoretically present, as necessary elements. It is also distinguished from that inattention or absence of thought which are inherent in negligence. The erroneous conception or conviction of the understanding which constitutes the equitable notion of mistake has nothing in common with negligence; equity will not relieve a person from his erroneous acts or omissions resulting from his own negligence. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 184 Ga. 87, 190 S.E. 831 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question of fact as to whether reformation warranted.</b> - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the borrowers on the bank's claim for equitable reformation of the security deeds because evidence included the fact that a portion of the 2003 loan paid off a joint debt previously secured by the property and the borrowers subsequently represented to the bankruptcy court that the debt secured by the property was jointly owed, which created a question of fact as to whether the debt was secured by the real property at issue. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Cuneo, 332 Ga. App. 73, 770 S.E.2d 48 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reformation of lease agreement denied.</b> - In an action seeking reformation of a lease agreement to include an option to purchase, the trial court properly granted the defendant's motion for directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff's evidence, where there was no evidence of mutual mistake, there was likewise no evidence of fraud or inequitable conduct in the record, it was undisputed that plaintiff did not read the lease agreement until months after he signed it, and the record did not demonstrate that a confidential relationship existed between the parties, but rather showed that they were friends engaged in an arms' length transaction.

<p class="p4"><b>No mutual mistake because contract addressed disputed subject.</b> - Parties to a business buyout agreement failed to show mutual mistake regarding the validity of a proposed lease assignment because the parties specifically contemplated that the original office building lease or assignment might have to be changed, that the assignment might never occur even with the best efforts of the parties, and that any risk in that regard would be assumed by the buying parties.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity will not reform a contract on the ground of mistake,</b> unless it be a mutual one or unless there be a mistake on one side and fraud on the other. Rawson v. Brosnan, 187 Ga. 624, 1 S.E.2d 423 (1939); Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 200 Ga. 693, 38 S.E.2d 534 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity will not decree the reformation of an instrument because of mistake of one of the parties alone unmixed with any fraud or knowledge on the part of the other equivalent to mutual mistake. For a mistake to be relievable in equity by reformation, it must be mutual, or else mistake on the part of one to the contract and fraud on the part of the other. Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 200 Ga. 693, 38 S.E.2d 534 (1946); Prince v. Friedman, 202 Ga. 136, 42 S.E.2d 434 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A court of equity will reform a contract of sale when, from mutual mistake or mistake common to both parties, an instrument does not express the true agreement of the parties. Equity will also reform an instrument where there is mistake on one side, and fraud or inequitable conduct on the other. Prince v. Friedman, 202 Ga. 136, 42 S.E.2d 434 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To enable a court to reform an agreement evidenced by writing on the ground of mistake, it must affirmatively appear that the mistake was common to both parties, and that the writing, as executed, expresses the contract as understood by both parties. Prince v. Friedman, 202 Ga. 136, 42 S.E.2d 434 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a writing has been executed with a view of obtaining a particular object, and by mistake it has been so drawn as not to have the contemplated operations at law, chancery (now equity) will reform the instrument, so that it will fulfill the intention of the parties. Agreements, whether executed or executory, within or without the statute of frauds, whether for the conveyance of real or personal property, will be reformed by courts of equity, on the ground of mistake. Head v. Stephens, 215 Ga. 184, 109 S.E.2d 772 (1959), later appeal, 218 Ga. 191, 126 S.E.2d 623 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"An honest mistake of the law as to the effect of an instrument on the part of both contracting parties, when such mistake operates as a gross injustice to one, and gives an unconscientious advantage to the other, may be relieved in equity." Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. State Hwy. Dep't, 174 Ga. 443, 163 S.E. 174 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The rule is well settled that a simple mistake by a party as to the legal effect of an agreement which he executes, or as to the legal result of an act which he performs, is no ground for either defensive or affirmative relief. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 184 Ga. 87, 190 S.E. 831 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a defendant has been served and a judgment is rendered against him by fraud, accident, or mistake, without fault or negligence on his part, a petition in equity to set aside the judgment will lie. Dollar v. Fred W. Amend Co., 184 Ga. 432, 191 S.E. 696 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where, due to a mistake of fact unmixed with negligence, the condemnation proceeding for a public road was conducted throughout upon the theory that the road would be paved at approximately grade level, thus improving rather than damaging the remaining abutting property, and there was nothing to indicate that a fill of from 25 to 40 feet would be made in front of the remaining property which would damage it in the amount of approximately $20,000.00, a petition in equity, alleging these facts and alleging that the mistake prevented the owners from proving this consequential damage, alleged a cause of action to set aside the award and the judgment of condemnation and to recover the full damages. Whipple v. County of Houston, 214 Ga. 532, 105 S.E.2d 898 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the plaintiff had opportunity to examine a second written tolling agreement before he executed it, and because there was no suggestion that the alleged mistake in the agreement was anything other than a unilateral mistake on the part of the plaintiff, the plaintiff's own negligence resulted in there being no basis for reforming the parties' second written tolling agreement. Frame v. Hunter, Maclean, Exley &amp; Dunn, P.C., 236 Ga. App. 226, 511 S.E.2d 585 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistake of draftsman acting by direction of only one party as unilateral mistake.</b> - In some jurisdictions it is held that the mistake of a draftsman or scrivener, acting by direction of only one of the parties, is a unilateral mistake, and is one which will not warrant reformation. Such appears to be the rule in this state. Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 200 Ga. 693, 38 S.E.2d 534 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plea of the defendant to action on note given by him to former partner on dissolution of partnership, alleging mutual mistake in calculating the earnings of the business, failed to allege a mistake as contemplated by law, and the court did not err in dismissing the plea and in directing the verdict for the plaintiff. Hargrove v. Bledsoe, 78 Ga. App. 107, 50 S.E.2d 223 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Wrong property foreclosed upon.</b> - Because a mutual mistake of law was not a valid reason to nullify the parties' choice of Delaware law in order to uphold a right of first refusal, the parties' settlement agreement was not subject to reformation due to an alleged mutual mistake. Thus, under Delaware law, the right was properly declared invalid under the rule against perpetuities. CS-Lakeview at Gwinnett, Inc. v. Simon Prop. Group, Inc., 283 Ga. 426, 659 S.E.2d 359 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly reformed security deed and declared that suing lender had first priority over certain tract of land since there was no doubt that parties intended for the tract to have been subject to the security deed alone; trial court also properly directed verdict in favor of suing lender as to its claim for rescission and cancellation of the deed it obtained when it mistakenly foreclosed on the wrong tract, as such relief was the proper remedy. DeGolyer v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 291 Ga. App. 444, 662 S.E.2d 141 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No specific mutual mistake alleged.</b> - Plaintiff's claim for reformation of a settlement agreement failed since the claim did not allege fraud by the defendants and did not identify any specific mutual mistake. Rohrig Invs., LP v. Knuckle P'ship, LLLP (In re Rohrig Invs., LP), 584 Bankr. 382 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reformation of a bond was warranted based on mutual mistake.</b> - Reformation of a bond was warranted based on mutual mistake since it was clear that a bank of which a bankruptcy debtor was the parent company was intended to be a named insured under the bond which named only the debtor as an insured; the bank was a named insured on a prior bond which the current bond was intended to replace, the bank was a named insured on the bond application, and the bank paid the bond premium. Lubin v. Cincinnati Ins. Co.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment improper if questions of fact remained regarding whether quitclaim deed was contrary to parties' agreement.</b> - Trial court erred in granting a son's motion for summary judgment as to a parent's counterclaim seeking to eject the son from a home and to have a quitclaim deed rescinded or reformed because material questions of fact remained regarding whether the terms of the quitclaim deed were, by mutual mistake, contrary to the agreement of the parties; the parent's deposition testimony could reasonably be construed to signify that the parent expressed the parent's willingness to convey the property only if the parent retained a life estate and that the son accepted the conveyance subject to that condition. Hall v. Hall, 303 Ga. App. 434, 693 S.E.2d 624 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Ignorance of fact will not justify the recission of a contract.</b> Prince v. Friedman, 202 Ga. 136, 42 S.E.2d 434 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reasonable Diligence</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasonable diligence of complainant required.</b> - Equity will relieve against mutual mistake, but only at the instance of a complainant who moves with reasonable diligence. What is a reasonable time must necessarily depend upon the peculiar facts and environments of the particular case. Parker v. Fisher, 207 Ga. 3, 59 S.E.2d 715 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity will grant no relief to one who by the exercise of ordinary diligence, could have prevented the injury</b> complained of. Prince v. Friedman, 202 Ga. 136, 42 S.E.2d 434 (1947); Barham v. United States, 715 F. Supp. 1091 (M.D. Ga. 1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure of insured to read policy insufficient as proof of lack of ordinary diligence.</b> - A mere failure of an insured to read his policy of insurance does not amount to such laches as will debar him from having such policy reformed for mistake therein. A policy of insurance is issued by the insurer and signed by him or his agent. It is not contemplated that the insured shall sign it. In the insurer's promise to deliver an accurate policy, according to his oral agreement with the insured, the insured has a just expectation that there will be no designed variance. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, 242 Ga. 176, 249 S.E.2d 588 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pleading and Practice</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grounds of mistake must be fully alleged.</b> - When a defendant, in a court of law, seeks to avoid his contract on the ground of mistake, he must, by his pleadings, allege the grounds of the mistake, as fully as he is required to do in a court of equity to entitle him to relief. Hargrove v. Bledsoe, 78 Ga. App. 107, 50 S.E.2d 223 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The rules of pleading in this state require that allegations of mistake should be set forth with considerable definiteness and certainty,</b> and that such general allegations as that certain matters were left out of or included in the contract as written "by mutual mistake of the parties" are not sufficient. Wheeler v. Poole, 204 Ga. 477, 50 S.E.2d 326 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And evidence of mistake must be clear, unequivocal and decisive.</b> - To authorize a verdict reforming a deed upon the ground of mutual mistake, the evidence, like the petition, should at least by inference show the particular mistake and illustrate how it occurred; and the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive as to the mistake. Helton v. Shellnut, 186 Ga. 185, 197 S.E. 287 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the court did charge in language identical to that of this section, it is not subject to the criticism that it erred in its charge to the jury that they must decide the question of mistake by a preponderance of the testimony, whereas the law provides that the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive as to the mistake. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. State Hwy. Dep't, 174 Ga. 443, 163 S.E. 174 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It was error for the court to instruct the jury that the party seeking reformation of the description in a deed could establish his right thereto by a preponderance of the evidence only. Carroll v. Craig, 214 Ga. 257, 104 S.E.2d 215 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a diversity based suit in equity to set aside or deny res judicata effect to a prior state court judgment on the grounds of fraud and mutual mistake, the plaintiffs had to prove their claims by something more than a mere preponderance of the evidence. The evidence had to preponderate in the plaintiffs' favor, but it also had to be of "clear, unequivocal, and decisive" quality. Ahrens v. Katz, 595 F. Supp. 1108 (N.D. Ga. 1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action seeking cancellation of a warranty deed to a trustee, the beneficiary's testimony that he could not remember the execution of the deed did not demand a finding that the deed should be cancelled on the ground of legal mistake. Ivey v. Ivey, 266 Ga. 143, 465 S.E.2d 434 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court would not construe an agreement and a deed together as creating a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent because a month-long gap between the execution of the agreement and the deed was too great of a gap in time to deem the documents as being executed contemporaneously. Nor would the court reform the documents to do so as the creditor failed to demonstrate a mistake of present or past fact relievable in equity, either by rescission or reformation. Kelley v. McCormack (In re Mitchell), 548 Bankr. 862 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence.</b> - Before decreeing reformation, a court requires that the parol evidence of a mistake and of an alleged modification of a contract must be most clear and convincing. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, 242 Ga. 176, 249 S.E.2d 588 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit for reformation of contract based upon alleged mutual mistake, the parol evidence rule does not bar introduction of testimony as to the oral agreement reached by the parties which the writing was intended to reflect. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, 242 Ga. 176, 249 S.E.2d 588 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where petition alleges that parties to a deed orally agreed that the consideration was to be $850.00 cash for the plaintiff's equity and that the defendants were to assume and pay certain loans on the property, and that, due to a mutual mistake of law as to the effect of a recital of a nominal consideration in a deed, the deed fails to state the true consideration agreed upon by the parties, the fact that the agreement is not in writing will not bar a recovery, since what is sought to be enforced is not an oral agreement barred by the statute of frauds, but to reduce to writing the true agreement between the parties to prevent an unconscionable advantage to one of the parties to a contract. Head v. Stephens, 215 Ga. 184, 109 S.E.2d 772 (1959), later appeal, 218 Ga. 191, 126 S.E.2d 623 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Relief of mistake of fact generally.</b> - Although equity will not reform a written contract because of mistake as to the contents of the writing on the part of the complaining party, who is able to read but fails to do so, where no sufficient excuse appears as to why such party did not read the contract, such principle has not been extended to cases in which it is sought to reform written instruments on the ground of mutual mistake of fact.

<p class="p4">Even where money is paid under a mistake of fact or in ignorance of facts, it cannot be recovered, unless the circumstances are such that the party receiving it ought not, in equity and good conscience, to be allowed to retain it. The expression, "in equity and good conscience," refers only to the acts and intentions of the person receiving the money as affecting the other party to the transaction. If he has acted in good faith and in good conscience with the person paying the money, he is entitled to retain it, even if his actions and intentions may not have been in good faith and in good conscience as regards other persons not connected with the transaction.

<p class="p4">Where a petition is brought by assignee for reformation of a written lease and option agreement, alleging a valuable consideration, and that permanent improvements had been made on the property involved, and that an alleged inadequate description of the property had been made by mistake of the scrivener, it having been the intention of the parties that the description contended for be inserted in the agreement, and further alleging that unless so reformed an unconscionable advantage would be acquired by the defendant, such allegations state a case for reformation of the lease and option agreement. Martin v. Oakhurst Dev. Corp., 197 Ga. 288, 29 S.E.2d 179 (1944). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Wrong property foreclosed upon.</b> - Trial court properly reformed security deed and declared that suing lender had first priority over certain tract of land since there was no doubt that parties intended for the tract to have been subject to the security deed alone; trial court also properly directed verdict in favor of suing lender as to its claim for rescission and cancellation of the deed it obtained when it mistakenly foreclosed on the wrong tract, as such relief was the proper remedy. DeGolyer v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 291 Ga. App. 444, 662 S.E.2d 141 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judgment creditor had no right to intervene in action for reformation of a deed.</b> - Trial court abused the court's discretion in allowing a borrower's judgment creditor to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-24 in the borrower's action against the lender for reformation of a deed pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-25. The creditor had no interest directly relating to the subject matter of the suit and had other remedies. Potter's Props., LLC v. VNS Corp., 306 Ga. App. 621, 703 S.E.2d 79 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question of fact as to whether reformation warranted.</b> - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the borrowers on the bank's claim for equitable reformation of the security deeds because evidence included the fact that a portion of the 2003 loan paid off a joint debt previously secured by the property and the borrowers subsequently represented to the bankruptcy court that the debt secured by the property was jointly owed, which created a question of fact as to whether the debt was secured by the real property at issue. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Cuneo, 332 Ga. App. 73, 770 S.E.2d 48 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reformation not warranted.</b> - Creditor could not prevail on the creditor's claim for equitable reformation of a security deed executed by a debtor that did not own the property because nothing in the chain of title provided constructive notice to a potential purchaser of the property of the creditor's equitable interest in the property. Stearns Bank, N.A. v. Rent-A-Tent, Inc. (In re Rent A Tent, Inc.), 468 Bankr. 442 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court would not construe an agreement and a deed together as creating a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent because a month-long gap between the execution of the agreement and the deed was too great of a gap in time to deem the documents as being executed contemporaneously. Nor would the court reform the documents to do so as the creditor failed to demonstrate a mistake of present or past fact relievable in equity, either by rescission or reformation. Kelley v. McCormack (In re Mitchell), 548 Bankr. 862 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Taking as true for purposes of a Chapter 7 trustee's motion for judgment on the pleadings a bank's contention that the parties involved in the sale, financing, and purchase of the property at issue intended that the property be conveyed to the debtor wife alone and intended that the security deed encumber the entire property rather than only an undivided one-half interest, the bank was not entitled to reformation of a special warranty deed (SWD) under Georgia law because as a security deed grantee, it was not an original party to the SWD or in privity with any party to the SWD. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Adams (In re Adams), 583 Bankr. 541 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reformation warranted.</b> - Creditor prevailed on the creditor's claim for equitable reformation of a security deed executed by a debtor that did not own the property because a later modification of the deed was filed and was within the chain of title for the property, providing any potential purchaser of the property constructive notice of the creditor's equitable interest in the property. Stearns Bank, N.A. v. Rent-A-Tent, Inc. (In re Rent A Tent, Inc.), 468 Bankr. 442 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Reformation was appropriate under Georgia law as it was clear that both a Chapter 13 debtor and a bank intended the legal description in a security deed to include tract two only, and that a mutual mistake occurred due to a scrivener's error. There was no prejudice to the debtor as the trustee required the debtor to propose a Chapter 13 plan as though the deed had been reformed; further, prejudice due to the loss of debtor's house was not grounds to deny reformation as the debtor contracted and intended to pledge tract two as collateral, the debtor had the use of the loan proceeds, and the debtor used funds to satisfy an earlier debt on the tract. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Thompson (In re Thompson), 499 Bankr. 908 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the bank as to the bank's claim for reformation to include a mistakenly omitted signature on the security deed as the borrowers had not suffered prejudice where the borrowers received a loan and used part of that loan to satisfy an earlier loan from another lender relating to the property, and the borrowers failed to show that the borrowers would suffer any prejudice if the deed were reformed. Vibert v. Bank of America, N.A., 327 Ga. App. 782, 761 S.E.2d 162 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Bankruptcy court did not commit clear error in reforming a security deed and cancelling a quitclaim deed due to the parties' mutual mistake because the undisputed facts showed that the Chapter 13 debtor and the lender intended for the security deed's legal description to include one tract and not three tracts. Thompson v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. (In re Thompson),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(S.D. Ga. Aug. 11, 2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Lenders were entitled to equitable reformation as the evidence demonstrated that the parties had earlier attempted to modify the security deed to include both parcels in the legal description attached to the security deed and to establish both parcels as security for the subject loan.

<p class="p4">Because a mutual mistake of law was not a valid reason to nullify the parties' choice of Delaware law in order to uphold a right of first refusal, the parties' settlement agreement was not subject to reformation due to an alleged mutual mistake.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Elements essential to equitable relief.</b> - Two essential elements must affirmatively appear before a court of equity will be authorized to relieve a purchaser from his bid because of mistake of fact; the exercise of ordinary diligence in discovering the truth, and the fact that the relief will not prejudicially affect the rights of anyone.

<p class="p4"><b>No basis for reformation.</b> - Any possible violation of a fiduciary bond which remained between a city and a law firm as a result of a prior attorney-client relationship provided no basis for reforming an amended lease because there was no indication that the law firm was a party to its attorney's alleged duplicity and there was no proof in the record of any occurrence which prevented the city from reading the amended lease prior to executing the document.

<p class="p4"><b>An insurer was entitled to reformation of a policy</b> where coverage of a vehicle was extended at the insured's request, after the vehicle was involved in an accident; even though the insurer could have inquired before extending the coverage, the insured was not prejudiced by the insurer's action and would obtain a windfall absent reformation of the contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance warranted in foreclosure sale.</b> - Superior court did not err in granting a purchaser summary judgment in the purchaser's action seeking specific performance pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-131 and requiring a mortgage company to deliver a deed conveying certain property because the company failed to demonstrate any merit in the company's contention that the superior court improperly refused to invoke the court's equitable power to relieve the company from performing under the foreclosure sale contract on the ground that the opening bid the company set forth was a mistake. Because the dollar amount of the high bid at the foreclosure sale alone made it immediately apparent that there had been a mistake, a reasonable inference arose that had reasonable diligence been employed before the foreclosure sale, the alleged unilateral mistake would not have occurred.

<p class="p4"><b>Equitable interference not authorized in quiet title action.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a bank and purchasers summary judgment in a son's action to quiet title to a parcel of land because the son did not act with reasonable diligence to verify that a house was located on the land that the son received under a deed, and the purchasers would be prejudiced if the son were granted relief.

<p class="p4">Because there was no fraud that prevented siblings from reading a deed presented to them by their brother, which he allegedly represented as an easement, and no fiduciary relationship upon which they could have justifiably relied, the siblings should have discovered the alleged fraud when they signed the deed, and the seven-year statute of limitations expired seven years later.

<p class="p4">Where one, while negotiating for the purchase of realty, has an opportunity to examine it before agreeing to buy, but fails to do so and voluntarily relies on statements made by the seller concerning its character and value, a written contract to sell and purchase the property subsequently executed by the contracting parties will not, on petition therefor by the purchaser, be rescinded and set aside because of the falsity of such statements, unless some fraud or artifice was practiced by the seller to prevent such examination by the purchaser; and this is true although the purchaser in agreeing to buy relied upon the seller's representations as to the character and value of the property as being true, and in consequence of such reliance acted to his injury. Tingle v. Seignious, 212 Ga. 71, 90 S.E.2d 408 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Any representation, act, or artifice intended to deceive, and which does deceive another, is such a fraud as may authorize cancellation of a written contract, but a party to a contract who can read must read or show a legal excuse for not doing so, and ordinarily, if fraud is the excuse, it must be such fraud as prevents the party from reading; nor in such case will a mere fraudulent statement by the opposite party or his agent as to the contents of the writing furnish a legal excuse. And where the contract is a deed to land, the rule will generally apply to the grantee as well as the grantor. Livingston v. Barnett, 193 Ga. 640, 19 S.E.2d 385 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where two contracting parties deal with each other at arms' length and on equal terms, and where there is no such confidential relation between them as to justify special confidence reposed by one in the other, a written instrument entered into between them cannot be set aside upon the ground that the party seeking to be relieved was induced to enter in and sign the instrument in consequence of fraudulent representations as to its contents upon the part of the adverse party, when it appears that the party signing could read, that there was nothing to prevent him from reading the instrument, but that he did not do so, that there was no sufficient excuse for his failing to do so, but he signed after he had full opportunity to inform himself as to the terms of the instrument by reading it, but negligently omitted to read the same, when he could thus have informed himself of its contents.

<p class="p4">Where plaintiff signed a deed which was read to her by an attorney which she did not read herself, and there was no evidence that there were emergency circumstances of disabilities preventing her from reading the deed, the mere fact that the plaintiff signed the deed in a room where the shades were not put up and the blinds were not open, where it does not appear that she could not have raised the shades nor opened the blinds and let in sufficient light by which she could read the deed, is insufficient as an excuse for her not reading the deed and becoming acquainted with its contents before she signed it. McCommons v. Greene County, 53 Ga. App. 171, 184 S.E. 897 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity will grant no relief in favor of one who buys land when he fails to exercise any diligence for his protection and asserts that he blindly relied on the representations of the seller as to matters of which he could have informed himself, and the same is true in the purchase of a stock of merchandise and fixtures. Holmes v. Walker, 207 Ga. 582, 63 S.E.2d 359 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the inability of a plaintiff vendor, in an alleged fraudulent land sale case, to read the English language would be a circumstance which should be considered in determining whether or not he has been defrauded, the fact of such inability is not of itself sufficient to authorize the rescission of a contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Reformation requires mutual mistake.</b> - Equity will not reform a written contract on account of a mistake unless the mistake was one of both parties.

<p class="p4">Equity in a proper case may reform a written contract because of fraud on one side and mistake on the other; a contract may also be reformed for a mistake of both parties, but the evidence must show that the mistake was mutual. Helton v. Shellnut, 186 Ga. 185, 197 S.E. 287 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A petition for reformation of a written contract will lie where by mistake of the draftsman and by oversight of the parties, the writing does not embody or fully express the real contract of the parties. McLoon v. McLoon, 220 Ga. 18, 136 S.E.2d 740 (1964). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Reformation as applied to a contract is a remedy cognizable in equity for the purpose of correcting an instrument so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, where from some cause, such as fraud, accident, or mistake it does not express such intention. The remedy is not available for the purpose of making a new and different contract for the parties, but is confined to establishment of the actual agreement. Deck v. Shields, 195 Ga. 697, 25 S.E.2d 514 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although equity will not reform a written contract because of mistake as to the contents of the writing on the part of the complaining party, who is able to read but fails to do so, where no sufficient excuse appears as to why such party did not read the contract, such principle has not been extended to cases in which it is sought to reform written instruments on the ground of mutual mistake of fact. In all cases where the form of the conveyance or instrument is, by mutual mistake, contrary to the intention of the parties in their contract, equity will interfere to make it conform thereto. Eaton Yale &amp; Towne, Inc. v. Strickland, 228 Ga. 430, 185 S.E.2d 923 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A mistake in reference to the description of land conveyed on the part of one grantee, acting on behalf of other grantees who were absent, is a mistake on the part of all of them; and where the same mistake was made by the grantor, there would be a mistake of all the parties, within the rule as to mutuality. Lifsey v. Mims, 193 Ga. 780, 20 S.E.2d 32 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The mere failure to discover a conflict between the terms of an oral contract as to what a policy of insurance is to contain and what it actually contains until after a loss occurs is a circumstance to be considered by the jury in determining the truth of the issue, but such failure to discover the discrepancy will not bar the reformation of the contract as a matter of law.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>1. Insolvency</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insolvency as basis for rescission of contract.</b> - The grantor may maintain an equitable action to rescind the contract if the grantee is insolvent, or where fraud is employed by the grantee in the procurement of the deed, or there are other special facts which would make rescission by the grantor an appropriate relief. Although insolvency is frequently relied upon, breach of a contract for care and maintenance of the grantor upon the property conveyed present such special facts as authorize rescission. Head v. Walker, 243 Ga. 108, 252 S.E.2d 440 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While an absolute deed of conveyance will not be canceled, at the instance of the grantor, merely because of a breach by the grantee of a promise made by him, in consideration of which the deed was executed, and the remedy of the grantor in such a case is a suit for damages for such breach, yet where the grantee was insolvent, and 49 shares of stock were transferred to her in consideration of her learning the plaintiff's business and assisting in its operation, which service she failed and refused to render to the plaintiff, equity would decree a cancellation of the stock certificate and restore the same to the grantor. McGhee v. Minor, 188 Ga. 635, 4 S.E.2d 565 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>2. Ignorance of Fact</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ignorance of fact insufficient as basis for rescission of contract.</b> - While this section provides that equity may rescind and cancel a written contract upon the ground of mistake of fact material to the contract of one party only, ignorance of fact is no cause for rescinding a contract; and where by reasonable diligence the plaintiff could have ascertained the extent of his injuries, and there was no necessity for his rushing into a settlement, <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-33 giving him two years in which to bring an action to recover for such injuries, a court of equity will not relieve him from the injurious, unwise, or disadvantageous consequences of his own act in executing a release. James v. Tarpley, 209 Ga. 421, 73 S.E.2d 188 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A contractor who has bid for the excavation of highway sites on a basis of "unclassified material" may not, under the guise of mistake of fact, seek additional compensation in an action at law because the material excavated contained a higher percentage of rock than it expected, even though its only information at the time of the bid was results of test borings made available to it by the highway department (now Department of Transportation), where it was specifically stipulated that the data were not guaranteed and did not bind the department; where the department furnished all information which it had available, made no attempt to conceal actual conditions, and stipulated the provisional character of its tests, where the contractor had equal opportunity with the department to conduct its own investigation, and where the parties with knowledge of these facts elected to contract on a basis of material moved rather than to contract on a basis of the percentage of dirt and rock after removal. State Hwy. Dep't v. MacDougald Constr. Co., 102 Ga. App. 254, 115 S.E.2d 863 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the intention of both the insurer and the insured as to the amount of the premium is expressed in the application, as corrected by the insurer as therein authorized, to be $302.90 per quarter, a mistake of the draftsman of the insurer in writing into the policy at another place the amount of the premium as being $750.48 per year, instead of what the insurer claims to have been intended, $750.48 per quarter, is obviously the unilateral mistake of the insurer alone, and there is neither mutuality nor fraud that would authorize reformation to conform with what the insurer claims to have been intended. Davis v. United Am. Life Ins. Co., 215 Ga. 521, 111 S.E.2d 488 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Wrong property foreclosed upon.</b> - Trial court properly reformed security deed and declared that suing lender had first priority over certain tract of land since there was no doubt that parties intended for the tract to have been subject to the security deed alone; trial court also properly directed verdict in favor of suing lender as to its claim for rescission and cancellation of the deed it obtained when it mistakenly foreclosed on the wrong tract, as such relief was the proper remedy. DeGolyer v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 291 Ga. App. 444, 662 S.E.2d 141 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mistake.</b> - In a breach of contract action regarding a loan contract between the lender and its debtor, the debtor's failure to cite to facts in the record establishing that the $4,500 note was paid in full led to the conclusion that it was not, and the fact that the debtor might have made payments in excess of $25,000 regarding all the outstanding loans with the lender did not in and of itself prove that the $4,500 loan had been paid off. Jenkins v. Sallie Mae, Inc., 286 Ga. App. 502, 649 S.E.2d 802 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equitable relief for unilateral mistake requires evidence of fraud.</b> - Equity will grant appropriate relief for a mistake of fact by one party, accompanied by fraud on the part of the other, just as in cases where there is mutual mistake.

<p class="p4"><b>This section is a codification from the decision of Werner v. Rawson, 89 Ga. 619, 15 S.E. 813 (1892).</b> McCollum v. Loveless, 187 Ga. 262, 200 S.E. 115 (1938); Livingston v. Barnett, 193 Ga. 640, 19 S.E.2d 385 (1942); Hargrove v. Bledsoe, 78 Ga. App. 107, 50 S.E.2d 223 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This section does not entitle a party to relief against the consequences of gross and inexcusable negligence</b> in signing his name to a plain and unambiguous written instrument, when no fraud, artifice, or misrepresentation was employed to induce him to sign it, and when there is nothing to show that it did not embody the identical agreement which the other party actually intended to make. Holton Dodge, Inc. v. Baird, 118 Ga. App. 316, 163 S.E.2d 346 (1968). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity will not reform a written contract because of mistake as to the contents of the writing on the part of the complaining party (who was able to read), and fraud of the other which consists only in making false representations as to such contents, on which the complaining party relied as true because of confidence in the party making them; no fiduciary or confidential relation existed between the parties, and no sufficient excuse appears why the complaining party did not read the contract. This doctrine does not apply if the party seeking relief shows some good excuse for not reading the instrument. Livingston v. Barnett, 193 Ga. 640, 19 S.E.2d 385 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where no confidential relationship between the parties is alleged, a court of equity will not relieve a vendor of land from his own negligence in not ascertaining facts which he could have ascertained by diligence, the vendee using no artifice or fraudulent scheme in order to prevent the vendor from ascertaining facts which might have prevented him from executing the deed sought to be canceled. Jackson v. Brown, 209 Ga. 78, 70 S.E.2d 756 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Petition of negligent complainant subject to motion to dismiss.</b> - This section does not save a petition from a demurrer (now motion to dismiss) where the allegations, construed on demurrer (now motion to dismiss) most strongly against the petitioner, show affirmatively that the petitioner was guilty of negligence amounting to a violation of legal duty, and it does not appear that the other party was not prejudiced thereby. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 202 Ga. App. 752, 44 S.E.2d 543 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>But it is not essential that complainants should be clear of all vestige of fault or negligence on their part.</b> Dollar v. Fred W. Amend Co., 184 Ga. 432, 191 S.E. 696 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And the negligence of the party complaining will not defeat his right to reformation, if the other party has not been prejudiced thereby.</b> Sheldon v. Hargrose, 213 Ga. 672, 100 S.E.2d 898 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A petition which alleges that an instrument in the form of a deed, which was signed by an elderly, illiterate man who thought he was executing a will, and prays for cancellation on the ground of mistake does not show, on its face, negligence amounting to a violation of a legal duty so as to render the petition demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss). Jackson v. Jackson, 202 Ga. 634, 44 S.E.2d 250 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reformation of a deed.</b> - Trial court properly ordered reformation of a deed of assent to include an entire eight acre tract of land as opposed to only a partial strip because reformation was not barred by the seven-year statute of limitations since the seller was not prejudiced as the deed should have been corrected previously, thus, equitable relief under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-32(b) was appropriate. Ehlers v. Upper West Side, LLC, 292 Ga. 151, 733 S.E.2d 723 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rescission notwithstanding prohibition of bid withdrawal for negligence.</b> - Contractor was entitled to rescind its construction bid for a church building, where a clerical error had resulted in a seven percent discrepancy in the amount of the bid, notwithstanding bidding instructions which prohibited the contractor from withdrawing the bid on the ground of "negligence." First Baptist Church v. Barber Contracting Co., 189 Ga. App. 804, 377 S.E.2d 717 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lack of diligence constitutes negligence.</b> - Where both the appellant and counsel for the appellant could have with reasonable diligence discovered that the note in question bore interest from the date of its execution, the failure to exercise such diligence was negligence, which precluded reformation on ground of mutual mistake, since the appellee has been prejudiced by that negligence. Cox v. Smith, 244 Ga. 280, 260 S.E.2d 310 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Questions of fact as to diligence prevented judgment of reformation.</b> - In a suit by a shopping center mortgagee against an insurer and banks seeking damages after the insurer paid the mortgagor insurance proceeds for hail damage to the premises (and the mortgagor's agent fraudulently endorsed the check), the mortgagee was not entitled to summary judgment on the mortgagee's reformation claim based on its listing as a mortgagee/payee on the application and proof of loss form, but not in the policy, because there were issues as to its diligence in reviewing the policy. Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Hale Haven Props., 346 Ga. App. 39, 815 S.E.2d 574 (2018), cert. denied, No. S18C1423, 2019 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts of equity grant relief only in favor of the diligent,</b> and equity does not relieve from a judgment which could have been prevented except for negligence on the part of the complaining party. West v. Downer, 218 Ga. 235, 127 S.E.2d 359 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The failure of a petitioner to know the content defining the coverage of its insurance contract or to compare the facts and circumstances surrounding the injury to ascertain if it was covered thereby, and its failure to inquire of the employer or the Industrial Board (now Board of Workers' Compensation) as to the existence of an insurance contract with another insurance carrier that covered the injury, amounted to negligence on the part of the petitioner, and would not constitute such a mistake of fact as would render the agreement and the payments thereunder involuntary and, therefore, a basis for subrogation. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 202 Ga. 752, 44 S.E.2d 543 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An insurer was entitled to reformation of a policy</b> where coverage of a vehicle was extended at the insured's request, after the vehicle was involved in an accident; even though the insurer could have inquired before extending the coverage, the insured was not prejudiced by the insurer's action and would obtain a windfall absent reformation of the contract. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Woodruff, 215 Ga. App. 511, 451 S.E.2d 106 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery of payment mistakenly paid.</b> - In an action for money had and received, the plaintiff generally can recover a payment mistakenly made when that mistake was caused by his lack of diligence or his negligence in ascertaining the true facts and the other party would not be prejudiced by refunding the payment, subject to a weighing of the equities between the parties by the trier of fact. Gulf Life Ins. Co. v. Folsom, 256 Ga. 400, 349 S.E.2d 368 (1986) (relying solely on computer records); Graham v. Hogan, 185 Ga. App. 842, 366 S.E.2d 219 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Summary judgment for a retirement system was reversed because there were fact issues as to voluntary payment under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-13, and as to equitable estoppel under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-32, after the son claimed that the mother told the son that the benefits would continue to be paid after the mother's death; details of how the retirement system discovered the mother's death were needed to resolve the possibility that the son retained and spent the money in good faith. Applebury v. Teachers' Ret. Sys., 275 Ga. App. 194, 620 S.E.2d 452 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The voluntary payment doctrine did not bar a city's unjust enrichment and conversion claims filed against a construction contractor, as the contractor failed to show that: (1) a genuine issue of material fact remained over whether the city was negligent in ascertaining the true facts; and (2) any prejudice would result if the mistaken duplicate payment the city made to the contractor were returned to the city. D &amp; H Constr. Co. v. City of Woodstock, 284 Ga. App. 314, 643 S.E.2d 826 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendants not prejudiced, plaintiff's alleged negligence no defense to claim for money had and received.</b> - Lawyer falsely told clients that the clients' lawsuit was settled, paid the clients money the lawyer obtained by kiting checks from the law firm's bank accounts, and defrauded a relative into lending the lawyer money to cover the shortage in the accounts. As the relative's failure to fully investigate the facts before making the loan did not prejudice the clients, any negligence on the relative's part was not a defense under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-32 to the relative's claim against the clients for money had and received. Haugabook v. Crisler, 297 Ga. App. 428, 677 S.E.2d 355 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Considerations by jury in claim for money had and received.</b> - The equities to be considered by the jury in the case of a claim for money had and received are: (1) the degree of negligence on the plaintiff's part in erroneously paying over the money, (2) the level of good faith with which the defendant acted in receiving and retaining the money, and (3) prejudice, i.e., whether the defendant's position has so changed that it would be unfair to require him to pay the money back. Gulf Life Ins. Co. v. Folsom, 907 F.2d 1115 (11th Cir. 1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action for money had and received, where the plaintiff was negligent, the plaintiff is entitled to get his money back - unless the jury decides that he doesn't deserve it back or that the defendant deserves to keep it. Gulf Life Ins. Co. v. Folsom, 907 F.2d 1115 (11th Cir. 1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of material change of position by payee of funds sought to be recovered.</b> - The superior court did not err in ruling that a recipient of Medicaid reimbursement funds had so changed its position in reliance on its hospital-based classification during the period in question that it would be unjust to require it to refund the monies in question. Department of Medical Assistance v. Presbyterian Home, Inc., 200 Ga. App. 885, 409 S.E.2d 881 (1991), cert. denied, No. S91C1697, 1992 Ga. LEXIS 357 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment of late charges.</b> - The voluntary payment doctrine barred claims for recovery of late fees paid by cable television subscribers under a service agreement with the cable company which stated that a late fee would be charged to a customer's account if payment was not received by the due date. Telescripps Cable Co. v. Welsh, 247 Ga. App. 282, 542 S.E.2d 640 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Wrong property foreclosed upon.</b> - Trial court properly reformed security deed and declared that suing lender had first priority over certain tract of land since there was no doubt that parties intended for the tract to have been subject to the security deed alone; trial court also properly directed verdict in favor of suing lender as to its claim for rescission and cancellation of the deed it obtained when it mistakenly foreclosed on the wrong tract, as such relief was the proper remedy. DeGolyer v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 291 Ga. App. 444, 662 S.E.2d 141 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Company required to honor bid price on foreclosed property.</b> - Superior court did not err in granting a purchaser summary judgment in its action seeking specific performance pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-131 requiring a mortgage company to deliver a deed conveying certain property because the company failed to demonstrate any merit in the company's contention that the superior court improperly refused to invoke the court's equitable power to relieve the company from performing under the foreclosure sale contract on the ground that the opening bid it set forth was a mistake. O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-32(b) did not provide relief from the foreclosure sale contract because the company failed to show how the purchaser would not be prejudiced if the company were granted relief and the record was void of any evidence that there was no difference between the contract price and the fair market value of the real property. Decision One Mortg. Co., LLC v. Victor Warren Props., Inc., 304 Ga. App. 423, 696 S.E.2d 145 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 23-2-32(b) did not apply to a son's action to quiet title to a parcel of land</b> because the original grantor, the son's father, no longer owned the land, and buyers of the land were bona fide purchasers who had no notice of the mistake in the deed until two years after the purchasers' purchased the property from the bank. Haffner v. Davis, 290 Ga. 753, 725 S.E.2d 286 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial of request for reformation of contract held proper.</b> - Trial court properly entered judgment in favor of a purchaser in a bank's action seeking reformation of a security deed and cancellation of the levy and sale of two lots; while O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-32(b) stated that relief could be granted even in cases of negligence by the complainant if it appears that the other party has not been prejudiced thereby, the purchaser had begun making repairs and improving the property, and had spent<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$12,410 and continued to incur expenses, and thus, the trial court's finding that the purchaser would be prejudiced by the reformation sought by the bank was not clearly erroneous.

<p class="p4">The mere fact that plaintiff grantee and defendant grantee had entered into an agreement with the common grantor whereby each was to purchase separately from the common grantor one half of a described city lot, could not possibly constitute each grantee "an original party" to the deed of conveyance to the other within statute permitting reformation. Hilton v. Hilton, 202 Ga. 53, 41 S.E.2d 880 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It is an elementary principle of law that a privy, either in law, fact, or estate, has no greater right than the one with whom he is in privity,</b> accordingly, since the plaintiff's father would have been estopped in law to attack and thus question the validity of the divorce which he procured from the plaintiff's mother, it logically follows that the plaintiff himself is also estopped to do so.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lack of standing in equity.</b> - Decedent's estate administrator lacked standing to challenge the three assignments of the security deed in a non-judicial foreclosure sale because the administrator was not a party to the assignment contracts, and the administrator did not have standing in equity to seek relief because the administrator was not seeking reformation of the deed and did not allege mutual mistake.

<p class="p4"><b>Reformation of agreement was not permitted against bona fide purchaser of promissory note.</b> - In a suit on a promissory note by a lender's assignee, although some evidence supported the borrowers' claim that terms in a Forbearance Agreement (FA) binding the guarantors were the product of mutual mistake and release of the guarantors was intended, the trial court erred in reforming the FA because the borrowers had not overcome the presumption that the assignee was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the mistake.

<p class="p10"><b>1. Privies</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section extends equitable relief to privies to contract, etc.</b> - The general rule, which allows only the parties to a judgment to attack and thus question its validity, has been relaxed in this state by this section, however, the privity either in law, in fact, or in estate, which will permit one to attack and thus question the validity of a judgment to which he is not a party has no personal basis as a mere matter of sentiment, but rests upon some actual mutual or successive relationship as to the same right of property. Phillips v. Phillips, 211 Ga. 305, 85 S.E.2d 427 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>But section extends no rights to one not privy under original contract.</b> - Primarily the right to reform a contract belongs to the original parties thereto. The recognized extension, under this section, in favor of those in privity with the original contractors does not mean that the terms of a contract can be altered and reformed by one who does not claim as a successor under the contract sought to be reformed, but under another contract, setting up different and inconsistent rights. In such a case, the subsequent grantee's quarrel is with the person from whom he derived his title, rather than with the one holding adversely under a prior and different contract, to which he was admittedly neither party nor privy. Rawson v. Brosnan, 187 Ga. 624, 1 S.E.2d 423 (1939); Hilton v. Hilton, 202 Ga. 53, 41 S.E.2d 880 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a quiet title action, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the adjoining landowners as the suing neighbor was not entitled to reformation of corrective deeds entered into between the suing neighbor's predecessor in title and the adjoining landowners since the suing neighbor was not a party to the corrective deeds.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirement of privity of contract, etc., applies to remedy of reformation and to remedy of cancellation.</b> - The rule requiring mutuality or privity of contract or estate, applies not only to the equitable remedy of reformation but to that of cancellation or other equitable relief against the effect of an instrument. Volunteer State Life Ins. Co. v. Powell-White Co., 187 Ga. 705, 1 S.E.2d 662 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the plaintiff in ejectment was the prior grantee of the tract sued for, not being a privy in law, fact, or estate with the defendant, who held under a subsequent deed from the common grantor, the defendant could not defend by reforming the plaintiff's deed so as to strike therefrom, as having been included by mutual mistake, the tract subsequently conveyed to the defendant.

<p class="p4">Where personal property is sold, and a bill of sale with warranty of title is executed by the vendor, and the property is again sold with warranty of title, the last vendee and his vendor may join in an equitable petition against the original vendor, having for its purpose the reformation of the original bill of sale by including certain items of property omitted therefrom by mutual mistake. Chapman v. Cassels Co., 180 Ga. 349, 179 S.E. 91 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the absolute title to property is apparently in a vendor or mortgagor, the vendee or mortgagee is protected, unless the one seeking to set up a lien or trust against the property can show that the vendee or mortgagee had notice of trust funds having gone into the property. Tattnall Bank v. Harvey, 186 Ga. 752, 198 S.E. 724 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The mere fact that purchaser might have had some knowledge of a mingling by his vendor of trust funds with his own is not sufficient to charge the vendee with notice that trust funds had been diverted in the purchase of a particular piece of land. Tattnall Bank v. Harvey, 186 Ga. 752, 198 S.E. 724 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the original vendor of the land died intestate, and there was no administrator or personal representative of the decedent at the time the suit was brought, a suit could be maintained against the sole heir at law of the intestate, as he was apparently the only party who was interested in resisting the suit. Steadham v. Cobb, 183 Ga. 30, 196 S.E. 730 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A petition in equity by a husband seeking to cancel two concurrent verdicts and a decree obtained in the same court in a former divorce suit by the wife against her former husband, and to have declared the continued existence of the former marriage, thereby establishing incapacity of the wife to marry at the time of her marriage to the plaintiff, was subject to a general demurrer (now motion to dismiss).

<p class="p4">Taking as true for purposes of a Chapter 7 trustee's motion for judgment on the pleadings a bank's contention that the parties involved in the sale, financing, and purchase of the property at issue intended that the property be conveyed to the debtor wife alone and intended that the security deed encumber the entire property rather than only an undivided one-half interest, the bank was not entitled to reformation of a special warranty deed (SWD) under Georgia law because as a security deed grantee, it was not an original party to the SWD or in privity with any party to the SWD.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Privy applied to Internal Revenue Service.</b> - Internal Revenue Service, by reason of the fact that it was asserting a tax lien against property that inadvertently had been omitted from a conveyance deed, was a privy in law that was bound under Georgia law by a reformed conveyance because O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-34 provided that equity will grant relief as between the original parties or their privies in law, in fact, or in estate, except bona fide purchasers for value without notice.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section protects interests of bona fide purchasers.</b> - It is a rule in equity that a bona fide purchaser without notice, to be entitled to protection, must be so, not only at the time of the contract or conveyance, but until the purchase money is actually paid. Ross v. Rambo, 195 Ga. 100, 23 S.E.2d 687 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A partial payment of the purchase money before notice of the equitable title of the true owners, although not sufficient to invest the vendee with the character of a bona fide purchaser as regards the entire estate purchased, will entitle him to invoke the aid of the equitable principle that he who asks equity must do equity and to be reimbursed for the amount actually paid before. Ross v. Rambo, 195 Ga. 100, 23 S.E.2d 687 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a husband contracts to buy land for value and directs conveyance thereof to his wife, no inference will arise that the wife is a purchaser for value, without notice of equities in favor of the vendor as against the vendee; and if the deed to the wife does not express the true agreement between the husband and the vendor, on account of mistake of the draftsman and mutual mistake of the vendor and the original vendee, the deed may be reformed so as to speak the true agreement. Cain v. Varnadore, 171 Ga. 497, 156 S.E. 216 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a husband fraudulently seeks and obtains a divorce from his wife in a court of his selection, he and his privies in law, in fact, or in estate, are thereafter conclusively estopped to assail the validity of the decree to the prejudice of innocent parties. Phillips v. Phillips, 211 Ga. 305, 85 S.E.2d 427 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Creditor could not prevail on the creditor's claim for equitable reformation of a security deed executed by a debtor that did not own the property because nothing in the chain of title provided constructive notice to a potential purchaser of the property of the creditor's equitable interest in the property. Stearns Bank, N.A. v. Rent-A-Tent, Inc. (In re Rent A Tent, Inc.), 468 Bankr. 442 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>While it is the rule that a bona fide purchaser of property in which trust funds have been invested is protected,</b> the beneficiary of a trust estate may at his option, within a reasonable time, "affirm or reject an unauthorized investment by the trustee," and equity will aid the beneficiary in recovering the funds or property, or enforcing a lien for the wrongfully used funds, provided that the assets can be traced and remain in the hands of a person "affected with notice of the misapplication."

<p class="p4">Petition seeking to rescind a conditional bill of sale because of alleged fraudulent representations of the vendor as to the kind, quality, and condition of the personalty sold, to recover the portion of the purchase money paid by the vendee, and for injunction, cancellation, and accounting, in which are set up no peculiar circumstances showing a necessity of interposition by a court of equity, such as insolvency or nonresidence of the vendor, is not maintainable in equity, as the plaintiff has an adequate and complete remedy at law, nor would the fact that it was alleged that the vendor was threatening to transfer the conditional sale contract to a third person afford any ground for equitable relief, under the facts. Williford v. Haverty Furn. Co., 183 Ga. 707, 189 S.E. 521 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud is either actual or constructive, and either constitutes legal fraud.</b> Jordan v. Belvin, 57 Ga. 719, 196 S.E. 132 (1938); Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fraud may be actual or constructive; actual fraud consists in any kind of artifice by which another is deceived, and constructive fraud consists in any act of omission or commission, contrary to legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence justly reposed, which is contrary to good conscience and operates to the injury of another. Brittain Bros. Co. v. Davis, 174 Ga. 1, 161 S.E. 841 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Either actual or constructive fraud may consist in the misrepresentation of a material fact.</b> Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Fraud is exceedingly subtle in its nature and can be accomplished by infinite means; it may be perpetrated by signs and tricks, and even silence may in some instances amount to fraud. Sapp v. ABC Credit &amp; Inv. Co., 243 Ga. 151, 253 S.E.2d 82 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud cannot consist of mere broken promises, unfulfilled predictions, or erroneous conjectures as to future events.</b> C.P.D. Chem. Co. v. National Car Rental Sys., 148 Ga. App. 756, 252 S.E.2d 665 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constructive fraud, as well as actual fraud, voids the contract at the election of the injured party,</b> and may authorize a rescission of a written release from liability. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Fisher, 72 Ga. App. 717, 34 S.E.2d 906 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While only actual fraud will authorize an ex parte rescission of a sale of personalty so as to enable the aggrieved party to sue at law, as in trover, for property that he may have delivered to the other under the contract, a sale either of realty or of personalty may be rescinded by a court for mere constructive fraud, where the other essentials of the case are established. Puckett v. Reese, 203 Ga. 716, 48 S.E.2d 297 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>2. Misrepresentation Generally</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Any misrepresentation intended to deceive and which does deceive is a fraud,</b> for which a party is entitled to a remedy at law. Oliver v. O'Kelley, 48 Ga. App. 762, 173 S.E. 232 (1934); Thompson v. Wilkins, 143 Ga. App. 739, 240 S.E.2d 183 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit by the seller for the purchase money of land, the defendant purchaser is entitled to plead that he was not put in possession of the premises and that the seller was guilty of false and fraudulent representations as to the existence of liens on the premises, and, upon proof of such facts, a verdict in his favor is authorized. Oliver v. O'Kelley, 48 Ga. App. 762, 173 S.E. 232 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the owner of land represented to the purchaser that there was no encumbrance against the premises sold, thereby inducing him to purchase it, and it was found later to be encumbered, this constituted a fraudulent representation for which relief will be given the purchaser. Oliver v. O'Kelley, 48 Ga. App. 762, 173 S.E. 232 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A misrepresentation by a director to a person purchasing stock concerning the financial condition of the corporation is actionable. Daniel v. Dalton News Co., 48 Ga. App. 772, 173 S.E. 727 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To state that a certain individual had signed contract as surety and that her signature was genuine was a misrepresentation of material existing fact, a fraudulent thing in law which would avoid the contract. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Kelly, 78 Ga. App. 10, 50 S.E.2d 113 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Innocent misstatement may amount to negligence but is not fraud.</b> Day v. Randolph, 159 Ga. App. 474, 283 S.E.2d 687 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In the absence of a confidential relationship a party may not rely and act on the misrepresentations of an opposite party</b> as to the contents of a written instrument where the party signing can read and where no artifice or fraud is practiced which prevents the party signing from reading the instrument. Robi v. Goldstein, 100 Ga. App. 606, 112 S.E.2d 165 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the absence of special circumstances one must exercise ordinary diligence in making an independent verification of contractual terms and representations, failure to do which will bar an action based on fraud. Hubert v. Beale Roofing, Inc., 158 Ga. App. 145, 279 S.E.2d 336 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">One cannot claim to be defrauded about a matter equally open to the observation of all parties where no special relation of trust or confidence exists. Hubert v. Beale Roofing, Inc., 158 Ga. App. 145, 279 S.E.2d 336 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Misrepresentations are not actionable unless the hearer was justified in relying on them</b> in the exercise of common prudence and diligence. Daugert v. Holland Furnace Co., 107 Ga. App. 566, 130 S.E.2d 763 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statements as to future acts merely promissory in their nature are not actionable.</b> Boatman v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 155 Ga. App. 848, 273 S.E.2d 190 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A misrepresentation of a present state of mind is actionable as fraud.</b> McFarland v. Kim, 156 Ga. App. 781, 275 S.E.2d 364 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the plaintiffs represented to the defendant that they would sign a guarantee of defendant's obligations under the lease, knowing that they had no intention of ever doing this in the future, this would not be a broken promise as to a future act but would be a misrepresentation of a present state of mind and actionable as fraud. The failure of the plaintiffs to sign such a guarantee when presented to them by the landlord is some evidence that they had no intention at any time to complete that act. McFarland v. Kim, 156 Ga. App. 781, 275 S.E.2d 364 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Misrepresentations as to a question of law cannot constitute remediable fraud,</b> because everyone is presumed to know the law and therefore cannot in legal contemplation be deceived by erroneous statements of law, and such representations are ordinarily regarded as mere expressions of opinion. Sorrells v. Atlanta Transit Sys., 218 Ga. 623, 129 S.E.2d 846 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of party to protect self against fraud.</b> - While a party must exercise reasonable diligence to protect himself against the fraud of another, he is not bound to exhaust all means at his command to ascertain the truth before relying upon the representations. Ordinarily the question whether the complaining party could have ascertained the falsity of the representations by proper diligence is for determination by the jury. Gaines v. Watts, 224 Ga. 321, 161 S.E.2d 830 (1968). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the means of knowledge are at hand and equally available to both parties to a contract of sale, if the purchaser does not avail himself of these means, he will not be heard to say, in impeachment of the contract, that he was deceived by the representations of the seller. Lorick v. Na-Churs Plant Food Co., 150 Ga. App. 209, 257 S.E.2d 332 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>3. Actual Fraud</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actual fraud predicated on intent.</b> - Whether a fraud is actual depends on whether the false representation was made with the purpose and intent to deceive. Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In any suit sounding in tort for damages on account of actual fraud, the gist of the action is the purpose and design to deceive. Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actual fraud involves moral guilt,</b> since there must be an intentional purpose to deceive. Turner v. Ware, 2 Ga. App. 57, 58 S.E. 310 (1907); Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A material misrepresentation constituting actual fraud may give rise to an independent action in tort for deceit,</b> to recover for damage thus occasioned. In such a suit it is necessary to show, not only that a material misrepresentation was made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act, that he had a right to act, and that he did act thereon to his injury, but it must be shown that such representation was willfully and knowingly false, or what the law regards as the equivalent of knowledge, a reckless or fraudulent representation about that which the party pretends to know, but about which he knows that he does not know, and by which false pretense his purpose and intent is to deceive. Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Essential elements.</b> - In an independent affirmative action for fraud and deceit, which must be predicated upon actual fraud, the plaintiff must allege and prove the following essential ingredients: (1) the defendant made the representations; (2) at the time he knew they were false (or what the law regards as the equivalent of knowledge, a fraudulent or reckless representation of facts as true, which the party may not know to be false, if intended to deceive); (3) the defendant made the representations with the intention and purpose of deceiving the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff relied upon such representations; (5) the plaintiff sustained the alleged loss and damage as the proximate result of their having been made; and (6) (an element frequently omitted in the cases enumerating the essentials), want of knowledge by the party alleged to have been deceived that the representation was false. It is essential that the plaintiff was deceived and there can be no deceit if the plaintiff knows that the representations upon which he is alleged to have acted were false. Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959); Romedy v. Willett Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., 136 Ga. App. 67, 220 S.E.2d 74 (1975); C.P.D. Chem. Co. v. National Car Rental Sys., 148 Ga. App. 756, 252 S.E.2d 665 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To allege fraud, the claimant must contend the defendant knowingly made a false representation with the intent and purpose of deceiving the plaintiff. Additionally, there must be a reliance on such representations and a loss sustained thereby. The misrepresentations must also relate to a preexisting or present fact and not statements or representations involving future conduct. Cone Mills Corp. v. A.G. Estes, Inc., 377 F. Supp. 222 (N.D. Ga. 1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A promise to take title to the property, farm it, pay off the debt existing thereon, and then to reconvey it to the plaintiff, made as an inducement or consideration for the execution of a deed by plaintiff, does not constitute fraud, so as to authorize cancellation of the deed, or a decree of specific performance of the agreement to convey, unless the promise was made with the present intention not to comply with it. A mere failure to comply with the promise would be insufficient to establish such fraudulent intent. Dixon v. Dixon, 211 Ga. 557, 87 S.E.2d 369 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The five elements of fraud and deceit in Georgia are: (1) false representation made by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) an intention to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from acting in reliance by the plaintiff; (4) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (5) damage to the plaintiff. Marriott Corp. v. American Academy of Psychotherapists, Inc., 157 Ga. App. 497, 277 S.E.2d 785 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The five elements necessary to be shown in an action for fraud are that the misrepresentation or falsehood was knowingly made, that it related to a material fact, that its purpose was to deceive another and induce him to act, that he did act upon it and that he was injured as a result. Day v. Randolph, 159 Ga. App. 474, 283 S.E.2d 687 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Actual fraud is not essential to support an action in equity to rescind a contract for fraud,</b> or to a plea of fraud to a suit on a contract; innocently made material misrepresentations which the opposite party has a right to act on, and does act on to his injury, and which amount only to constructive fraud, being sufficient in these last two instances. By a parity of reasoning, actual fraud is not essential to the setting aside of an accord and satisfaction. Jordan v. Belvin, 57 Ga. 719, 196 S.E. 132 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b>4. Constructive Fraud</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Constructive fraud does not involve moral guilt,</b> since it is the act itself, as taken in connection with the relationship of the parties, and not the guilty purpose or intent, which constitutes constructive fraud.

<p class="p4">Innocent misrepresentations, when made by one charged with a special duty to the opposite party to know and to impart the truth, under the statutes and decisions of this state cannot amount to anything more than constructive fraud, and, as such, are not creative of any independent right of action for damages in tort in favor of the injured party; but they may support an action in equity to rescind a contract so induced or be pleaded in defense to a suit on a contract thus procured, or may, it might seem, under the doctrine of estoppel, be employed in support of an action founded on the contract itself. Gaultney v. Windham, 99 Ga. App. 800, 109 S.E.2d 914 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a person having legal title to land, which fact he does not know but has convenient means of knowing, and after a lapse of 27 years, during which time he was under no legal disability, he still has not learned the fact of his interest in the land, and in those circumstances he induces one to buy the land from a third person by representations that the land is the property of such third person, his misrepresentations to the purchaser innocently made, coupled with his delay in ascertaining the truth, will amount to constructive fraud, and they may be pleaded as an estoppel by the purchaser on the faith of the title of his vendor. Lanier v. Bryant, 180 Ga. 409, 179 S.E. 346 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where insured furnished false evidence which was relied upon by the insurance company in reinstating insurance policies he was guilty of fraud in law which would avoid the policy, whether he was in good or bad faith and whether he intended to deceive or not.

<p class="p4">Constructive fraud may arise out of any act of omission or commission, contrary to legal or equitable duty, trust or confidence justly reposed, which is contrary to good conscience and operates to the injury of another; constructive fraud may moreover be consistent with innocence and not smacking with moral guilt. Graham v. Hogan, 185 Ga. App. 842, 366 S.E.2d 219 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Contrary to good conscience" requirement.</b> - Where there is no evidence of suppression, misrepresentation or concealment or bad faith so as to impute moral guilt, the mere omission of a matter from a document coupled with the failure to reveal the omission can hardly be even constructive fraud unless it is "contrary to good conscience." Rhodes v. Perimeter Properties, Inc., 187 Ga. App. 55, 369 S.E.2d 332 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of constructive fraud.</b> - Where claimant was seeking workers' compensation benefits from the employer based on her alleged total disability and inability to work but at the same time she took this position before the Workers' Compensation Board, she was gainfully employed by a different employer, this is evidence sufficient to support the superior court's finding of constructive fraud.

<p class="p4">Even though a bank had a duty to notify its customer of a change in its signature verification procedures, where there was no evidence that the bank refrained from informing its customers in order to induce them to take or refrain from taking any certain action, there was no showing of constructive fraud.

<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>False identities.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to the auto dealer, mortgage broker, and the lender on the accused person's contention that they committed constructive fraud by approving and acting upon the credit application filled out by another person who used the accused person's name to obtain the financing necessary to purchase a truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Constructive fraud is an equitable doctrine that would not support the accused person's request for damages under these circumstances, especially since the evidence did not show they knew or should have known of the impropriety surrounding the transaction.

<p class="p4"><b>Confidential relationships.</b> - Executor's claim that a brother and a wife committed constructive fraud by withdrawing money from a decedent's bank account while the decedent was living with them prior to the decedent's death was dismissed on summary judgment; even if a confidential relationship existed between the decedent and the brother and the wife, the executor could not seek money damages on a claim brought under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-51(b).

<p class="p4"><b>Constructive fraud not found.</b> - Superior court did not err in failing to vacate an order allowing an employee to change an authorized treating physician, as the employer failed to show that due to the employee's misleading service and the Board's loss of its pleadings, it was the victim of constructive fraud which amounted to the deprivation of due process; while the employer should have been served with the evidence presented to the administrative law judge, and the Board should have properly handled the employee's filings, the employer could not show that it suffered any harm or injury.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No fraud shown on part of developer.</b> - In an action brought by the purchasers of a lot seeking to cancel the developer's security deed based upon alleged fraud, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the developer as, even if the developer knew of the sale of the lot to the purchasers, such sale did not estop the developer from the developer's claim against the lot pursuant to the developer's security deed; however, the trial court did err by denying the equitable subrogation claim asserted by the purchasers' lender since exercising subrogation did not prejudice the developer in any manner. Byers v. McGuire Props., 285 Ga. 530, 679 S.E.2d 1 (2009), overruled on other grounds by SRM Group, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of Am., 2020 Ga.

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, 107 Ga. App. 348, 130 S.E.2d 144, cert. dismissed, 219 Ga. 211, 132 S.E.2d 556 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election of remedies.</b> - When a vendee is induced to enter into a contract for the purchase of land by the fraud of the vendor, when the former discovers the fraud he has an election of remedies. One of such remedies is to rescind the contract, and another is to affirm the contract and sue for damages for the fraud. Price v. Mitchell, 154 Ga. App. 523, 268 S.E.2d 743 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>2. Rescission</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rescission of transaction based on misrepresentation authorized.</b> - Material misrepresentation, made for the purpose of inducing another to execute a promissory note, will authorize the maker, after executing the note, to rescind the transaction on discovery, of the fraud, if he relied upon the representation and was induced thereby to execute the note. Thompson v. Wilkins, 143 Ga. App. 739, 240 S.E.2d 183 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A promise to do a certain thing for the benefit of the promisee, made to induce his entrance into a contract, the promisee earnestly believing that he would receive the benefits consequent upon the fulfillment of the promise, when at the time of making the promise there was no intention on the part of the promisor to fulfill it, but, on the contrary, the promise was made with intent not to fulfill it and was uttered as a mere scheme or device to defraud, is such a fraud as will void any contract induced thereby. A promise thus fraudulently made will authorize rescission of a written instrument purporting to be a contract. Price v. Mitchell, 154 Ga. App. 523, 268 S.E.2d 743 (1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Constructive fraud, as well as actual fraud, voids the contract at the election of the injured party, and may authorize a rescission of a written release from liability. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Fisher, 72 Ga. App. 717, 34 S.E.2d 906 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A material representation falsely made by a vendor to a vendee to induce a sale, and made with knowledge of its falsity and acted upon to the vendee's injury, amounts to actual fraud, and will void a contract, and authorize rescission by the vendee if he acts promptly after discovery of the fraud and restores or offers to restore whatever of value he has received by virtue of the contract. Price v. Mitchell, 154 Ga. App. 523, 268 S.E.2d 743 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>3. Damages</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages generally.</b> - Misrepresentation of a material fact, made by one of the parties to a contract, though made by mistake, and innocently, if acted on by the opposite party, constitutes legal fraud, and the party injured in consequence thereof may set up the damages thus arising in defense to an action upon the contract. Morton v. W.T. Tharpe &amp; Co., 41 Ga. App. 788, 154 S.E. 716 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a vendor agrees to sell a designated tract of land to another and points out to the latter its boundaries and where such boundaries include lands to which the vendor has no title, in consequence of which the purchaser loses the same, the purchaser can setoff at law the value of the portion of the land so lost, against the purchase money whether the representations were designedly made by the vendor to deceive the purchaser, or were innocently made. Bonner v. Cotton, 223 Ga. 843, 159 S.E.2d 61 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where there is a material misrepresentation, a policy (of insurance) may be voided.</b> State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, 107 Ga. App. 348, 130 S.E.2d 144, cert. dismissed, 219 Ga. 211, 132 S.E.2d 556 (1963). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where insured furnished false evidence which was relied upon by the insurance company in reinstating insurance policies he was guilty of fraud in law which would void the policy, whether he was in good or bad faith and whether he intended to deceive or not. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Odom, 93 F.2d 641 (5th Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 304 U.S. 566, 58 S. Ct. 948, 82 L. Ed. 1532 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ordinary Diligence</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ordinary diligence required of party claiming injury.</b> - One cannot claim to be defrauded by the false representation of another where, by the exercise of ordinary diligence, such person could have discovered the falsity of the representations before acting thereon. Barrett v. Independent Order of Foresters, 625 F.2d 73 (5th Cir. 1980). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An equitable action to cancel a deed on the ground of fraud, which clearly shows that the complainant failed to use even slight diligence to discover the fraud, fails to allege a cause of action. Courts of equity will not grant relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of the truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the action. Whitfield v. Whitfield, 204 Ga. 64, 48 S.E.2d 852 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Blind reliance exists where it cannot be said that the purchase originated in fraud so much as in the carelessness of the purchaser to exercise ordinary care for his own interest. Adkins v. Lee, 127 Ga. App. 261, 193 S.E.2d 252 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the doctrine of caveat emptor would charge the purchaser with looking out for the title which the seller had to the tract offered for sale as his, it would not charge him with looking out for the boundaries of that tract when the seller undertook to locate and point them out, thus professing to know them sufficiently to enable them to furnish this information to purchasers instead of leaving the latter to their own resources in acquiring the information. Bonner v. Cotton, 223 Ga. 843, 159 S.E.2d 61 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to open trunk of car represented as new.</b> - It cannot be said as a matter of law that failure of plaintiff to open trunk of car represented as new in order to inspect for damage, either at time of purchase or within three and a half months thereafter amounted to failure of due diligence. Horne v. Claude Ray Ford Sales, Inc., 162 Ga. App. 329, 290 S.E.2d 497 (1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>In order to give rise to an action for damages, the defendant's fraud must be actual,</b> i.e., the misrepresentation must be made either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the consequences. Irvin v. Lowe's of Gainesville, Inc., 165 Ga. App. 828, 302 S.E.2d 734 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No obligation to disclose information equally available to both parties in arms-length business or contractual relationship.</b> - While concealment of material facts may amount to fraud when the concealment is of intrinsic qualities the other party could not discover by the exercise of ordinary care, in an arms-length business or contractual relationship there is no obligation to disclose information which is equally available to both parties. Under such circumstances, actionable fraud cannot be shown unless the plaintiff exercised due care to discover the fraud. Southern Intermodal Logistics, Inc. v. Smith &amp; Kelly Co., 190 Ga. App. 584, 379 S.E.2d 612 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Attorney for opposing party had no duty to advise of legal rights.</b> - In taxpayers' claim against a purchaser's assignee for rescission of a redemption agreement, the facts did not support rescission. The assignee's attorney did not defraud them or conceal any facts, but advised them to hire an attorney, and any failure to advise them of their legal rights was an opinion as to a matter of law and not a material fact.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Responsibilities of real estate brokers.</b> - Listing broker was not obligated to communicate to the couple that the home they purchased was slightly smaller in size than the subdivision's model home the couple wanted duplicated on their lot as the purchase contract plainly stated that the couple had no right to rely on the listing broker as the couple's broker, that the couple had no confidential relationship with the listing broker, and that the couple was solely responsible for protecting the couple's own interests, as the couple was required to exercise due diligence before it could rely on the listing broker's representations and the couple did not do so.

<p class="p4">Potential buyer did not have a viable common law cause of action for fraud and deceit against a real estate broker and a real estate agent because, as set forth in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-6A-4(a), no confidential or fiduciary relationship was created between the buyer and the broker and the agent as a matter of law.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to disclose decision bypassing real estate agent to avoid paying a commission was fraud.</b> - Trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on a real estate agent's fraud claim against an owner for failing to disclose the owner's decision to directly engage a contractor presented to it by the agent, bypassing its commission agreement with the agent. The economic loss rule did not bar the claim. ASC Constr. Equip. USA, Inc. v. City Commer. Real Estate, Inc., 303 Ga. App. 309, 693 S.E.2d 559 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure of insured not to supply health information.</b> - The failure of the insured to supply information as to health problems when no inquiry is made by the insurer or its agents and neither the certificate or master policy of insurance inform the insured that certain illnesses are not covered will not raise a defense of fraud or material misrepresentation in a suit on a credit life insurance policy. Block v. Voyager Life Ins. Co., 251 Ga. 162, 303 S.E.2d 742 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No recovery for failure to disclose when no harm shown.</b> - In a dispute between a concert booking agent and concert venue owners, the agent's fraud claim arising out of the owners' alleged promises to renew the agreement failed because the agent failed to show that the promises caused the agent harm. There was no evidence suggesting that the owners failed to disclose the owners' decision to terminate the agreement. Lucas Entm't Grp., LLC v. Robert W.

<p class="p4"><b>Expert testimony was required.</b> - Trial court did not err by granting a doctor summary judgment in a medical fraud suit because the suing patient failed to present expert testimony as to whether the pre-surgery x-rays should have put a doctor on notice of a deformity as such a determination was not within a layperson's common understanding and experience and, instead, required expert testimony. Johnson v. Johnson, 323 Ga. App. 836, 747 S.E.2d 518 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Land purchaser's duty to disclose mineral deposit.</b> - The mere fact that purchaser of land alone had knowledge of a large kaolin deposit does not impose a duty on the purchaser to reveal this information to sellers. One's duty to disclose would arise from the confidential relations of the parties or from the particular circumstances of the case. McLendon v. Georgia Kaolin Co., 782 F.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Withholding information about excavation site.</b> - Withheld information appeared to have been material to a contractor's ability to prepare a responsible bid for a contract to excavate a site, where the withheld reports contained information about the presence of excessive moisture at the site and stated that the standard proctor test should be used rather than the more difficult modified proctor test required by the specifications, and that both the excavations and the fill should be dried before compaction. Such activity would have undoubtedly increased the cost of performance of the contract. Pinkerton &amp; Laws Co. v. Roadway Express, Inc., 650 F. Supp. 1138 (N.D. Ga. 1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Welch v. Holley, 191 Ga. App. 532, 382 S.E.2d 128 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the co-executors in a constructive fraud or conspiracy claim filed by the beneficiaries of an estate because it was necessary for a jury to decide whether the co-executors committed constructive fraud or engaged in a conspiracy.

<p class="p4">Even though a bank had a duty to notify its customer of a change in its signature verification procedures, where there was no evidence that the bank refrained from informing its customers in order to induce them to take or refrain from taking any certain action, there was no showing of constructive fraud. Eason Publications, Inc. v. Nationsbank, 217 Ga. App. 726, 458 S.E.2d 899 (1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a debtor failed to disclose to a creditor that business assets were no longer available to secure a loan upon its renewal, the debt was not dischargeable in bankruptcy because the renewal was obtained by false pretenses.

<p class="p4">Fraud may exist as much in intentional concealment of material facts as in false statements in regard to facts; one is as fraudulent as the other if it is used as a means of deceiving the opposite party. It was error to grant summary judgment where the facts indicated a deliberate concealment of assets with the possible intent to deprive a creditor of those assets. Miller v. Lomax, 266 Ga. App. 93, 596 S.E.2d 232 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Jury was properly instructed on fraud under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-53 because the obligation to communicate to a beneficiary by a trustee was not dictated by the existence of a fiduciary relationship and viable claims for constructive fraud had long been recognized in the absence of a fiduciary relationship under the particular circumstances of the case clause.

<p class="p4">Since the plaintiffs alleged that at the time the plaintiffs purchased the plaintiffs' vehicles, the manufacturer and the distributor failed to disclose to the plaintiffs or to the public the fact that there were underlying safety defects with the gasoline tanks in the models that the plaintiffs purchased, the plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the defendants omitted a material fact that the defendants had a duty to disclose under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-53 as the defects in the gasoline tanks were intrinsic qualities that could not have been discovered through the exercise of ordinary prudence and caution.

<p class="p4"><b>Trust's account statement failed to disclose straw man transaction with trustee.</b> - Trust's account statement reflecting a sale of the principal asset of the trust was not a "report" because there was insufficient disclosure of the nature of the transaction to trigger the running of the shortened two-year limitation period under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-12-307(a).

<p class="p4"><b>Negotiation of stock purchase agreement.</b> - Although the defendants were directors of a corporation, they did not have a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff at the time of the negotiation of a stock purchase agreement; instead, the agreement was an arm's length transaction between persons experienced in the mining business and, therefore, there was no violation of the statute.

<p class="p10"><b>1. Trade Name</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of prior use of trade name.</b> - A person, by long and exclusive use, may acquire a trade name; and when thus acquired, such trade name is as much descriptive of the manufacturer or producer as is his own name, and the infringement of such trade name of an individual will be enjoined by a court of equity when a proper case is made. Womble v. Parker, 208 Ga. 378, 67 S.E.2d 133 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While generic names, geographical names, and names composed of words which are merely descriptive are incapable of exclusive appropriation, words or names which have a primary meaning of their own, such as words descriptive of the goods, service, or place where they are made, or the name of the maker, may nevertheless, by long use in connection with the business of the particular trade, come to be understood by the public as designating the goods, service, or business of a particular trader. Multiple Listing Serv., Inc. v. Metropolitan Multi-List, Inc., 223 Ga. 837, 159 S.E.2d 52 (1968), later appeal, Kidd v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Knowledge of prior use of trade name raises presumption of fraud.</b> - When a person knows of a trade name used by another person, and, notwithstanding this knowledge, uses a similar name in his own business operations, the courts will presume that he has encroached upon the name of the other intentionally and fraudulently. Womble v. Parker, 208 Ga. 378, 67 S.E.2d 133 (1951); Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of prior use of particular color.</b> - While the color of merchandise or its wrapper or container may be one of the important indicia of a fraudulent purpose, if accompanied by other confusing factors such as size, shape, name, printing, or design in the make-up of the article, yet color alone, except possibly where some peculiar and distinctive combination of colors is employed, is not sufficient to establish fraudulent intent, since no one is permitted from the mere prior use of such an all-belonging thing as a color to obtain a monopoly in its use for any particular purpose. Seybold Baking Co. v. Derst Baking Co., 196 Ga. 391, 26 S.E.2d 536 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Testimony of defendant's manager, that he was forced to discontinue less expensive white waxed paper and use more costly "tango" colored cellophane wrapper for his whole wheat bread in order to meet the competition of the plaintiff, could not be taken to establish a fraudulent purpose as a matter of fact, when the act itself did not so indicate, where he also testified that cellophane was a more desirable and more attractive wrapper, and that the color was a more suitable and appropriate transparent wrapper for the brown bread, and where the product was without any other similarities as to the plainly printed labels both inside and outside the wrapper, the ones outside being strikingly different in color.

<p class="p10"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The general purpose of the law controlling trade names and unfair competition is the prevention of fraudulent interference</b> with rights of the lawful holder of a trade name and protection of the public from imposition. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The basic principle of the law of unfair competition is that no one has a right to dress up his goods or business or otherwise represent the same in such a manner as to deceive an intending purchaser and induce him to believe he is buying the goods of another, and that no one has the right to avail himself of another's favorable reputation in order to sell his own goods. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The good will and reputation of a business is as much an asset as its physical properties,</b> and it may as well be the subject of a fraudulent encroachment by an infringer. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, 204 Ga. 209, 49 S.E.2d 19 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An encroachment on the business of another may be made without direct market competition.</b> Gordy v. Dunwody, 209 Ga. 627, 74 S.E.2d 886 (1953), later appeal, 210 Ga. 810, 83 S.E.2d 7 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The words "encroach upon the business of a trader" cannot be said to limit the equitable relief available under this section to those in direct and actual market competition with an alleged infringer or to those cases where it is shown that there has been an actual diversion of trade from one business to another. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, 204 Ga. 209, 49 S.E.2d 19 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>2. Confusing Similarity</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Similarity must confuse the public.</b> - Although the rights in a trade name are exclusive within certain geographical limits, this section does not create rights good against anyone, anywhere. The outer limits are set by the requirement that the plaintiff must show a similarity that is confusing to the public. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While geographical names and words which are merely descriptive are not generally the subject of exclusive appropriation as trade-marks or trade-names, such names and words when used so long and exclusively by a trader, manufacturer, or producer that they are generally understood to designate his business or merchandise, may acquire a secondary signification or meaning indicative not only of the place of manufacture, but of the name of the manufacturer or producer, or of the character of the product, so that the name or title thus employed, including the geographical name and descriptive words, may be the subject of protection against unfair competition in trade, and authorize equity to enjoin a newcomer competitor from the appropriation and use of a trade-name or trade-mark bearing such resemblances to those of the pioneer as to be likely to produce uncertainty and confusion, and to pass off the goods or business of one as those of the other. Womble v. Parker, 208 Ga. 378, 67 S.E.2d 133 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Unless it appears that there is or will probably be a deception of ordinary buyers and the general public into thinking that the goods or business of one is the business or goods of another and thus bring about the sale of one man's goods as the goods of the other, the case is damnum absque injuria for which no action lies. Atlanta Paper Co. v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 184 Ga. 205, 190 S.E. 777 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An infringement upon the real name or trade-name of an individual or corporation is such a colorable imitation of the name that the general public, in the exercise of ordinary care, might think that it is the name of the individual or corporation first appropriating the same. Multiple Listing Serv., Inc. v. Metropolitan Multi-List, Inc., 223 Ga. 837, 159 S.E.2d 52 (1968), later appeal, 225 Ga. 129, 166 S.E.2d 356 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actual confusion.</b> - Promoter presented sufficient evidence of the strength of the promoter's marks and of actual confusion amongst the relevant consumer class to avoid summary judgment, and the appellate court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for the group and remanded for trial on the claims of infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1114, false designation of origin under 15 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1125, deceptive trade practices under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-1-372 and unfair competition under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-55 et seq., because: (1) the car dealership promoter had shown actual confusion and the district court erred by overvaluing lack of confusion exhibited by the general public; (2) "Slash-It! Sales Event" attained federal incontestable status, so the district court erred in holding that the mark was merely descriptive and not entitled to strong protection; (3) the promoter created a disputed issue of material fact that the slasher slogans left the same impression, weighing in favor of likelihood of confusion; and (4) the similarities between the two sales allowed for the inference that a reasonable consumer could possibly attribute the products here to the same source. Caliber Auto. Liquidators, Inc. v. Premier Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, LLC, 605 F.3d 931 (11th Cir. 2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Confusion found.</b> - Summary judgment was inappropriate as to trademark infringement liability and unfair competition claims because while the "Xylem" mark was at least suggestive, the marks were substantially similar, and the trademark holder documented over 100 instances of actual confusion resulting from misdirected checks, phone calls, faxes, and emails, the court could not find that no reasonable juror would find there was no confusion created by the accused infringer's use of the Xylem name and mark. ITT Corp. v. Xylem Group, LLC,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga.

<p class="p10"><b>A. In General</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grant of equitable relief notwithstanding absence of evidence of actual unfair competition authorized.</b> - It is not essential, as a prerequisite to the granting of equitable relief in an action for infringement of a trade name, that actual and direct market competition between the litigants be shown, and that the test as to whether equitable relief is available, should not be limited to those cases where it is shown that there has been an actual diversion of trade from one business to another. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, 204 Ga. 209, 49 S.E.2d 19 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The early common-law rule, and the rule still maintained in some jurisdictions, has been to the effect that there must be shown actual or direct competition between the litigants as an essential prerequisite to relief in an action for infringement of a trade name or unfair trade competition. Under this view, the exclusive test is whether there is a diversion of trade from one business to another, and injury to the good will and reputation of the original user of the trade name, or other injuries as contemplated by the theories of relief afford no basis for equitable relief. Under the modern view, the emphasis is no longer on direct and actual market competition, or diversion of trade from one business to another, but rather on the injury suffered by the complaining party and the public from the confusion resulting from the infringer's acts. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, 204 Ga. 209, 49 S.E.2d 19 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Diversion of trade and the attendant direct loss of sales is not the only injury that may result from infringement of a trade name, but other injuries would necessarily follow, such as an injury to the complaining party's reputation and good will. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, 204 Ga. 209, 49 S.E.2d 19 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff's established infringement of trade name warranting injunction.</b> - Plaintiffs made requisite showing that trade name reacquired upon foreclosure of their security interest had acquired such a secondary meaning and that defaulting buyers knowingly had adopted a confusingly similar name, which had in fact confused plaintiffs' former customers, thus entitling plaintiffs to injunction. Reis v. Ralls, 250 Ga. 721, 301 S.E.2d 40 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>B. "Passing Off" Rule</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The "passing off" rule is sufficient to afford a test as to whether there is unfair competition.</b> The test under this rule is whether the goods or business of one are in fact "passed off" as the goods or business of another, and it has been said, in cases between litigants in actual and direct market competition, that nothing less than such conduct will constitute unfair competition. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, 204 Ga. 209, 49 S.E.2d 19 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Any conduct, the nature and probable tendency and effect of which is to deceive the public so as to pass off the goods or business of one person as and for the goods or business of another, constitutes actionable unfair competition. The essence thereof consists in the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor for those of another. Atlanta Paper Co. v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 184 Ga. 205, 190 S.E. 777 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>C. Intent to Deceive</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Intent to deceive public as basis of unfair competition.</b> - Any conduct, the nature and probable tendency and effect of which is to deceive the public so as to pass off the goods or business of one person as and for the goods or business of another, constitutes actionable unfair competition. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In Georgia, to have a word or words claimed as a trade mark protected by injunction from use by another, it should appear that the defendant's use of them was with intent to deceive or mislead the public. Atlanta Paper Co. v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 184 Ga. 205, 190 S.E. 777 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relief under this section depends upon showing of intent to deceive.</b> However, this intent may be presumed if encroachment is done with knowledge of the prior right. Giant Mart Corp. v. Giant Disct. Foods, Inc., 247 Ga. 775, 279 S.E.2d 683 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Words, acts and conduct prove intent, and are the usual and ordinary means adopted by courts of justice to establish it. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although intent must be found to warrant an injunction, when it comes to finding intent courts look to the effect of a defendant's "words, acts and conduct" and ask the objective questions of whether the plaintiff held an exclusive right to the trade mark or name and whether the defendant encroached upon it. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Injunctive relief cannot be grounded on this section if the court makes no finding of intent to deceive. Giant Mart Corp. v. Giant Disct. Foods, Inc., 247 Ga. 775, 279 S.E.2d 683 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Knowing and willing participant in alteration of cellular telephones.</b> - Because plaintiff cellular telephone trademark holder's complaint properly alleged that defendant competitor was a knowing and willing participant in an enterprise that bought the holder's phones in bulk then altered the phones to circumvent prepaid airtime then resold those phones under the holder's marks, the complaint properly stated claims for unfair competition and deceptive trade practices.

<p class="p4"><b>Transfers of assets before death.</b> - Evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict under the plaintif's theory of fraudulent transfer and civil conspiracy as some evidence authorized the jury to find that a deed conveying the property owner's sole interest to the real property to the owner and one defendant as joint tenants with right of survivorship without any money exchanged prior to death was to evade the plaintiff before a promissory note was paid.

<p class="p4"><b>Fraud in post-nuptial agreements.</b> - After the husband engaged counsel to draw up a formal post-nuptial agreement, and the husband moved to enforce the agreement when the wife filed for divorce, the post-nuptial agreement was unenforceable as the wife testified that the wife signed the agreement because the husband represented to the wife that, if the wife signed the agreement, the husband would understand that the wife loved the husband, and the husband would tear up the agreement; the husband procured the wife's signature on the agreement under the pretense that the agreement would never be enforced and, in fact, that the agreement would be destroyed, and the evidence was sufficient to establish the existence of fraud in procuring the agreement.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of fraud generally.</b> - Since proof of fraud is seldom if ever possible by direct evidence, recourse to circumstantial evidence is a necessity, and there is no kind of action wherein it can be held with greater reason that the fact in issue may be inferred from other facts proved. Durrence v. Durrence, 224 Ga. 620, 163 S.E.2d 740 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rarely, if ever, can a fraudulent intent be shown by direct proof,</b> and where transactions between relatives are under review, slight circumstances are often sufficient to induce belief on the part of the jury that there was fraud between the parties. Bucher v. Murray, 212 Ga. 259, 91 S.E.2d 610 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An attack on a will as having been obtained by undue influence may be supported by a wide range of testimony, since such influence can seldom be shown except by circumstantial evidence. Thus, a confidential relation between the parties, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the disposition of the testator's estate, old age, or disease affecting the strength of the mind, tending to support any other direct testimony or any other proven fact or circumstance going to show the exercise of undue influence on the mind and will of the testator, are relevant. While the quantity of influence varies with the circumstances of each case, according to the relations existing between the parties and the strength or weakness of mind of the testator, the amount of influence necessary to dominate a mind impaired by age or disease may be decidedly less than that required to control a strong mind. Bowman v. Bowman, 205 Ga. 796, 55 S.E.2d 298 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">According to the relations existing between the parties and the strength or weakness of mind of a testator, the amount of influence necessary to dominate a mind impaired by age or disease may be decidedly less than that required to control a strong mind. Fowler v. Fowler, 197 Ga. 53, 28 S.E.2d 458 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the grantor of an "improvident or profuse" deed was not wholly incapable of entering into such a contract, but was possessed of little or no will power and was greatly under the influence of the nephew to whom the deed was executed, an inference of fraud could have been drawn by the jury, and, the evidence for the defendant grantee not being such as to rebut the inference as a matter of law, the court was authorized to charge the jury upon the subject of fraud. Stanley v. Stanley, 179 Ga. 135, 175 S.E. 496 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the broad statement that the conduct of the defendant constituted fraud would be insufficient without an allegation of circumstances from which the court might determine whether the pleader reached the right conclusion in saying that a fraud was committed, still it is not essential to state more facts than may be necessary to carry conviction of the existence of fraud. Wall v. Wall, 176 Ga. 757, 168 S.E. 893 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"Great inadequacy of consideration, joined with great disparity of mental ability in contracting a bargain, may justify equity in setting aside a sale or other contract." Under that principle, a deed may be set aside in equity, on proof to the two elements stated, "without proof of anything else" as to fraud. A fortiori, the same rule would apply with at least equal force in case of such mental disparity and a total absence of consideration. Stow v. Hargrove, 203 Ga. 735, 48 S.E.2d 454 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The evidence showing that a 75-year old woman, uneducated, with neither the ability to read nor write, was dealing with an experienced businessman under circumstances indicating a fraud establishes that there was an imbalance or "disparity of mental ability in contracting a bargain." Top Quality Homes, Inc. v. Jackson, 231 Ga. 844, 204 S.E.2d 600 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Circumstances apparently trivial or almost inconclusive, if separately considered, may by their number and joint operation, especially when corroborated by moral coincidences, be sufficient to constitute conclusive proof. Kelly v. Cubbedge, 143 Ga. App. 830, 240 S.E.2d 162 (1977). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Proof of fraud is seldom, if ever, susceptible of direct proof; thus, recourse to circumstantial evidence usually is required. Brown v. Mann, 237 Ga. App. 247, 514 S.E.2d 922 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In every case slight circumstances must be considered, and may be sufficient to establish the existence of fraud,</b> in transactions between husband and wife fraud might be so completely concealed that creditors could not expose it, and in order that the public might not suffer from such concealment, the law imposes upon the husband and wife the duty of affirmatively establishing their good faith when creditors attack such transactions for fraud. Arrington v. Awbrey, 190 Ga. 193, 8 S.E.2d 648 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where transactions between relatives are under review, slight circumstances are often sufficient to induce belief on the part of a jury that there was fraud or collusion between the parties, and authorize them to find against the claimant and in favor of the plaintiff in fi. fa. A claimant must, generally speaking, come into court with hands unstained by any suggestion of collusion with the defendant in fi. fa. to defeat or defraud the creditors of the latter; and a claimant who fails to make a clear showing of both legal and moral right to the property in dispute must generally suffer the loss thereof at the hands of a jury, if there be any circumstances in proof, even though slight, which may be sufficient to authorize the inference of fraud or collusion. Scruggs v. Blackshear Mfg. Co., 49 Ga. App. 205, 174 S.E. 732 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since fraud is inherently subtle, slight circumstances of fraud may be sufficient to establish a proper case. Brown v. Mann, 237 Ga. App. 247, 514 S.E.2d 922 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of fraud to be of "clear, unequivocal, and decisive" quality.</b> - In a diversity based suit in equity to set aside or deny res judicata effect to a prior state court judgment on the grounds of fraud and mutual mistake, the plaintiffs had to prove their claims by something more than a mere preponderance of the evidence. The evidence had to preponderate in the plaintiffs' favor, but it also had to be of "clear, unequivocal, and decisive" quality. Ahrens v. Katz, 595 F. Supp. 1108 (N.D. Ga. 1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient evidence to create jury issue as to fraud.</b> - See Gibbs v. Jim Wilson Chevrolet Co., 161 Ga. App. 171, 288 S.E.2d 264 (1982); Horne v. Claude Ray Ford Sales, Inc., 162 Ga. App. 329, 290 S.E.2d 497 (1982); Minuteman Press Int'l, Inc. v. Hedrick, 167 Ga. App. 453, 306 S.E.2d 718 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the evidence established that at time automobile was purchased by seller of automobile the certificate of ownership listed 14,229 miles as the car's mileage, that when it was sold by seller to buyer, the odometer read 14,179 miles, and when the buyers test-drove the car the odometer read approximately 7,000 miles, there is considerable conflict regarding the actual mileage of the car, and it is the province of the jury to determine whether seller altered or knew of the alteration of the odometer. Joseph Charles Parrish, Inc. v. Hill, 173 Ga. App. 97, 325 S.E.2d 595 (1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Jury could have found that at least some of the numerous repairs a buyer made to a house after discharging a contractor were to correct defects the contractor passively concealed that the buyer could not have reasonably discerned. Since O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-57 provides that slight circumstances may be sufficient to prove fraud, the contractor was not entitled to a directed verdict in the contractor's favor on the buyer's fraud claim. Lumpkin v. Deventer N. Am., Inc., 295 Ga. App. 312, 672 S.E.2d 405 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a surety because jury questions existed as to whether two subcontractors were the same company, whether an owner acted as an agent on behalf of one of those subcontractors when the owner procured the bonds, and whether the bonds were intentionally written fraudulently based on admissions made by counsel for the surety during the hearing. Choate Constr. Co. v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 318 Ga. App. 682, 736 S.E.2d 443 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence insufficient to go to the jury.</b> - In taxpayers' claim against a purchaser's assignee for rescission of a redemption agreement, the facts did not support rescission. The assignee's attorney did not defraud them or conceal any facts, but advised them to hire an attorney, and any failure to advise them of their legal rights was an opinion as to a matter of law and not a material fact. Boyd v. JohnGalt Holdings, LLC, 294 Ga. 640, 755 S.E.2d 675 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Slight evidence of fraud and undue influence may authorize the jury to cancel the deed.</b> Harper v. Harper, 229 Ga. 583, 193 S.E.2d 616 (1972). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence submitted by both parties on a motion for summary judgment are sufficient to authorize inferences as to fraudulent intent, the issue should be resolved by a jury on a trial, as there is a genuine issue of material fact. Nixon v. Brown, 225 Ga. 811, 171 S.E.2d 512 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence necessary to defeat abusive litigation claim.</b> - In a suit for fraud, misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy allegedly arising out of a real estate transaction, and a counterclaim for abusive litigation, where the record revealed hotly contested versions of what the parties considered to have transpired in the complex real estate transaction, given that the law requires only slight circumstances to establish fraud and conspiracy, the trial judge was authorized to find as a matter of law that the plaintiffs had pierced an essential element of the defendant's abusive litigation claim and were thus entitled to the grant of summary judgment thereon. Seckinger v. Holtzendorf, 200 Ga. App. 604, 409 S.E.2d 76, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 897, 409 S.E.2d 76 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Because there was no evidence of a confidential relationship between a manufacturer and a broker beyond the contractual obligation for the broker to post bonds on behalf of the manufacturer, and the broker did not act on the manufacturer's behalf in any business transactions and was obligated only to secure the posting of the needed bonds, it was nothing more than an arms-length transaction, and the trial court's charge to the jury on agency and fiduciary relationships was error.

<p class="p4"><b>Confidential relationship distinguished from trade secret.</b> - An item may be considered confidential in the context of a business relationship without rising to the level of a trade secret. A confidential relationship is distinguished by the expectations of the parties involved, while a secret is identified through rigorous examination of the information sought to be protected. Roboserve, Ltd. v. Tom's Foods, Inc., 931 F.2d 789 (11th Cir. 1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Whether or not the confidential relationship of partners applies to transactions outside of the scope of the partnership, it does not apply where it appears that the partnership was not in existence at the time of the transaction under consideration.

<p class="p4"><b>Fiduciary relationship must exist.</b> - In order for this Code section to be applicable, a definite fiduciary relationship must exist between plaintiff and the other party.

<p class="p4">Summary judgment was properly granted to the defendants on the plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duties in a partnership venture claim because the plaintiff never argued during the summary judgment phase that a confidential relationship existed between the parties as partners. Laymac v. Kushner, 349 Ga. App. 727, 824 S.E.2d 768 (2019), cert. denied, 2019 Ga. LEXIS 871 (Ga. 2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.</b> - Georgia law does not recognize the tort of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, and a Georgia court faced with the issue would not be likely to create such a cause of action since the imposition of aider and abettor liability for such breaches essentially extends fiduciary obligations beyond the scope of the confidential or special relationship upon which these duties are based. Munford, Inc. v. Munford, 188 Bankr. 860 (N.D. Ga. 1994), aff'd, 97 F.3d 449 (11th Cir. 1996), 97 F.3d 456 (11th Cir. 1996), aff'd on other grounds, 98 F.3d 604 (11th Cir. 1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party to confidential relationship may rely upon representations of other party.</b> - The reason for the rule that a party to a confidential or fiduciary relationship may rely upon representations made is that by the very terms or circumstances of the arrangement of dealings between the parties there rests upon the party acting for another the duty of protecting and furthering the interests of the person for whom he is acting, not those of himself or of any one else. The person so placing trust in him by virtue of this confidential relationship is justified by the situation of this interest in believing that the other party will act fairly and make true representations. Dover v. Burns, 186 Ga. 19, 196 S.E. 785 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to protect confidential information.</b> - Dismissal of the plaintiff's cause of action against a state agency for disclosure of private information for failure to state a cause of action was affirmed because in alleging that the plaintiff gave the agency personal information as a prerequisite to receiving services, with the expectation that it would protect the plaintiff's information, the plaintiff failed to assert in the complaint facts showing that the agency owed the plaintiff a confidential duty to protect that information. McConnell v. Department of Labor, 337 Ga. App. 457, 787 S.E.2d 794 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Therefore, ordinary diligence not required where confidential relationship exists.</b> The numerous decisions to the effect that a party who can read must read, and that fraud which will relieve a party who can read must be such as prevents him from reading, apply to situations where the parties are dealing with each other at arms length, and have no application to a situation where the confidential and fiduciary relation of principal and agent is involved.

<p class="p4">The fact that it is alleged that a plaintiff reposed trust and confidence in the defendant does not create a confidential relationship. In the majority of business dealings opposite parties have trust and confidence in each other's integrity, but there is no confidential relationship by this alone. This state of facts does not bring the plaintiff within the protection of this section. Dover v. Burns, 186 Ga. 19, 196 S.E. 785 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although the plaintiffs offered evidence demonstrating that defendant was their personal friend and had conducted business with them on matters not relating to investments, this evidence is not sufficient to establish a confidential relationship between the parties so as to justify the plaintiffs reposing trust in defendant.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Factual question as to whether confidential relationship existed.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the motion for summary judgment filed by a corporation's general counsel/vice-president because questions of fact existed regarding the existence of a confidential relationship between the general counsel/vice-president and the investors, which were for a jury to decide. Cushing v. Cohen, 323 Ga. App. 497, 746 S.E.2d 898 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

McLendon v. Georgia Kaolin Co., 782 F. Supp. 1548 (M.D. Ga. 1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to a client's breach of fiduciary duty claim, which was not a mere duplication of the legal malpractice claim that was based on the establishment of a fiduciary, attorney-client relationship that was breached, as: (1) material fact issues remained as to whether an attorney-client relationship existed between the client and the attorney; (2) the question of legal malpractice remained an issue; and (3) the client had the right to plead alternative theories, and the jury should be permitted to decide the breach of fiduciary duty claim should they find no attorney-client relationship existed.

Further, none of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct cited by the creditors, Ga.

<p class="p4">Attorney breached fiduciary duties to a bankruptcy debtor since the debtor's reliance on the attorney as a family attorney and the attorney's controlling influence over the debtor established an attorney-client relationship with regard to a real property transaction, and the attorney induced the debtor to execute documents which were not in the debtor's best interests and instead benefitted the attorney and other parties.

<p class="p4"><b>Accountant and client.</b> - When a company sued its accountants for breach of fiduciary duty regarding a sale of the company's assets, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the accountants because the evidence was insufficient to create a factual dispute as to whether the accountants exercised a controlling influence over the will, conduct, and interest of the company, as required under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-58 for a fiduciary relationship to arise.

<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in granting judgment on the pleadings to a bank as to a customer's claim for breach of a duty of confidentiality because the customer failed to assert in the complaint facts showing that the bank owed the customer a confidential duty or invaded the customer's privacy, and the customer did not plead any special circumstances showing that the customer had a particular relationship of trust or mutual confidence with the bank; the bank-customer relationship is not confidential.

<p class="p4">The entire business structure of the parties, their interactions and dealings over the course of several years, and their common goal all furnished a basis for a jury to find a relationship in fact which justified the reposal of confidence on the part of one party and good faith on the part of the others. Vitner v. Funk, 182 Ga. App. 39, 354 S.E.2d 666 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Parties' merger agreement and post-merger relationship did not establish a confidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties since the plaintiff did not exercise sole and exclusive control over the termination of a lease held by the defendant; also, the mere fact that the plaintiff's signature was required on instructions to the escrow agent for the release of escrow funds did not establish a confidential relationship.

<p class="p4"><b>Genuine issues of fact existed as to whether fiduciary duty owed between business people.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the defendants on the part owner's claim for breach of contract because there were genuine questions of fact regarding whether the defendants owed the part owner a fiduciary duty, whether the defendants breached the duty, and whether any breach proximately caused the part owner damage.

<p class="p4"><b>Business relationship.</b> - Trial court erred by denying summary judgment to a subcontractor on the contractor's breach of fiduciary claim because the evidence did not raise an issue of fact regarding the existence of a special agency or any other confidential relationship between the parties as the business relationship was an arms-length one and even adversarial.

<p class="p4">There is little question that a former employee's relationship with the employer was one which required confidence under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-58. The undisputed evidence showed that the employee was intimately involved in the negotiations leading up to and the continuous administration of the contracts with a contractor; not only was the employee responsible for bringing the contractor to the employer, the employee was charged with supervision and inspection of the contractor's contract work.

<p class="p4">On a breach of fiduciary duty claim against a former employee concerning the employee's alleged solicitation of the employee's co-workers, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the employee because, even assuming that the employee had the authority to bind the employer with respect to customer contracts, there was no evidence that the employee had the authority to bind the company on employment matters or relations. Thus, although the employee may have owed the company a fiduciary duty with respect to the customer contracts the employee entered into on its behalf, there was no evidence that the employee occupied a similar confidential relationship with respect to employee relations.

<p class="p4">Evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of criminal attempt to commit theft by taking by a fiduciary as the relationship between the defendant and the employer was merely that of employer-employee because, although the defendant was responsible for creating invoices, the defendant did not have authority to act for the employer beyond weighing the metals and assigning to the weight a dollar amount that had been previously fixed by the employer; and the defendant could not negotiate with the customers or independently determine how much the metals were worth; thus, although the conviction for criminal attempt to commit theft by taking stood, the felony sentence, based on the defendant being a fiduciary, was reversed.

<p class="p4">Business did not have a confidential relationship with a corporation where the parties had similar but separate business objectives that did not merge into a common business objective; the business's insistence on status as a platform company was inconsistent with a confidential relationship because a bid prepared by the business with another company was not evidence of such a relationship, even though the corporation's president was an officer in the other company, as there was no showing that the corporate entities should be disregarded.

<p class="p4">Although a real estate broker, when obtaining for the owner of real estate a tenant for the property, is under no duty, arising out of the relationship to his principal, to guarantee the financial standing of the lessee and the lessee's ability to perform the proposed lease contract, yet where the broker makes a knowingly false representation to his principal, the owner of the property, as to the financial standing of the lessee and the lessee's ability to perform the proposed lease contract, and thereby induces the principal to accept the tenant procured by the broker and to pay to the broker a commission for his services in procuring the tenant, he thereby perpetrates a fraud upon his principal, for which the principal, in a suit against the broker, may recover for the damages sustained. Lyle v. Etheridge, 40 Ga. App. 808, 151 S.E. 531 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It is for the common security of mankind "that gifts procured by agents, and purchases made by them, from their principal, should be scrutinized with a close and vigilant suspicion." Harrison v. Harrison, 214 Ga. 393, 105 S.E.2d 214 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The mere fact that one of the two parties to a contract of sale between them is known to the other to be a real estate broker, when the broker is not acting as the agent for the buyer but is himself the seller of the property, will fail to show a fiduciary relationship. Lewis v. Alderman, 117 Ga. App. 855, 162 S.E.2d 440 (1968). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Answer, alleging that the plaintiff broker misrepresented the financial ability of the buyer, that is, that the buyer was ready, willing and able to buy on the terms stipulated by the seller, thereby inducing the defendant to accept the buyer's offer and to enter into a contract which the buyer was unable to perform, set out a breach of the broker's duty of exercising the utmost good faith toward his principal, the seller, which was a defense to the broker's action for commissions. Reisman v. Massey, 84 Ga. App. 796, 67 S.E.2d 585 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Where cotenant was a relative to the other heirs and acted as agent for the purchaser of land during the sale, the agent's confidential relationship with the other heirs was imputed to the purchaser; and a jury could find that the purchaser, through the agent's confidential relationship with the other heirs, was so situated as to exercise a controlling influence over the will, conduct, and interest of the other heirs.

<p class="p4"><b>Insurance agent and insured.</b> - A confidential relationship did not exist between an insured and his agent which would have enabled the insured to place trust and reliance on oral representations by the agent, inconsistent with the terms of the form. The mere fact that one reposes trust and confidence in another does not create a confidential relationship. Trulove v. Woodmen of World Life Ins. Soc'y, 204 Ga.

<p class="p4">The fact that the plaintiff and the defendant are brothers does not of itself create a confidential or fiduciary relation between them. If such relation exists between brothers, it must be shown by proof, and the burden is upon the party asserting the existence of such relationship to affirmatively show the same. Hancock v.

<p class="p4">While the fact that the plaintiff and the decedent were brother and sister would not of itself create a confidential or fiduciary relationship between them solely because they were so related, plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to charge the existence of a confidential relationship between them requiring the utmost good faith and fair dealings on his part.

<p class="p4"><b>Tenants in common.</b> - Purchaser of land had no duty to disclose its knowledge of a kaolin deposit to seller by virtue of its relationship as a tenant in common, since the confidential relationship between cotenants does not extend to encompass the circumstance of one tenant purchasing another cotenant's interest.

<p class="p4"><b>Purchaser of property and real estate investing company.</b> - Since plaintiff's decision to buy property was based on plaintiff's confidence that it could be used in the way defendant suggested and that defendant would rent the property on plaintiff's behalf as defendant agreed to do, a jury issue existed regarding whether the parties were in a confidential relationship at the time of the alleged fraud.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Resident.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a homeowners' association summary judgment on a resident's claim of breach of fiduciary duty because the resident's mere reliance upon status as a resident of the development, without more, failed to establish a fiduciary or confidential relationship.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Investors and bank.</b> - Breach of fiduciary duty action filed by two investors against a bank was dismissed by summary judgment because, according to the terms of an investment agreement, there was no such relationship between the parties; further, there was no evidence that the bank exercised a controlling influence over the investors' will, conduct, or interests nor did the investors establish that they relied upon the bank to make decisions on their behalf.

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of breach by trustee shown to survive summary judgment.</b> - In a trustee's suit against a company and the company's manager for interfering with trust assets, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the company and the company's manager on the trustee's breach of fiduciary claim because the evidence showed that they unilaterally transferred the trust's property interest and, although the transfer was deemed invalid, the trust's interest was invaded, creating a jury question as to injury and resulting damage, either actual or nominal.

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of confidential relationship raises presumption of undue influences.</b> - Where evidence is presented of a confidential relationship, the grantor being of weaker mentality and the grantee occupying the dominant position, an issue of fact is raised as to undue influence. Fletcher v. Fletcher, 242 Ga. 158, 249 S.E.2d 530 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While a mere allegation of weakness of mind not amounting to imbecility is not sufficient to set forth a cause of action for cancellation of a deed, there being no allegation of fraud or undue influence, nevertheless, where the mental weakness is pronounced, such as would prevent the grantor from understanding the nature of his act at the time the deed was executed and especially where as alleged such mental impairment is united with alleged undue and controlling influence on the part of one occupying a confidential relationship with the illiterate grantor, it will authorize a cancellation on the ground of fraud. Mullins v. Barrett, 204 Ga. 11, 48 S.E.2d 842 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the evidence and the pleadings show that the deceased was an infirm and aged woman, suffering from a brain tumor, whose mental and physical condition declined during the last years of her life, weakened by the damage to her brain by the illness from which she died, and that the defendants stood in a confidential and fiduciary capacity to her, whereby they administered her medicines to her and cared for her in her illness, took care of her personal business, hired nurses for her, cared for her in their home, and she changed her bank account to make it a joint one with her nephew, one of the defendants, there arose a presumption of undue influence, and the court should have charged on undue influence and the shifting of the burden of proof, and erred in failing to charge thereon. McGahee v. Walden, 216 Ga. 352, 116 S.E.2d 559 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in giving a jury instruction that stated that the jury could infer that undue influence existed if it found a confidential relationship was present; the testator made a gift of realty, and the testator was in a weakened mental state and feeble-minded, so the jury was entitled under those circumstances to presume, not merely infer, that undue influence had been shown. White v. Regions Bank, 275 Ga. 38, 561 S.E.2d 806 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence presented by a testator's child, which proved the testators's disease, medication, and its effects, the testator's dependence on the care givers, their isolation of the testator from the child; their active encouragement and arrangements for the drafting and execution of a new will, the testator's short-term relationship with them, the testator's sporadic contact with and lack of trust towards one of the challenged beneficiaries, and the testator's long-standing expressions of testamentary intent to leave all of the testator's property to the child, which the testator repeated the day after execution of the disposition, supplied sufficient evidence to support the child's claim of undue influence to support the jury verdict in the child's favor and not a directed verdict entered by the trial court in the face of this evidence; although this evidence did not demand a finding that the will was the product of undue influence, it was sufficient to authorize the submission of that question to the jury. Bailey v. Edmundson, 280 Ga. 528, 630 S.E.2d 396 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A trial court correctly denied an executor's motion for directed verdict in an action wherein the child of the testator filed a caveat and objection to the probate of the testator's last will and testament on the grounds that the will was the product of undue influence as sufficient evidence existed to support the conclusion that undue influence was used to have the testator bequeath the only asset, namely a home, to the caregiver who was hired by the executor. The record established that the executor blocked calls from the testator's child, refused to let the child see the testator, and a confidential relationship was established between the caregiver and the testator as the caregiver took an active role in the planning, preparation, and execution of the will.

<p class="p4"><b>To determine whether equity will set aside an award for fraud, </b><span class="s1"><b>§§</b></span><b> 23-2-54 and 23-2-60 must be construed together.</b> Tinsley v. Maddox, 176 Ga. 471, 168 S.E. 297 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fraud will authorize a court of equity to set aside a written instrument.</b> Lanning v. Sockwell, 137 Ga. App. 479, 224 S.E.2d 119 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the failure to perform the promised act is coupled with the present intention not to perform, fraud, in the legal sense, is present. This is known as inceptive fraud, and is sufficient to support an action for cancellation of a written instrument. Hinson v. Hinson, 221 Ga. 291, 144 S.E.2d 381 (1965); Lanning v. Sockwell, 137 Ga. App. 479, 224 S.E.2d 119 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where it is alleged that the sole consideration for the execution of the deed from the grantor to the grantee is the promise of the grantees to support, maintain, provide, and care for a third party, and that this promise is made by the grantees fraudulently and for the purpose of securing the signature of the grantor, to the conveyance, and that the grantees never intend to comply with their agreement, the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action on the ground of inceptive fraud. Bucher v. Christopher, 211 Ga. 317, 85 S.E.2d 760 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Any representation, act, or artifice intended to deceive, and which does deceive another, is such a fraud as may authorize cancellation of a written contract, but a party to a contract who can read must read or show a legal excuse for not doing so, and ordinarily, if fraud is the excuse, it must be such fraud as prevents the party from reading; nor in such case will a mere fraudulent statement by the opposite party or his agent as to the contents of the writing furnish a legal excuse. And where the contract is a deed to land, the rule will generally apply to the grantee as well as the grantor. Livingston v. Barnett, 193 Ga. 640, 19 S.E.2d 385 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A cancellation obtained by fraud or mistake without payment may itself be canceled by equity. Grimmett v. Barnwell, 184 Ga. 461, 192 S.E. 191 (1937); Lanning v. Sockwell, 137 Ga. App. 479, 224 S.E.2d 119 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the execution of the contract was merely one of the incidents or stages by which the deed plaintiff sought to cancel was procured, evidence tending to show that the contract itself was procured by fraud was admissible for the purpose of canceling the deed. Morton v. Wallace, 177 Ga. 856, 171 S.E. 720 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the terms of an absolute deed cannot be varied by limiting the grantee to a use of the land in a manner not restricted by the express terms of the deed, it may nevertheless be alleged and proved that it was induced by fraud, without denying or varying any of the stipulations or conditions contained in the deed. Bucher v. Christopher, 211 Ga. 317, 85 S.E.2d 760 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where land is owned by two persons, and one obtains a deed from the other to his interest by means of an intentionally false and fraudulent promise to sell the land at its true value and pay off an encumbrance and account for the balance, or failing to find a purchaser, he will procure a new loan to discharge the present encumbrance, and after obtaining the title he retains and claims the property as absolutely his own, this transaction by which the ownership is obtained is such a fraud as will entitle the grantor to have the deed canceled. Smith v. Merck, 206 Ga. 361, 57 S.E.2d 326 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Equity will grant relief where the transfer of a valuable property has been fraudulently extorted, for a grossly inadequate consideration, from a person while in such a state of intoxication as to render him incapable of transacting business. Ealy v. Tolbert, 209 Ga. 575, 74 S.E.2d 867, later appeal, 210 Ga. 96, 78 S.E.2d 26 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a party at the time of entering into a contract or executing an instrument is intoxicated to such a degree as to deprive him of his reason and to disqualify his mind to apprehend the nature of his act and its probable consequences, a court of equity may grant relief by rescission and cancellation. McKaig v. Hardy, 196 Ga. 582, 27 S.E.2d 11 (1943); Ealy v. Tolbert, 209 Ga. 575, 74 S.E.2d 867, later appeal, 210 Ga. 96, 78 S.E.2d 26 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As against one who by fraud during the lifetime of deceased husband induced the latter to execute to him a deed to realty, equity will afford the widow, as personal representative, a remedy to cancel and set aside the deed and incidentally to preserve and apply rents issuing from such realty. Ealy v. Tolbert, 209 Ga. 575, 74 S.E.2d 867, later appeal, 210 Ga. 96, 78 S.E.2d 26 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity has jurisdiction to reform written instruments where there has been a mistake</b> on the part of one of the parties, accompanied by fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of the other party, just as in cases where there is a mutual mistake. Thompson v. Thompson, 203 Ga. 128, 45 S.E.2d 632 (1947); Wellborn v. Johnson, 204 Ga. 389, 50 S.E.2d 16 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Petition contained sufficient allegations to show mistake on the part of the petitioner and fraud on the part of her own attorney, known to the attorney for the husband, and alleged a cause of action for reformation of contract between the parties and for modification of the judgment in the divorce suit accordingly. Thompson v. Thompson, 203 Ga. 128, 45 S.E.2d 632 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The general rule that an infant is bound by a judgment rendered in a suit in which he is represented by a next friend,</b> to the same extent as though he were an adult, is subject to an exception in case of fraud, collusion, or like conduct on the part of the next friend, in which case the judgment may be set aside at the instance of the minor, even though it may be a consent judgment. Nelson v. Estill, 190 Ga. 235, 9 S.E.2d 73 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A decree adversely affecting the interests of minors, even though it be entered by consent of their father as next friend, may, if induced by fraud, duress, or the like, be set aside at their instance in a proper proceeding, and for that purpose they may sue by their mother as next friend. Nelson v. Estill, 190 Ga. 235, 9 S.E.2d 73 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>As between the original parties thereto, fraud in its procurement voids a contract,</b> and this upon the theory that, the consent of the parties being necessary to the binding force of a contract, if one, apparently consenting by the execution of a written contract, can show that he did not in fact consent to its terms as therein expressed, but that his apparent consent was induced by false and fraudulent practices, by means of which he was overreached by the other party, and, without negligence upon his own part, really deceived as to the terms of the contract, he would be entitled to be relieved from its apparent obligations.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An accounting may be had at law.</b> - The mere necessity of accounting to ascertain the amount due on a contract is insufficient to give equity jurisdiction to order an accounting. Insurance Ctr., Inc. v. Hamilton, 218 Ga. 597, 129 S.E.2d 801 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Therefore, an equitable accounting is not a proceeding to which every litigant has a right.</b> It is granted only in carefully prescribed and determined circumstances, such as when an accounting at law is inadequate, and when the relationships and dealings between the parties are as set forth in this section. Herring v. Standard Guar. Ins. Co., 238 Ga. 261, 232 S.E.2d 544 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An equitable accounting is evidentiary in nature</b> but the determination that an equitable accounting will be ordered is an interlocutory or preliminary matter separate and distinct from the equitable accounting itself. Herring v. Standard Guar. Ins. Co., 238 Ga. 261, 232 S.E.2d 544 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right to attorney fees.</b> - Because there were no excess proceeds from the foreclosure sale to which a condominium association would have been entitled, and regardless of whether it was the owner of the condominium at the time of the foreclosure it was not entitled to an equitable accounting, the association was also properly denied attorney fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 resulting from the bank's failure to provide an equitable accounting. Riverview Condo. Ass'n v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB, 285 Ga. App. 7, 645 S.E.2d 5 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1254, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 705 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This section contemplates only petitions in equity involving the traditional filing of the action</b> and the issuance and service of process. Bodrey v. Bodrey, 225 Ga. 822, 171 S.E.2d 614 (1969), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Wiley v. Wiley, 233 Ga. 824, 213 S.E.2d 682 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hence, equity does not have jurisdiction merely because the application for partition prays for an accounting</b> as to common grantors where there was no filing of an action and summons and process. Bodrey v. Bodrey, 225 Ga. 822, 171 S.E.2d 614 (1969), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Wiley v. Wiley, 233 Ga. 824, 213 S.E.2d 682 (1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Where a fiduciary relation exists, an accounting in equity is proper.</b> Atlanta Trust Co. v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 761, 4 S.E.2d 644 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>So, where petitioners, remainder legatees under their mother's will, sued defendant in three different capacities,</b> namely, as trustee for the life estate under the will, as executrix, and as an individual, seeking an injunction against the sale of realty of the estate, partition, judgment, an accounting, and other and further relief, petitioners were entitled to an accounting. Matson v. Crowe, 193 Ga. 578, 19 S.E.2d 288 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In a proceeding to obtain an accounting, the complainant is not obliged to show how much is due,</b> provided he avers facts sufficient to indicate that something will be found to be due him by the defendant. Atlanta Trust Co. v. National Bondholders Corp., 188 Ga. 761, 4 S.E.2d 644 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An injunction may be granted to continue during an accounting.</b> Henderson v. Turner, 36 Ga. 263 (1867).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action for accounting pending in court of law not automatically subject to injunction by filing equitable action.</b> - Where it appears from a petition praying for an accounting that there was pending in another court an action by the corporate defendant against the plaintiff, such court being empowered to render an accounting between the parties, and no special reason being set out why a court of equity should assume jurisdiction for such purpose, equity will not enjoin the proceedings and processes of a court of law in the absence of some intervening equity or other proper defense of which the party, without fault on his part, cannot avail himself at law. Peeples v. Peeples, 193 Ga. 358, 18 S.E.2d 629 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>There must be some special reason why a court proceeding in equity should take charge of an action</b> where an accounting is requested, the petition must show, and this means more than the mere assertion of a conclusion, some reason why the remedy at law is inadequate. Peeples v. Peeples, 193 Ga. 358, 18 S.E.2d 629 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When transfer of accounting case from Supreme Court to Court of Appeals mandatory.</b> - A suit for an accounting case, on appeal, must be transferred to the Court of Appeals from the Supreme Court, where the alleged facts show no unusual complication in the transactions or other ground for equitable relief additional to the relief which might be afforded by an accounting and judgment at law. Universal Garage Co. v. Fowler, 184 Ga. 604, 192 S.E. 299 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Borrower was not entitled to an equitable accounting because the borrower failed to allege facts sufficient to show that the borrower lacked an adequate remedy at law to ascertain the amount due on the borrower's loan.

<p class="p4"><b>Relationship of joint tort-feasors required for right to contribution.</b> - In an action by tenants' insurers against suppliers of building materials for losses due to fire damage to the building, the suppliers did not have a right to contribution from the landlord since the tenants and the landlord had agreed in leases not to sue each other before for losses covered by insurance; thus, no cause of action by the insurers against the landlord ever arose and the landlord could not be a joint tort-feasor with the suppliers.

<p class="p4"><b>While the doctrine of contribution originated in courts of equity, it was subsequently adopted by courts of law</b> and is now universally applied therein. In order to make the doctrine consistent with the forms, theories, and practices of courts of law, the fiction of an implied contract by one obligor to contribute to another coobligor who had been compelled to pay the whole obligation was adopted. Watkins v. Woodbery, 148 Ga. 249, 96 S.E. 338 (1918); Powell v. Powell, 171 Ga. 840, 156 S.E. 677 (1931), later appeal, 179 Ga. 817, 117 S.E. 566 (1934); Black v. Davidson, 65 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Hence, surety cannot obtain a joint and general judgment against cosureties for contributions.</b> - There is no authority for the proposition that a surety or other coobligor, however he may find his action for contribution, may obtain a joint and several judgment against his several cosureties for the aggregate amount due him.

<p class="p4"><b>Contribution limited to proportionate share of whole obligation.</b> - If there be several guarantors, some of whom have paid off the obligation, their right against the remaining guarantors, or persons secondarily liable, is only for contribution as to the proportionate share of the whole.

<p class="p4"><b>When contribution against tort-feasors not available.</b> - Where separate judgments are entered against tort-feasors whose concurrent, independent negligence results in damage to the plaintiff's property, the verdict and judgment against each tort-feasor adjudicates the amount of his liability. In such circumstances there is no right of contribution between the tort-feasors. The right of contribution under the law is based upon one party bearing more than his share of "a common burden."

<p class="p4"><b>And, when contribution not available in partnership.</b> - Where the business of a copartnership entails loss and where no part of the copartnership debts has been paid, no right of contribution arises, and no right to setoff partnership liabilities against a suit on a note by one of the partners against the other partners.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When superior court's equitable powers exercisable.</b> - Where affirmative defense to action is beyond jurisdiction of city or county court in which it was filed, and plaintiff in that court is nonresident or insolvent so that failure to adjudicate counterclaim urged by original defendant along with main case could result in unfair advantage, superior court may exercise its equitable powers by enjoining suit originally filed and taking cognizance of entire controversy in a single action.

<p class="p4"><b>However, insolvency and nonresidence are not the sole grounds of equitable setoff; they are illustrative,</b> but not all-comprehensive, of such grounds and an equitable setoff will be allowed, although the amount is small, and although the party may have a remedy at law, if to recover that small amount he is driven to many suits and to much trouble and expense.

<p class="p4"><b>Setoff as not defeating plaintiff's claim, regardless of legal or equitable nature of setoff.</b> - Existence of valid right of setoff does not operate to defeat plaintiff's claim, although it might preclude his recovery of any actual damages; and this is true regardless of the assertion of the setoff as a legal right or an equitable right. National City Bank v. Busbin, 175 Ga. App. 103, 332 S.E.2d 678 (1985); Gynecologic Oncology v. Weiser, 212 Ga. App. 858, 443 S.E.2d 526 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setoff improper.</b> - Trial court erred in ruling for a development company in the company's declaratory judgment action seeking to have the company's debt to a bank set off against the company's loan to a holding company because the bank and the holding company were separate entities; the development company knew the risks involved when the company made the holding company loan, and the bank could not obtain relief unavailable to any other entities who lent money to the holding company simply because the company borrowed money from the bank years ago.

<p class="p4"><b>Voluntary rent provision and debt payment.</b> - Defendant's claim that she satisfied her debt on a promissory note owed to her spouse by providing her mother-in-law with a rent-free apartment and by paying certain debts that spouse owed to certain creditors was to no avail as it was done under a mere volunteer arrangement with no outstanding obligations to do so.

<p class="p4"><b>A city court has no jurisdiction whatever to entertain a plea setting up an equitable setoff,</b> or an equitable right of setoff, for the simple reason that to entertain such a plea it is necessary for the court, not only to recognize an equitable right, but to give affirmative relief as a result of such recognition.

Hamrick, 206 Ga. 564, 58 S.E.2d 145 (1950); Turner v. Turner, 210 Ga. 586, 82 S.E.2d 137 (1954); Gaines v. Johnson, 216 Ga. 668, 119 S.E.2d 28 (1961); L.L. Minor Co. v.

<p class="p4">Trial court's denial of a petition brought by heirs of a decedent's estate seeking partition and sale of estate property by a special master was affirmed where the trial court found that the interests of the heirs were adequately protected in the probate court so that the intervention of equity was not warranted; the heirs failed to meet their obligation of demonstrating a strong reason for the intervention of equity into the administration of the estate.

<p class="p4"><b>Proceeding against administrator, etc., for settlement of estate not interference with regular administration of estate.</b> - A proceeding brought against an administrator or executor for a settlement by an heir at law or legatee is not such interference with the regular administration of estates as is denounced by this section. The jurisdiction of a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a superior court in respect to bringing proceedings for an account and settlement is co-ordinate and equal, and has always been so in this state. The jurisdiction conferred upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the management and distribution of estates does not oust the jurisdiction of equity in matters of settlement. Terry v. Chandler, 172 Ga. 715, 158 S.E. 572 (1931); Stroup v. Imes, 185 Ga. 422, 195 S.E. 411 (1938); Robinson v. Georgia Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 185 Ga. 688, 196 S.E. 395 (1938); Manry v.

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence necessary for court to replace administrator or executor with receiver.</b> - A superior court will not interfere with the regular course of an administrator, by appointing a receiver to take the assets of the estate out of the hands of the administrator, unless the danger is imminent and the charges in the complaint are positive and specific. Griner v. Wilson, 181 Ga. 432, 182 S.E. 592 (1935); Furr v. Jordan, 196 Ga. 862, 27 S.E.2d 861 (1943); Salter v. Salter, 209 Ga. 511, 74 S.E.2d 241 (1953); Rainey v.

<p class="p4"><b>When accounting premature equitable jurisdiction not sustainable on showing imminent danger of loss.</b> - While it would now appear that there are decisions holding that ordinarily an equitable petition for an accounting against an administrator may be maintained without the necessity of showing imminent danger of loss, where it does not appear that the court of ordinary (now probate court) has already assumed jurisdiction for the purpose of an accounting, this rule will not be extended to a case which shows plainly that an accounting would be premature.

<p class="p4"><b>Equity jurisdiction not available because adequate legal remedy.</b> - Where devisee brings equitable complaint against coexecutors of an estate, seeking a partition of the property of the estate through a sale by the receiver, and alleging that more than 20 years had elapsed since the executors had qualified, that all the debts of the estate had been paid, and that executors were in possession of all real and personal property belonging to the estate, the allegations are insufficient to authorize the grant of the prayers for equitable complaint between the devisees because plaintiff devisee has a full and adequate remedy under the law in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to require executors to distribute the estate by division or partition.

<p class="p4"><b>But a person may not seek intervention of equity as a means of wrenching administration of the estate from the jurisdiction of the court of ordinary</b> (now probate court). Jones v. Head, 185 Ga. 857, 196 S.E. 725 (1938); Conner v. Yawn, 200 Ga. 500, 37 S.E.2d 541 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact that an executor is serving without bond is insufficient to show a danger of loss or injury</b> in the absence of interference by a court of equity. Taylor v. Taylor, 205 Ga. 483, 53 S.E.2d 769 (1949); Fuller v. Fuller, 217 Ga. 691, 124 S.E.2d 741 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actions outside scope of equitable jurisdiction of courts.</b> - The superior courts are not ordinarily empowered on equitable complaint to set aside a previous probate of a will by a court of ordinary (now probate court), or to pass upon the validity of a will, or to interfere with due administration already in progress in a court of ordinary, or to do more than determine the legality or proper construction of particular legacies. Abercrombie v. Hair, 185 Ga. 728, 196 S.E. 447 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One clear exception to this section is where fraud has been or is being committed by the executor.</b> In such cases it is deemed that the only complete and adequate remedy to which the heirs, legatees, or devisees may be entitled can only be afforded by a court exercising equitable jurisdiction. King v. King, 225 Ga. 142, 166 S.E.2d 347 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hence, where a legatee alleges fraud, and seeks cancellation and rescission of a deed</b> executed by the defendant executor conveying property belonging to the estate to the executor's wife, the superior court is authorized to take necessary action for the complete and just administration of the estate in one action. King v. King, 225 Ga. 142, 166 S.E.2d 347 (1969).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of fraud needed for superior court to set aside judgment of probate court.</b> - However, "the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be set aside by a decree in equity, for fraud, accident, or mistake." The fraud in the procurement of such a judgment must have been actual and positive, done with knowledge, and not merely constructive fraud, committed in ignorance of the true facts. Thus a superior court may set aside as void a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) appointing an administrator where "an allegation of fact in a petition of the court of ordinary (now probate court), which was necessary to give the court jurisdiction, was known by the petitioner to be false, and therefore was fraud upon the court." Abercrombie v. Hair, 185 Ga. 728, 196 S.E. 447 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Waste, mismanagement and insolvency of bondless executor sufficient for grant of equitable relief.</b> - Where the plaintiff, a distributee of an estate in the hands of an executor alleged to be insolvent and without bond, alleges facts which show waste and mismanagement, and a situation is presented where he would be remediless unless granted the relief which a superior court alone can grant, he is a party interested in the estate, and alleges facts showing danger of loss, thus bringing himself within the exception mentioned in this section. Walters v. Suarez, 188 Ga. 190, 3 S.E.2d 575 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limited use of paragraph (2) exception.</b> - Paragraph (2) of this section is not intended, in the absence of any allegation of fraud, to supply a means of reviewing a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the administration of an estate of which it has assumed jurisdiction, or of ousting the jurisdiction of the court of ordinary (now probate court). Darby v. Green, 174 Ga. 146, 162 S.E. 493 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If an insolvent executor in charge of real estate which includes houses which need repairs, no matter however small, and he, being without sufficient funds to make them, fails to do so, and on this account the property is deteriorating, the persons to whom the property has been devised are entitled to have the same protected, and the appointment of a receiver with directions to him to have the repairs made, seems not to be an inappropriate remedy. Jones v. Proctor, 195 Ga. 607, 24 S.E.2d 779 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action alleging denial of information needed by widow for determining to take under will or by election maintainable in equity.</b> - Where wife of the deceased testator alleges that the executor refuses to give her any information concerning the money or property belonging to the estate, which information she must have in order to determine the question whether or not to accept a bequest contained in the will in lieu of dower and a year's support, widow was a "person interested in the estate" and entitled to maintain action in equity against executor. Jackson v. Jackson, 206 Ga. 470, 57 S.E.2d 602 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And, where minor children of testator participate in the residue of the estate after specific bequests have been satisfied,</b> and all persons provided for in the will with the exception of the children were granted their legacies in the probate court, children qualified under statute as "person interested in estate," and were entitled to appointment of receiver to restrain executor and others from disposing of estate property. Jackson v. Jackson, 206 Ga. 470, 57 S.E.2d 602 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absent complaint from estate representative proof needed to sustain complaint of persons interested in estate.</b> - This provision requires a determination of whether plaintiffs, as persons interested in the estate because they are parties to a testamentary agreement, made sufficient allegations as to "danger of loss or other injury to their interests" when there is no application from the representative. Fuller v. Fuller, 217 Ga. 691, 124 S.E.2d 741 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where the interested party's allegations amount to apprehension of injury, this has been held insufficient</b> as a basis for injunction and interference with administration of estates. Fuller v. Fuller, 217 Ga. 691, 124 S.E.2d 741 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Preventing irreparable injury to estate sufficient ground for intervention by superior court.</b> - Where complainant did not seek removal of the defendant as an executor under <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-32, nor that he be required to make bond under <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-148 but sought a restraining order to prevent the defendant from making contracts on behalf of the estate, and paying out funds belonging to the estate, without the concurrence of the complainants, which could not be granted by the ordinary (now probate judge) and which was contrary to the provisions of <span class="s1">§</span> 53-7-5, the allegations of the complaint show the necessity of the intervention of a court of equitable jurisdiction in order to prevent irreparable injury to the estate. Saffold v. Cheatham, 221 Ga. 155, 143 S.E.2d 629 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Interest in the estate."</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-91(2), heirs at law, although not beneficiaries under a purported will, have a statutory "interest in the estate" to allow them standing to petition the superior court for equitable relief; "interest in the estate" in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-91(2), includes equitable redress in the superior court when adequate relief is otherwise unavailable.

<p class="p4"><b>This section is within one of the exceptions stated in </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>23-2-91. But where the duty of the executor is clear, equity will not interfere. Adams v. Dixon, 19 Ga. 513, 65 Am. Dec. 608 (1856); Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Neither this section nor </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 23-2-93 declares that an injunction must be granted;</b> the propriety of this relief will depend upon the facts of each particular case, and the general principles of equity as related to injunction.

<p class="p4">In action filed by executors in equity to marshal assets, and for direction, and to enjoin creditors, heirs, and legatees, named as defendants, from instituting any independent action with reference to the matters referred to in the petition, under the pleadings and the evidence the court did not err in refusing to grant an injunction. Hudson v. Tate, 188 Ga. 707, 4 S.E.2d 577 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Because, only the representative of an estate may ask direction of the court</b> in cases of difficulty in construing wills, or in distributing estates, in ascertaining the persons entitled, or in determining under what law property should be divided, and such direction may not be invoked by a legatee. Jackson v. Callahan, 152 Ga. 236, 109 S.E. 499 (1921); Palmer v. Neely, 162 Ga. 767, 135 S.E. 90 (1926); McLarty v. Abercrombie, 168 Ga. 742, 149 S.E. 30 (1929); Campbell v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An executor may bring a complaint for construction of a will although the executor may be a legatee thereunder.</b> Watts v. Finley, 187 Ga. 629, 1 S.E.2d 723 (1939); Barker v. Wilkinson, 222 Ga. 329, 149 S.E.2d 698 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The court might entertain an action by executors for direction, and still appoint receivers to execute directions</b> given therein; the two powers of the court are given equal recognition in the Code, and are not antagonistic, but are coordinate and consistent. Benton v. Turk, 188 Ga. 710, 4 S.E.2d 580 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And a widow can maintain action against her coexecutors in her representative capacity as executrix, but not in her individual capacity</b> as legatee, widow and sole heir at law of testator; she can maintain action as executrix even though, since she has a manifest interest in the subject matter of the action, a decree will also adjudicate her claim as legatee, widow and heir at law. Armstrong v. Merts, 202 Ga. 483, 43 S.E.2d 512 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>However, legatee authorized to bring action upon showing of sufficient interest in estate and necessity for court's direction.</b> - Where legatee sought by her complaint and was entitled to injunctive relief against the executor to prevent a premature distribution of the assets of the estate contrary to the directions of the will, and alleged that the executor had misconstrued the will, legatee's complaint showed such interest by the legatee in the estate and such necessity for construction of the will and direction by the court to protect her distributive share and legacy as would authorize her to bring the action. Barfield v. Aiken, 209 Ga. 483, 74 S.E.2d 100 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hence, a creditor of a beneficiary of a will cannot</b> bring a complaint for construction. Jackson v. Callahan, 152 Ga. 236, 109 S.E. 499 (1921). Nor can a legatee. Maneely v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equitable interference not available to remainderman when life tenant still in life.</b> - Where the only title which, under the petition, could inure to claimants by virtue of the wills of third persons consisted of an alleged remainder interest after the death of a person still in life, and they would have no cause of action to recover the property before the death of such life tenant, <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-91 governing equitable interference with the administration of estates does not authorize such an action. Smith v. Pitchford, 189 Ga. 307, 5 S.E.2d 766 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Executor's uncertainity justified judgment action.</b> - Executor of the estate and partnership head faced uncertainty with respect to conflicting duties to the partnership and to the estate and beneficiaries; thus, a declaratory judgment was an appropriate vehicle to clarify the executor's obligations, and the Georgia superior court had concurrent jurisdiction with the probate court to address those issues as well as was authorized to exercise the court's concurrent and equitable jurisdiction to decide the requests for the temporary restraining orders. Rentz v. Rentz, 339 Ga. App. 66, 793 S.E.2d 112 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>However, a person who claims an interest in the estate, not arising under the will, is not a party</b> to a complaint for direction. Bond v. Connelly, 8 Ga. 302 (1850).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where interveners are not claiming under the will but, their claim is antagonistic to the will,</b> and they are claiming under the will of another, then the issue presents none of the questions included within the provisions of this section. Phillips v. Kelly, 176 Ga. 111, 167 S.E. 281 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A superior court will not construe a will when requested by the executor "on imaginary difficulties or from excessive caution."</b> Venable v. Dallas, 212 Ga. 595, 94 S.E.2d 416 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Therefore, complaint seeking a declaratory judgment, which shows that the complainant was not uncertain or insecure as to his asserted rights as executor as against the claim of a legatee, was properly dismissed on demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Venable v. Dallas, 212 Ga. 595, 94 S.E.2d 416 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">However, where one item of a will contained a bequest of "twenty thousand ($20,000.00) dollars," and another item a bequest to the "University Hospital of Augusta, Georgia," there being no such legal entity in the said city, the executors of such will were authorized to bring in a superior court a complaint seeking construction and direction. Moss v. Youngblood, 187 Ga. 188, 200 S.E. 689 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Also, a superior court will not assume jurisdiction of an estate and obstruct the procedure for the administration</b> of an estate under the guise of construing the will. Bandy v. Smith, 211 Ga. 192, 84 S.E.2d 449 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Actions not countenanced from executor.</b> - An executor who seeks the aid of a superior court and invokes a construction of the will with whose execution he has been charged by a testator will not be heard to retract his statement that the will requires construction, and mend his hold by contending, in substance, that the contents of the will are so plain as to require no construction, nor can an executor in such circumstances advocate or promote the interest of any party other than himself, in any litigation involving the construction of the will. McAfee v. Board of Firemasters, 186 Ga. 262, 197 S.E. 802 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Complexity arising from agreement growing out of widow's application for dower was sufficient to sustain a complaint</b> under this section. Hill v. Clark, 48 Ga. 526 (1873).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If a widow is entitled to a year's support, there is no cause, legal or equitable, for delaying enjoyment</b> of this right; and if it cannot be asserted against the executor, he can defend himself at law upon his title as executor, and has no need for an injunction. Smith v. Pitchford, 189 Ga. 307, 5 S.E.2d 766 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate court retains jurisdiction of estate when construction of a will becomes incidental to probate proceedings.</b> - Though it is the rule that a direct proceeding to construe a will must be brought in a superior court, where the construction of a will is incidentally involved in a proceeding over which the probate court has jurisdiction, the probate court has jurisdiction under such conditions to interpret the will so far as may be necessary in the proceedings before it. Kaiser v. Kaiser, 178 Ga. 355, 173 S.E. 688 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Removal to a federal court of an action for directions in the distribution of estates, is not permitted.</b> Shehane v. Smith, 257 F. 823 (N.D. Ga. 1919).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cash surrender value of policy not subject to garnishment.</b> - The cash surrender and cash loan value of a policy of life insurance accruing at the end of a specified tontine period is not subject to garnishment by creditors of the insured; nor will such value be made available to the judgment creditor of the insured by a superior court in proceedings instituted for the purpose of obtaining equitable relief analogous to a process of garnishment at law. F &amp; M Bank v. National Life Ins. Co., 161 Ga. 793, 131 S.E. 902, 44 L.R.A. 1184 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining ownership of bank deposit not same as construction of a will.</b> - Where a suit was brought by an executor against the wife of the deceased, for the purpose of determining the ownership of money on deposit in a bank, the construction of the will was not involved, and the allegations and prayers of the petition would not meet the provisions of <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-93, for marshaling assets or for any other equitable relief.

<p class="p4">In order for the court to issue an order to bar the filing of interventions in equity cases after the date fixed in such order, it is essential that the court have in its control assets to administer, marshal, or otherwise dispose of.

<p class="p4"><b>And, case must be pending before superior court.</b> - While this section refers to "all equity cases" now or hereafter pending, it joins thereto the qualifying provision, "wherein assets of either or both parties to the cause are being administered, marshaled, or otherwise disposed of by the court," thus plainly and conclusively showing that, before this section can be resorted to, the case must be pending in a superior court, and assets must then be in the custody of the court for the purpose of being administered, marshaled, or otherwise disposed of.

<p class="p4"><b>Filing of required intervention not obviated by necessity and dignity of taxes.</b> - Neither the fact that all parties and intervenors might be chargeable, as a matter of law with notice that taxes have not been paid, nor that taxes are, under the law, of the highest dignity, obviates the necessity of the filing of an intervention as required by the statute. Suttles v. J.B. Withers Cigar Co., 194 Ga. 617, 22 S.E.2d 129 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Wrongful foreclosure action recognized.</b> - Trial court erred by directing verdict in favor of plaintiff on defendants' wrongful foreclosure claim, as Georgia recognized such a claim and even allowed for damages for mental anguish, despite no evidence indicating that wrongful foreclosure interfered with any attempted sale of the property.

<p class="p4"><b>Wrongful foreclosure claim sufficiently pled.</b> - Trial court erred by dismissing the mortgagors' complaint for wrongful foreclosure because, construed in the light most favorable to the mortgagors, the complaint sufficiently alleged that the bank owed obligations to the mortgagors under the security deed and that the bank breached those contractual obligations by going forward with the foreclosure sale despite the error in the published foreclosure advertisements. Racette v. Bank of Am., N.A., 318 Ga. App. 171, 733 S.E.2d 457 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Putative successor in interest was not entitled to summary judgment on the debtor's wrongful foreclosure claim because the debtor pointed to evidence from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that the successor's conduct at the foreclosure sale, which included abruptly deciding to sell the personal property separately and offering a bid of $25,000 for property the successor believed was worth substantially more, chilled the bidding.

<p class="p4">There was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant's wrongful exercise of the power of sale was a breach of the duty of good faith owed to the debtor and there was also a genuine issue as to whether the debtor had suffered damages as a result of the foreclosure sale. McDaniel v. SunTrust Bank (In re McDaniel), 523 Bankr. 895 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Debtor's claims against creditor bank for wrongful foreclosure and equitable rescission sufficiently stated claims for relief because the allegation that a representative of the bank caused the debtor to believe that a foreclosure sale was cancelled such that the debtor was misled into deferring the exercise of the debtor's legal rights to prevent the foreclosure (by filing a Chapter 13 case) was sufficient to state claims for wrongful foreclosure and rescission of the foreclosure.

<p class="p4"><b>Wrongful foreclosure claim defeated.</b> - Plaintiff's claim for wrongful exercise of a power of sale under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-114 was defeated by the plaintiff's default on the plaintiff's loan obligations and failure to cure the default before foreclosure.

<p class="p4">HUD regulations clearly referenced in a deed as conditions precedent to the power to accelerate and the power of sale could form the basis of a breach of contract action; the homeowner asserted a duty that the bank owed the homeowner, and the homeowner's claim was not barred by the preexisting duty rule.

<p class="p4"><b>Allegation of failure to provide notice supports wrongful foreclosure claim.</b> - Trial court erred in finding that a mortgagor's claim that the mortgagee breached the mortgagee's duty in failing to provide proper notice of the foreclosure sale showed no basis for a wrongful foreclosure claim because an allegation that the lender failed to provide notice of foreclosure as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-162.2 supported a wrongful foreclosure claim under Georgia law and the trial court erroneously considered the mortgagee's evidence outside of the pleadings.

<p class="p4">When by undisputed facts it appears that the sale took place on a date other than as advertised, the court did not err in granting the judgment declaring the order of confirmation null and void, and this is so whether his judgment is considered a judgment on the pleadings, summary judgment, or judgment vacating and setting aside for a nonamendable defect appearing on the face of the record. Hood Oil Co. v. Moss, 134 Ga. App. 477, 214 S.E.2d 726 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While powers of sale in deeds to secure debt shall be strictly construed and exercised, where the evidence is conflicting in a suit attacking the manner in which a power of sale was being exercised, it is insufficient to show an abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying an interlocutory injunction seeking to restrain the exercise of the power. Jones v. Camp, 208 Ga. 164, 65 S.E.2d 596 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Powers of sale contained in deeds to secure a debt and instruments of similar nature are strictly construed and must be fairly exercised. In construing such instruments the words employed to express the intention of the parties will be given their ordinary signification, and where the language of the document is plain, its meaning will not be extended by interpretation.

<p class="p4">A power in a security deed authorizing a sale of the property conveyed, by "party of the second part (the grantee), its agents, or legal representatives, or the sheriff of the county in which the land is situate," does not authorize a sale of the property under the power by a transferee of the grantee, under the rule of strict construction applicable to such powers.

<p class="p4"><b>Formal assignment of deed effectively transfers power of sale contained in deed.</b> - Where a security deed, and the power of sale therein contained, were assigned by the original grantee to a new grantee with the same formality of execution as the deed itself, the power of sale therein contained was one which might properly be exercised by second grantee in the foreclosure proceedings. Williams v. Joel, 89 Ga. App. 329, 79 S.E.2d 401 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where power of sale in the security deed executed prior to the act providing that a power of sale may be exercised by the assignee of the instrument was limited to the grantee, the transferee was without power to exercise the power of sale, and consequently, transferee's deed to another in pursuance of the invalid sale did not convey any title. Etheridge v. Boroughs, 209 Ga. 634, 74 S.E.2d 873 (1953). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debtor has no standing to challenge assignment.</b> - Lower court correctly determined that the debtors lacked standing to challenge the assignment of the security deed to a bank because the security deed afforded the debtors no right to dispute the assignment as the debtors were not third-party beneficiaries of the assignment as a whole and were not intended to directly benefit from the transfer of the power of sale.

<p class="p4"><b>Assignment of security deed did not prohibit foreclosure sale.</b> - Lender's assignment of a security deed through a custodial agreement that did not prohibit the "Custodian/Trustee" bank from exercising a power of sale authorized the bank to conduct the foreclosure sale.

<p class="p4">District court properly dismissed the plaintiff's suit against multiple financial institutions and fictitious parties seeking declaratory and equitable relief to stop foreclosure proceedings as there was no dispute that the holder of the security deed at the time of the proposed foreclosure had the authority to foreclose on the property in accordance with the security deed's power of sale. Assignment of the security deed did not diminish the instrument's powers under Georgia law. Stabb v.

<p class="p4"><b>Standing to foreclose.</b> - Nominee of a lender had standing to foreclose on the plaintiff's property since a note and the security deed clearly provided that the note could be sold and that the nominee would remain the assignee of any subsequent note holder. The plain language of the security deed unequivocally granted to the nominee the right to foreclose and sell the property in the event of the plaintiff's default. Howard v. Mortg. Elec.

<p class="p4"><b>Proof of mailing sufficient.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the mortgagee in a wrongful foreclosure action because the mortgagee submitted evidence that the mortgagee's attorney mailed written notice of the initiation of foreclosure proceedings on the mortgagor by certified mail and by regular mail to the property address and to the mortgagor's post office box and, although there is no evidence that the mortgagor received any of the notices, the evidence of the proof of mailing was sufficient.

<p class="p4"><b>A power of sale in a security deed must be fairly exercised;</b> and where from the language of an advertisement, without more, it appeared that the security deed was void for the want of a legal grantor, the sale might have been chilled by this circumstance and it should have been enjoined until better advertised. Cocke v. Bank of Dawson, 180 Ga. 714, 180 S.E. 711 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a security deed stipulates that the land may be sold after "first advertising the same once a week for four successive weeks," the notice may provide a time for the sale other than the day provided for public sale. Bush v. Growers' Fin. Corp., 176 Ga. 99, 167 S.E. 105 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the owner seeking redemption of property sold under a power of sale pleaded an agreement for redemption after sale, made with the trustee in the security deed merely for the purpose of showing that the power of sale was not fairly exercised, and of having the sale annulled, and did not seek specific performance, the petition was not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) because of the agreement's indefiniteness. Holbrook v. Dickson, 195 Ga. 821, 25 S.E.2d 671 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Finding that the lender's conduct constituted an unfair exercise of the power of sale could be based on evidence that the lender: kept information as to the balance due on the debt from the person responsible therefor, knowing that that person would pay the debt; failed to give proper notice of the time and place of the sale; took personal property from the house after the sale; and bought the property for less than one-fifth of the amount he sold it for shortly after the sale.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A provision in a security deed for accelerating the maturity of the debt should not be so construed as to work hardship on the borrower,</b> where there has been a bona fide effort on his part to comply with his covenant, and the circumstances are such that his efforts at compliance were apparently acceptable to the lender; in such a case, when there has been no waiver of the covenant by the lender, good faith requires that he should, before undertaking to enforce the provisions of the deed accelerating the maturity of the debt for noncompliance with the terms of the covenant, afford to the borrower a reasonable opportunity to fully meet his obligations thereunder.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages for wrongful foreclosure.</b> - Measure of damages for wrongful foreclosure was the fair market value of the property foreclosed rather than the full bid price at a foreclosure sale to an agent of the grantee, in light of the grantee's subsequent sale of the property to a good faith purchaser which prevented the grantors from redeeming their equity. Tower Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Smith, 204 Ga. App. 910, 423 S.E.2d 257, cert. denied, 204 Ga. App. 922, 423 S.E.2d 257 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tort action for wrongful foreclosure.</b> - Where mortgagor did not seek to have foreclosure set aside, but chose to pursue an action in tort "for damages for wrongful foreclosure", mortgagor was not entitled to recover both the property itself and the value of her equity.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred in dismissing a pro se borrower's complaint for wrongful foreclosure and breach of contract against the borrower's lender's alleged assignee; the trial court could not consider documents attached to the motion to dismiss, and the complaint adequately alleged failure to give the borrower notice and improper advertising, contrary to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 44-14-162.2 and 44-14-162(a).

<p class="p4">A power to a mortgagee to sell property mortgaged on failure of the mortgagor to pay the debt at its maturity is a lawful power and is irrevocable, and this power may be exercised against the mortgagor and those claiming under him either by deed or as purchasers at a judicial sale under process to which the mortgage is superior in its lien. Plainville Brick Co. v. Williams, 170 Ga. 75, 152 S.E. 85 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though power of sale in mortgage is conferred upon the grantee for the purpose of facilitating his collection of the amount of the underlying debt which is secured by the property, the power must be exercised fairly; breach of this duty to conduct the sale "fairly" gives rise to a claim for damages to the injured holder of the equity of redemption.

<p class="p4"><b>Foreclosure notice</b> as published was not confusing because it narrowly defined what would be excluded from the sale as funds, and the notice clearly stated what would be sold as realty included anything defined as realty under Georgia law; thus, the notice's publication could not be the basis for the wrongful foreclosure claim.

<p class="p4"><b>The foreclosing party has a duty to obtain that amount which results from a sale conducted according to the terms of the deed and in good faith.</b> - In determining whether this duty under a power of sale has been breached the focus is on the manner in which the sale was conducted and not solely on the result of the sale.

<p class="p4"><b>Therefore allegations of inadequate price insufficient as basis for damages.</b> - If foreclosure sale is conducted according to the terms of the deed and in good faith, alleged failure to obtain an "adequate" price is not a sufficient basis upon which the debtor can base a claim for damages resulting from the exercise of that power.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inadequacy of relief at law essential to equitable relief.</b> - To obtain equitable relief, plaintiff must allege some element or feature of the contract or in the conduct of the defendant to show that the relief at law would not be adequate; he may show that in case the contract is not specifically performed, his damages will be irreparable, or he may show that the measure of damages resulting from the nonperformance of the contract is uncertain or difficult of ascertainment; he may show that the thing contracted for has some intrinsic or special value, such as is possessed by an heirloom, having a special and peculiar value to its owner over and above any market value that can be placed upon it in accordance with strict legal rules; or he may show that the property, though personal, is not of common class, but is unique of its kind, and cannot be readily reproduced, so that others of a similar nature and equal value cannot be procured by damages assessed by means of legal rules, as is the case with paintings or other works of art.

<p class="p4">Where the landlord covenants to maintain the roof in good repair but fails to do so, the remedy of the tenant is to make the repairs himself and look to the landlord for reimbursement, or to occupy the premises without repair and hold the landlord responsible for damages by action or by recoupment to an action for the rent, which remedies are adequate at law.

<p class="p4">Monetary damages were not an adequate remedy at law for a county in the county's suit against a contractor seeking specific performance of an agreement to donate to the county a completed wastewater treatment facility for which the county had paid.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Settlement agreement.</b> - An order of specific performance as to a merely private debt in the form of an unincorporated settlement agreement in a divorce proceeding cannot be deemed to be a more adequate remedy than an action at law for breach of contract damages, since that order cannot constitutionally be enforced by contempt and would not obviate the necessity of the obligee's resort to successive lawsuits for the obligor's future breaches. Eickhoff v. Eickhoff, 263 Ga. 498, 435 S.E.2d 914 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance of real estate contract.</b> - Property owners were entitled to specific performance under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-130 of a settlement agreement by which a seller agreed to re-purchase their property for $1 million. The agreement was not procured by duress because the seller was owned by a sophisticated business person who consulted legal counsel. Hampton Island, LLC v. HAOP, LLC, 306 Ga. App. 542, 702 S.E.2d 770 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a case involving the breach of a real estate sales contract, the sellers were not entitled to specific performance of the contract as the sellers had an adequate remedy at law because the sellers could have accepted the buyers' tender of the $40,000 in earnest money or the buyers' offer to pay the sellers twice the amount of the earnest money to release the buyers from the contract; there was nothing "unique" about the buyers that would support an order requiring the buyers to purchase the property; and specific performance was not a "lawful remedy" for the sellers to choose as the sellers could have obtained an award of monetary damages that adequately compensated the sellers for the buyers' breach.

<p class="p4"><b>New provision regarding reasonableness not applicable.</b> - Based on the date of a defaulted note, which was not superseded or cancelled by the parties' loan modification agreement, the former version of the statute that provided for the lender's attorney's fees controlled, such that a reasonableness determination under the newer version of the statute was not appropriate.

<p class="p4"><b>No right to specific performance existed.</b> - Under the right for any reason rule, the trial court properly denied the plaintiff's claim for specific performance of a Redemption Agreement because the remaining 29 acres had not been sold; thus, no sales proceeds existed to be distributed.

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proof of Contract</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A plaintiff seeking to enforce a contract to make a will giving property to him must prove the precise contract beyond a reasonable doubt.</b> Mann v. Moseley, 208 Ga. 420, 67 S.E.2d 128 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirement of certainty.</b> - A court will not decree the specific performance of a contract for the sale of land unless there is a definite and specific statement of the terms of the contract. The requirement of certainty extends not only to the subject matter and purpose of the contract, but also to the parties, consideration, and even the time and place of performance, where these are essential. Williams v. Manchester Bldg. Supply Co., 213 Ga. 99, 97 S.E.2d 129 (1957); Duvall v. Cox, 215 Ga. 163, 109 S.E.2d 593 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A court will not decree specific performance of a contract which is indefinite and uncertain in any material provision, or where the parties are not specified, or where, in case of lands or interest in lands, the description thereof, or key found therein, is insufficient to identify the same. Bacon v. Bacon, 176 Ga. 191, 167 S.E. 107 (1932); Cashin v. Markwalter, 208 Ga. 444, 67 S.E.2d 226 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A description of land as being parts of two named lots in certain district and section of county, that lie north of lessor's present place of business, bounded on the east by highway, on the north by the county line, on the west by lessor's lands, and on the south by the lands of another individual, is too indefinite to support a decree for possession of the lands by the lessee in an equitable action against the lessor. Harris v. Abney, 208 Ga. 518, 67 S.E.2d 724 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Contract for sale of all of the land known as Wilkinson Pond, consisting of 25 acres, more or less, with the exception of three acres, more or less, to be set aside as a home place containing the Wilkinson home, was void for want of necessary description of any particular land, and afforded no sufficient basis for the extraordinary equitable relief of specific performance. Smith v. Wilkinson, 208 Ga. 489, 67 S.E.2d 698 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Release agreement giving plaintiff option of selecting two acres on east side for release was not too indefinite to be specifically enforced. Jarrard v. Lawson, 244 Ga. 419, 260 S.E.2d 329 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Specific performance of a contract will not be decreed unless the contract is definite and specific, based upon a sufficient legal consideration, and the proof of it is strong, clear, and satisfactory; if the contract is one entire contract, and one portion of the contract is indefinite, the entire contract fails. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Falligant, 208 Ga. 479, 67 S.E.2d 473 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A contract upon which specific performance is sought must be certain, definite, and clear, and so precise in its terms that neither party can reasonably misunderstand it. Bullard v. Bullard, 202 Ga. 769, 44 S.E.2d 770 (1947); Wehunt v. Pritchett, 208 Ga. 441, 67 S.E.2d 233 (1951); Harris v. Trippi, 209 Ga. 369, 72 S.E.2d 704 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the terms of an option were so vague, uncertain, and indefinite as to be incapable of enforcement, the petition failed to set forth a cause of action for specific performance. Erwin v. Hardin, 187 Ga. 275, 200 S.E. 159 (1938); Williams v. Manchester Bldg. Supply Co., 213 Ga. 99, 97 S.E.2d 129 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A petition requesting specific performance of a contract for the sale of land which contains no allegation showing the value of the property involved so as to enable this court to determine whether or not the contract is fair, just, and equitable and can, in good conscience, be decreed to be specifically performed, fails to state a cause of action for specific performance. Crown Corp. v. Galanti, 220 Ga. 660, 140 S.E.2d 898 (1965). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a handwritten loan agreement did not sufficiently describe the land to be conveyed in the event of a default, and because the lender had an adequate remedy at law in the form of a monetary judgment, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant specific performance. Kirkley v. Jones, 250 Ga. App. 113, 550 S.E.2d 686 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>To constitute a valid sale of real estate which a court will require to be specifically performed,</b> the following are the essentials to the contract of such sale: (1) the memorandum of contract must specify the parties, that is, the seller and the buyer; (2) the memorandum must sufficiently describe the subject matter of the contract; and (3) the memorandum must name the consideration. The consideration need not be expressly stated if the memorandum of contract furnishes a key by which the amount of the purchase price can be ascertained. If the consideration is not all to be paid in cash, then the times and amounts of deferred payments must be specified. When the contract expressly states the amount of purchase money or furnishes a key by which it can be ascertained, then the contract is sufficient. Beller &amp; Gould v. Lisenby, 246 Ga. 15, 268 S.E.2d 611 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A document that was simply a purchase offer</b> lacked the elements needed to create a binding and enforceable contract, and neither specific performance nor damages were obtainable based on it. Lee v. Green Land Co., 245 Ga. App. 558, 538 S.E.2d 189 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Substantial Compliance</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance may properly be refused if a substantial part of the agreed exchange for the performance to be compelled is as yet unperformed</b> and its concurrent or future performance is not well secured to the satisfaction of the court. F. &amp; C. Inv. Co. v. Jones, 210 Ga. 635, 81 S.E.2d 828 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The person seeking specific performance of a contract to make a will giving property to him must show, in addition to the contract, a substantial compliance with his part of the agreement. Mann v. Moseley, 208 Ga. 420, 67 S.E.2d 128 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tender of purchase price.</b> - While there must be a tender of the purchase price before equity will decree specific performance of a contract for the sale of land, where the petition alleges that the defendants, when notified by the plaintiff that he had purchased from original party his contract with them for the sale of the property, repudiated the contract, notified him that they had no intention of complying with its terms, and that they would refuse to accept the tender of any money under the contract, the tender is waived. Gilleland v. Welch, 199 Ga. 341, 34 S.E.2d 517 (1945); Todd v. Bivins, 215 Ga. 402, 110 S.E.2d 768 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Before equity will decree specific performance of a contract for the sale of land at the instance of the purchaser, there must, in the absence of waiver, be an unconditional tender of the purchase price. Gilleland v. Welch, 199 Ga. 341, 34 S.E.2d 517 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a petitioner sought specific performance of a conditional contract for the purchase of a described house and lot, but the petition failed to allege that the express condition had been met, no right to the relief sought was set forth. Wehunt v. Pritchett, 208 Ga. 441, 67 S.E.2d 233 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a contract for the purchase of land provided that the purchaser, upon obtaining a deed from the seller, would execute a deed to secure an unpaid balance of the purchase price, and the seller's deed was delivered, but the purchaser refused to execute the security deed, equity would have jurisdiction of a suit by the seller for specific performance, to enforce the terms of the purchaser's agreement. Waters v. Tillman, 194 Ga. 552, 22 S.E.2d 173 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance and damages are not inconsistent remedies, and may be pursued in the same action.</b> Loewus v. Eskridge &amp; Downing, Inc., 175 Ga. 456, 165 S.E. 576 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance is not a remedy which either party may claim as a matter of absolute right,</b> and mere inadequacy of price, or any other fact showing the contract to be unfair, unjust, or against good conscience, may justify the refusal of this remedy. Whitehead v. Dillard, 178 Ga. 714, 174 S.E. 244 (1934); Wehunt v. Pritchett, 208 Ga. 441, 67 S.E.2d 233 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a contract for the sale of land is in writing, is certain and fair in all its parts, is for an adequate consideration, and capable of being performed, it is just as much a matter of course for a court to decree a specific performance of it as it is for a court to give damages for it in other cases. Jones v. Smith, 206 Ga. 162, 56 S.E.2d 462 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegations necessary to defeat motion requesting dismissal of petition.</b> - A petition for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land, is sufficient as against general demurrer (now motion to dismiss), where it is alleged that the contract is in writing, signed by both of the parties, is certain and fair, and is for an adequate consideration and capable of being performed. Scheer v. Doss, 211 Ga. 7, 83 S.E.2d 612 (1954); Todd v. Bivins, 215 Ga. 402, 110 S.E.2d 768 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Newton v. Lawson, 313 Ga. App. 29, 720 S.E.2d 353 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Partial payment and possession.</b> - While payment of a part of the purchase-money is not alone such part performance as will take the case out of the statute of frauds, partial payment of the purchase-money accompanied with possession will amount to such part performance as to take the contract out of the statute and to authorize the specific performance of a parol contract. Smith v. Cox, 247 Ga. 563, 277 S.E.2d 512 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment in full on oral contract for sale of land.</b> - In a suit for specific performance brought by a plaintiff seeking to enforce an alleged oral contract to sell real property, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant based on the Statute of Frauds preventing recovery to the plaintiff; the plaintiff had presented evidence establishing the existence of an oral contract for the sale of the property and that it was excepted from the Statute of Frauds based on the plaintiff's performance of paying for the property in full, and thus, issues of fact remained as to whether defendant's decedent had accepted performance through payments received by a sibling and whether, in light of the plaintiff's previous tenancy, the plaintiff's performance was inconsistent with the lack of a contract to sell the property. Edwards v. Sewell, 289 Ga. App. 128, 656 S.E.2d 246 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession with valuable improvements.</b> - When a party seeking specific performance of an oral contract to sell realty relies on the principle of possession with improvements, it must be shown that the possession and improvement arose by virtue of and in the faith of the oral contract or promise, so as to take the case out of the statute of frauds and constitute the equivalent of a writing by showing acts unequivocally referring to the alleged contract or promise; thus, where a party takes possession under an oral contract to rent, and also alleged an oral option to purchase, the possession is under the tenancy and cannot also be shown to be in reliance on the option.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creation of parol license to use land did not interfere with existing right of first refusal.</b> - In a suit brought by a property owner seeking to specifically perform an oral agreement to purchase a strip of real estate, the trial court properly denied the property owner's request for an interlocutory judgment based on a violation of the statute of frauds and because another held a first right of refusal over the sale/purchase of the property. However, the trial court erred by concluding that the property owner had not obtained a parol license to use the strip since the property owner had made expenditures to improve the land and, as to the right of first refusal held by another, the grant of a parol license was not the equivalent to a sale of the property to have in anyway interfered with that right. Meinhardt v. Christianson, 289 Ga. App. 238, 656 S.E.2d 568 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of complaint.</b> - Plaintiff's complaint alleging that she entered into a parol agreement with her husband to dissolve the marriage, divide the marital estate, and arrange for child support, that she possessed the property and paid the mortgage pursuant to the agreement, and that she maintained and improved the property, stated a claim under this section. Coleman v. Coleman, 265 Ga. 568, 459 S.E.2d 166 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance warranted.</b> - Plaintiff's possession and partial payment, as well as plaintiff's possession with valuable improvements, and the payment of tax and mortgage arrears satisfied the requirements for an order of specific performance of an oral contract for the sale of land. Dobbs v. Dobbs, 270 Ga. 887, 515 S.E.2d 384 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under an oral agreement, the only performance which plaintiff had yet to complete was his payment of the remaining portion of the agreed purchase price and that payment was not due until closing; therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on plaintiff's claim for specific performance. Braddy v. Boynton, 271 Ga. 55, 515 S.E.2d 394 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a contractor's performance and an owner's acceptance of that performance satisfied the requirements of the statute of frauds, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-5-31, and the plats and deeds established the requisite description of the properties to be exchanged, the contractor was entitled to specific performance under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-131(a). Masters v. Redwine, 279 Ga. 432, 615 S.E.2d 118 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Superior court did not err in granting a purchaser summary judgment in the purchaser's action seeking specific performance pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-131 and requiring a mortgage company to deliver a deed conveying certain property because the company failed to demonstrate any merit in the company's contention that the superior court improperly refused to invoke the court's equitable power to relieve the company from performing under the foreclosure sale contract on the ground that the opening bid the company set forth was a mistake. Because the dollar amount of the high bid at the foreclosure sale alone made it immediately apparent that there had been a mistake, a reasonable inference arose that had reasonable diligence been employed before the foreclosure sale, the alleged unilateral mistake would not have occurred. Decision One Mortg. Co., LLC v. Victor Warren Props., Inc., 304 Ga. App. 423, 696 S.E.2d 145 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance not warranted.</b> - Specific performance of a low-cost lease of property was not merited because plaintiff had been paid back for the investment in commencing a landfill on the property and did not argue that an award of money damages was not sufficient. Elliott v. McDaniel, 224 Ga. App. 848, 483 S.E.2d 104 (1997), rev'd on other grounds, 269 Ga. 262, 497 S.E.2d 786 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the defendant simply made a bid for the property at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, which was accepted by the seller, no partial performance of the contract occurred and the transaction, therefore, stayed within the confines of the statute of frauds. James v. Safari Enters., Inc., 244 Ga. App. 813, 537 S.E.2d 103 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The trial court did not err in directing a verdict against a counterclaim to enforce an oral agreement between the parties to reconvey property to the defendant, notwithstanding proof of part performance by the defendant consisting of the defendant's continued possession after conveying the property plus making monthly payments to the plaintiff of approximately $450, since, although this was consistent with the existence of an oral agreement to convey the property back to the defendant after a loan was paid off, it was also consistent with the lack of such an agreement, since monthly payments approximating rent did not establish part performance of the alleged oral agreement to reconvey the property to the defendant. Rose v. Cain, 247 Ga. App. 481, 544 S.E.2d 453 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a party who leased certain land from its supposed owner, who could not read, attempted to enforce an option to purchase the land, which was included in documents the lessee gave the owner to sign, the lessee's partial payment, possession of, and improvements to the land did not entitle the lessee to enforce the contract under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-131(a) because the lessee was not trying to enforce an oral contract, to which the statute referred, and the lessee's possession and payment arose by virtue of the lease provision of the parties' agreement, rather than any option to purchase. Makowski v. Waldrop, 262 Ga. App. 130, 584 S.E.2d 714 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A trial court erred in finding that a lease-purchase agreement was enforceable because, though it satisfied the statute of frauds, it was invalid for failure of consideration in that the lessee/proposed purchaser never paid the rent owed nor any of the property taxes, which not only invalidated the agreement but voided the purchase option under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-8(a). Further, the trial court erred in holding that the lessee/proposed purchaser was entitled to specific performance of the agreement based on repairs made since there was no legal authority to support the trial court's proposition that part performance of an otherwise unenforceable written agreement, as modified by subsequent oral agreements between the parties, transformed it into an enforceable parol contract. Estate of Ryan v. Shuman, 288 Ga. App. 868, 655 S.E.2d 644 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0664, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 482 (Ga. 2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Possession, etc., must be based on oral contract or promise.</b> - Where possession and valuable improvements are relied upon for specific performance they must have been by virtue of and on the faith of the oral contract or promise so as to take the case out of the statute of frauds and constitute the equivalent of a writing by showing acts unequivocally referring to the alleged contract or promise.

<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof generally.</b> - Evidence which shows all of the requirements necessary to establish a complete equity to land under a parol gift can be offered as a defense to a dispossessory proceeding. The establishment of a complete equity shifts to the plaintiffs the burden of showing some superior right or title to defeat or overcome the defendant's right. Ogden v.

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance of contract may be refused where consideration is inadequate,</b> though the court will not rescind it under this section. Hunt v. Jackson Formby's Guardian, 43 Ga. 79 (1871).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court should not deny decree for specific performance merely upon ground of inadequacy of consideration,</b> unless there is such a gross disparity of consideration as to shock the moral conscience and to amount in itself to evidence of fraud, the adequacy of consideration being generally a matter to be determined by the parties for themselves. Whitehead v. Dillard, 178 Ga. 714, 174 S.E. 244 (1934); McLoon v. McLoon, 220 Ga. 18, 136 S.E.2d 740 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>But specific performance may be denied where gross inadequacy shown.</b> - Where the inadequacy of price is so great as to give to the contract the character of unreasonableness and hardship, the court and jury will stay the exercise of their discretionary power in enforcing a specific performance. Hotaling v. Anderson, 226 Ga. 327, 175 S.E.2d 5 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Shareholders failed to rebut corporations showing price offered for shares was fair.</b> - Corporation was properly granted specific performance of a shareholder agreement requiring the corporation's former employees to sell back their shares at the price the corporation offered as the corporation submitted an affidavit calculating the corporation's "going concern" value - the formula for determining share value set out in the shareholder agreement - and the employees offered no evidence countering the affidavit. Furthermore, since there were no allegations that there was anything unfair, unjust, or violative of the conscience about the agreement, the shareholders' equitable defenses were inapplicable to the corporation's claim for specific performance of the agreement. Clawson v. Intercat, Inc., 294 Ga. App. 624, 669 S.E.2d 671 (2008), cert. denied, No. S09C0462, 2009 Ga. LEXIS 199 (Ga. 2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Determination of Fairness</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Case by case method of determination of fairness, etc.</b> - A provision in a contract for deferred payments, without a provision for security to the seller, does not necessarily make a contract inequitable, unjust, and unenforceable under this section. The particular circumstances of the case would determine whether such a contract is fair and just to both parties. Chewning v. Brand, 230 Ga. 255, 196 S.E.2d 399 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equity will never decree specific performance of fraudulent, illegal, or hard and unconscionable bargain.</b> Swint v. Carr, 76 Ga. 322, 2 Am. St. R. 44 (1886).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract upon which specific performance is sought must be certain, definite, and clear.</b> and so precise in its terms that neither party can reasonably misunderstand it. Estes v. Winn, 136 Ga. 344, 71 S.E. 470 (1911); Miller v. Watson, 139 Ga. 29, 76 S.E. 585 (1912); Treadwell v. Treadwell, 216 Ga. 156, 115 S.E.2d 535 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the alleged contract sued on is based on an oral agreement to convey or devise land in consideration of the performance of ordinary personal services, the petition must not only show that the contract is precise in its terms, but must also allege the value of such service and the value of the land or specific data from which such relative values can be determined. Treadwell v. Treadwell, 216 Ga. 156, 115 S.E.2d 535 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Petition which did not give with precision the terms of contract for sale of land or its date, and which did not allege the extent and value of the services rendered or the value of the lands involved, which values must be set forth in order to show that the contract which it sought to enforce is one not unfair, unjust, or against good conscience, did not state a cause of action for specific performance. Johns v. Nix, 196 Ga. 417, 26 S.E.2d 526 (1943); Jenkins v. Evans, 202 Ga. 423, 43 S.E.2d 501 (1947); Howington v. Juhan, 218 Ga. 748, 130 S.E.2d 822 (1963); Walker v.

<p class="p4">In order for a suit for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land to prevail, the plaintiff must prove the value of the property so as to enable the court to determine that the contract was fair, just, and not against good conscience. Morgan v. Mitchell, 209 Ga. 348, 72 S.E.2d 310 (1952); Jones v. Dallas, 243 Ga. 124, 252 S.E.2d 603 (1979). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where there was a lack of necessary and indispensable allegations as to adequacy of consideration, the petition failed to state a cause of action for specific performance of an option to sell property, the only relief sought; and the court should have sustained the defendants' general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) raising that question and dismissed the petition. Alexander v. American Legion Post No. 28, 209 Ga. 285, 71 S.E.2d 627 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a petition for specific performance of an alleged lease of lands, to be used by the lessee for an airfield does not allege any sum of money to be the fair, just, and equitable rental value of the lands, and the alleged lease provides that the lessor shall be paid 10 percent of the passenger traffic, and 5 percent for instructions, there is nothing upon which to base a decision that the contract is fair, just, and equitable, and in good conscience should be performed. Harris v. Abney, 208 Ga. 518, 67 S.E.2d 724 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment inappropriate when fairness and value issues remain.</b> - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the option holder on the holder's specific performance claim against the option grantors; issues of fairness and value remained regarding the option contract, thus precluding summary judgment. Henry v. Blankenship, 275 Ga. App. 658, 621 S.E.2d 601 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Vendor has no right to force upon vendee something which he has not agreed to buy.</b> The rule is different, however, when the application for specific performance comes from the vendee. There is a manifest reason for this difference. The vendee has a right, if he sees proper to do so, to accept less than he bargained for, and compensation for the loss of that which he does not obtain. R.C. Cropper Co. v. Middle Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Specific performance and damages may be pursued in same action.</b> - If, on the trial of an action for specific performance, it should be developed that without fault of the plaintiff but on account of the defendant himself a specific performance of the contract is impossible, the court may proceed to assess damages for a breach of the contract. An amendment praying for such damages would not in contemplation of law make a new cause of action, for this section expressly authorizes the granting of such relief, even when not contemplated by the original suit. Armor v. Stubbs, 150 Ga. 520, 104 S.E. 500 (1920); Lewis v. Warren, 51 Ga. App. 135, 179 S.E. 918 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Adequate remedy at law not ground for dismissal of petition with legal cause of action when filed in superior court.</b> - A petition which sets forth a legal cause of action, though using terms appropriate to an equitable proceeding, insofar as the same does not seek any extraordinary relief, is not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the ground that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy by bringing an action at law. Arteaga v. Arteaga, 169 Ga. 595, 151 S.E. 5 (1929); Woodall v. Williams, 176 Ga. 343, 167 S.E. 886 (1933); Latham v. Fowler, 192 Ga. 686, 16 S.E.2d 591 (1941); Pardue Medicine Co. v. Pardue, 194 Ga. 516, 22 S.E.2d 143 (1942); Cohen v. Cohen, 200 Ga. 33, 35 S.E.2d 908 (1945); Parnell v. Wooten, 202 Ga. 443, 43 S.E.2d 673 (1947); Echols v. Thompson, 210 Ga. 37, 77 S.E.2d 521 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This section changed the rule that a petition praying for only ordinary equitable relief is demurrable</b> (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the ground that the plaintiff has a complete and adequate remedy at law. Teasley v. Bradley, 110 Ga. 497, 35 S.E. 782, 78 Am. St. R. 113 (1900); Booth &amp; Co. v. Mohr &amp; Sons, 122 Ga. 333, 50 S.E. 173 (1905); Georgia Peruvian Ochre Co. v.

Barnwell, 184 Ga. 461, 192 S.E. 191 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>So petition not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) on certain grounds.</b> - Since the passage of this section a petition which sets forth a legal cause of action, though using terms appropriate to an equitable proceeding, is not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the grounds: (a) that it sets forth no cause of action; (b) that there is no equity in the petition; and (c) that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law. Smith v. Hancock, 163 Ga. 222, 136 S.E. 52 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Because legal and equitable cases may be joined in the same action.</b> Concrete Coring Contractors v. Mechanical Contractors &amp; Eng'rs, 220 Ga. 714, 141 S.E.2d 439 (1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Also, misjoinder of claims not ground for objection.</b> - The joining against the same defendants of legal and equitable rights and remedies which are connected with or dependent upon each other does not render a petition subject to the objection of duplicity or misjoinder of claims. Center v. Arp, 198 Ga. 574, 32 S.E.2d 308 (1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And despite statutory remedies at law, a superior court could settle the whole controversy</b> to avoid a multiplicity of actions. Haney v. Sheppard, 207 Ga. 158, 60 S.E.2d 453 (1950).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of article.</b> - This and kindred legislation (this article and <span class="s1">§§</span> 23-4-2 and 23-4-3) was intended to afford a party the opportunity to have all his rights in regard to the subject matter tried in one action in the superior court, without the necessity of having two distinct actions to settle his legal rights and his equitable rights against the adverse party. Sometimes equitable pleadings by one of the parties may require the making of additional parties, in order that full relief may be granted. Delaney v. Sheehan, 138 Ga. 510, 75 S.E. 632 (1912); Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Taggart, 38 Ga. App. 509, 144 S.E. 400 (1928); Cummings v. Robinson, 194 Ga. 336, 21 S.E.2d 627 (1942); Moore v. Robinson, 206 Ga. 27, 55 S.E.2d 711 (1949); Earney v. Owen, 213 Ga. 412, 99 S.E.2d 201 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Actions arising out of general plan between parties must be asserted in one action.</b> - Where proceeding to enjoin an action against plaintiff to cancel a sale of plaintiff's property by defendant as well as the note on which the defendant is suing arose out of same general plan between the parties to develop and operate a recreational place, defendant in action on note by answer and counterclaim must assert all his claims for legal and equitable relief arising out of the general plan between the parties, and could not bring an independent action to enjoin action on the note and litigate those matters. Clay v. Smith, 207 Ga. 610, 63 S.E.2d 602 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a trover action was filed in a superior court, and thereafter the defendant filed, in a different superior court, an equitable action, to enjoin the trover action, and for other relief, so far as the petition alleged any defense or cause of complaint against any of the parties named as defendants, the same could have been asserted as effectually by way of defense or counterclaim in the trover proceeding, and the allegations did not show any necessity for an independent equitable action. Hamilton v. First Nat'l Bank, 180 Ga. 820, 180 S.E. 840 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 9-5-6 on proceedings under this article.</b> - Although under this article a creditor may in one action proceed for judgment on his debt and to set aside a fraudulent conveyance made by his debtor, still, under <span class="s1">§</span> 9-5-6, creditors who have not reduced their demands to judgment, and who have no lien otherwise, cannot, as a general rule, enjoin their debtors from selling or disposing of their property.

<p class="p4"><b>All distinction between legal and equitable remedies and relief and the modes of administering them are not abolished.</b> Except in providing that both kinds shall be applied for by one form of petition, and may be administered by the court in one and the same proceeding, it leaves the mode of trial as to each unchanged.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This section does not give to the superior courts an unlimited power</b> to "give effect to all the rights of the parties, legal or equitable, or both," but the exercise of the power is restricted to instances when the nature of the case may allow or require it. Rogers v. Rogers, 183 Ga. 131, 187 S.E. 633 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Collateral matters not within scope of original proceedings not encompassable by equitable jurisdiction.</b> - While a court of equitable jurisdiction, when it has all the necessary parties before it and has once taken jurisdiction of a particular subject matter, will ordinarily proceed to do complete justice, and finally administer the rights of each of the respective parties, it will not extend its jurisdiction in such manner as to draw to itself collateral matters not appropriately comprehended within the scope of the original proceedings under which, in the first instance, it assumed jurisdiction. Rogers v. Rogers, 183 Ga. 131, 187 S.E. 633 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lack of jurisdiction of nonresident party prevents superior court from taking jurisdiction.</b> - A separate and distinct equitable cause of action against the resident defendant will not give the superior court of the county of his residence jurisdiction of a nonresident defendant against whom the plaintiff has another, independent, separate and distinct equitable cause of action; this is especially true where the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law on his cause of action against the nonresident defendant. Shaheen v. Dunaway Drug Stores, Inc., 246 Ga. 790, 273 S.E.2d 158 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Showing prerequisites to maintenance of petition.</b> - Since the passage of the Uniform Procedure Act of 1887 (now this article, <span class="s1">§§</span> 23-4-2 and 23-4-3), it is not necessary, in order to maintain the petition, that the plaintiff should make it appear that it has no remedy at law. DeLacy v. Hurst, Purnell &amp; Co., 83 Ga. 223, 9 S.E. 1052 (1889); Georgia Iron &amp; Coal Co. v. Etowah Iron Co., 104 Ga. 395, 30 S.E. 878 (1898); Ray v.

<p class="p4"><b>Grounds for extraordinary relief unchanged.</b> - Since this article and <span class="s1">§§</span> 23-4-2 and 23-4-3, permitting parties to obtain all necessary and proper legal and equitable relief in the same case, did not create any new ground for extraordinary remedies, the settled general rule stills obtains that the remedy of injunction does not lie in favor of one who has a complete and adequate remedy at law, such as an ordinary attachment. Virginia-Carolina Chem. Co. v. Provident Sav. Life Assurance Soc'y, 126 Ga. 50, 54 S.E. 929 (1906); Campbell v. Deal, 185 Ga. 474, 195 S.E. 432 (1938); Lawrence v.

<p class="p4"><b>Petition for accounting maintainable even though proof for injunctive relief not shown.</b> - A petition for an injunction and an accounting, alleging that the defendant had excluded the petitioner from the management of his business and had acquired and failed to account for considerable moneys derived from its profits, while failing to allege any fraud or insolvency of the defendant, and thus not showing any ground for injunctive relief, sufficiently stated a cause of action for an accounting. Cohen v. Cohen, 200 Ga. 33, 35 S.E.2d 908 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Also, where a plaintiff seeks by way of accounting to recover an amount alleged to be due him upon a contract, and to that extent may have prima facie an adequate remedy at law, and it also appears from the allegations of the petition that his action for damages is not an adequate remedy, or that his legal remedy will be nugatory without the cooperation of equity, the aid of a court of equity may be invoked. Alexis, Inc. v. Werbell, 209 Ga. 665, 75 S.E.2d 168 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And, while the general rule is that, for a plaintiff to maintain an equitable petition to remove a cloud upon his title,</b> he must allege and prove possession in himself, nevertheless since it is competent for the plaintiff to obtain both legal and equitable relief in the same action where a plaintiff seeks to have the title to land declared to be in herself, in addition to cancellation and injunction, the fact that the plaintiff fails to show possession in herself does not prevent her from having the title to the property adjudged to be in her, although such fact would defeat the cancellation sought.

<p class="p4"><b>Reformation of deed, recovery of possession, and damages maintainable in one action.</b> - The owner of land who has to have reformation of one or more deeds in his title chain before he can recover, by ejectment or other legal remedy, the possession of land held adversely to him may bring an action in superior court to reform the deed and in the same action pray for recovery of the possession of the land and for damages for its detention.

<p class="p4"><b>Different judgments against different parties.</b> - Where an equitable defense is set up by the defendant in an action of ejectment and prevails against the right of any one or more of the plaintiffs to recover, the common-law rule as to actions of ejectment, that all the plaintiffs shall recover or none, does not apply. Rumph v. Truelove, 66 Ga. 480 (1881); Milner v. Vandivere, 86 Ga. 540, 12 S.E. 879 (1891).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>A plaintiff in an action to quiet title must assert that he holds some current record title or current prescriptive title,</b> and not only an expectancy, in order to maintain his suit. Gilmore v. Hunt, 137 Ga. 272, 73 S.E. 364 (1910); In re Rivermist Homeowners Ass'n, 244 Ga. 515, 260 S.E.2d 897 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>The petition must contain a request for cancellation of an instrument,</b> otherwise it is defective and, thus, subject to motion to dismiss. Tucker v. Ezell, 148 Ga. 47, 95 S.E. 672 (1918).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And the petition should contain not mere conclusions but statements of fact</b> showing that claimant is the true owner. Weyman v. City of Atlanta, 122 Ga. 539, 50 S.E. 492 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No right to jury trial.</b> - Special master did not err by denying a property owner a right to a jury trial in a buyer's quiet title action as the action was brought under the conventional quia timet statute and the owner had no right to a jury trial. Davis v. Harpagon Co., LLC, 281 Ga. 250, 637 S.E.2d 1 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Delinquent taxpayer had no right to a jury trial in a transferee's action to remove any clouds as to the title on the delinquent taxpayer's property, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-40, to which the transferee obtained title to by the order of a special master. Human v. Harpagon Co., LLC, 281 Ga. 372, 637 S.E.2d 684 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When one seeks conventional quia timet, one is not entitled to trial by jury under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-43; when one seeks quia timet against all the world, however, one is entitled by the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66 to a jury trial, but there is no right to a jury trial when a suit at law is converted by amendment into an equitable proceeding. Vatacs Group, Inc. v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 292 Ga. 483, 738 S.E.2d 83 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly appointed a special master in a quiet title action and a corporation, who was unsuccessful in the corporation's claim for the property, was properly held not entitled to a jury trial because the suing bank had amended the bank's petition to provide for an action only for conventional quia timet by the time the petition was heard by the special master; therefore, no jury trial was available under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-43.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Quiet title action from tax sale.</b> - Because a tax sale listed the wrong owner of the property to be sold and the description of the property was inconsistent, such that it was unclear which property was being sold, the bidder's deed was defective, as was the quitclaim deed of the purchaser of the property from the bidder, and accordingly, there was no merit to the purchaser's claim that it was due summary judgment on the issue of whether the owner's executrix had a right to redeem the property or whether it was barred under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 48-4-45; after the tax sale, the bidder quitclaimed the deed to the purchaser, which occurred prior to the sheriff's "administrative cancellation" of the tax sale due to procedural errors, and the purchaser's action to quiet title, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-40 et seq., resulted in summary judgment to the executrix. Harpagon Co. v. Gelfond, 279 Ga. 59, 608 S.E.2d 597 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a quiet title action, the owner of property at the time the property was sold at a tax sale had standing to petition for title because the owner filed the petition and the trial court ruled on the petition during the time when the owner's right to redeem existed, as the title as owner was not divested and the tax sale purchaser had no right to possess property at that time. Republic Title Company, LLC v. Freeport Title and Guaranty, Inc., 351 Ga. App. 408, 829 S.E.2d 172 (2019), cert. denied, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 168 (Ga. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action not one to quiet title.</b> - Action to set aside a deed that conveyed a property interest did not fit within this section's definition, since the plaintiff was not seeking to cancel an instrument that placed a cloud on her title or subjected her to future liability. Wilson v. United States, 781 F. Supp. 779 (M.D. Ga. 1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The principle upon which equity will lend its aid to remove a cloud upon title is</b> that one in the rightful possession of property is entitled to the full, quiet, and peaceful enjoyment of the same, without present annoyance and harassment, or threatened molestation. Duffee v. Jones, 208 Ga. 639, 68 S.E.2d 699 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Allegations in petition, seeking a cancellation of a deed as a cloud upon the plaintiffs' title to an undivided two-sevenths' interest in the land, were not sufficient to constitute a cause of action as a proceeding quia timet under this section, where the petition did not allege that the deed purported to convey a complete title to a full interest in the tract. Clark v. Woody, 197 Ga. 683, 30 S.E.2d 181 (1944). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although it is the general rule that, in order for a plaintiff to maintain an equitable petition to remove a cloud upon his title, he must allege and prove possession in himself, where there is any other distinct head of equity jurisdiction sufficient to support the action, possession of the plaintiff is not required. Sweat v. Arline, 186 Ga. 460, 197 S.E. 893 (1938); Moore v. Moore, 188 Ga. 303, 4 S.E.2d 18 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where plaintiff seeks specific performance of an oral contract for the devise of property of which he is in possession but which is owned by his aunt, and alleges that distress warrants for rent have been taken against him by her, it is shown that his interest in the property is put in jeopardy by the deed. Harp v. Bacon, 222 Ga. 478, 150 S.E.2d 655 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A court of equity has jurisdiction to cancel an execution illegally issued,</b> and this is especially true where there is nothing in the record showing or tending to show that the execution sought to be canceled had been levied on any of the plaintiff's property when the litigation was instituted. Lenett v. Lutz, 215 Ga. 369, 110 S.E.2d 628 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery of rents and profits.</b> - In a suit to recover and cancel the deeds of the defendant as clouds on the plaintiff's title, the plaintiff, if entitled to recover the land, may also recover the rents and profits while possession of the land was wrongfully withheld by the defendant. Marshall v. Pierce, 136 Ga. 543, 71 S.E. 893 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment proper once security deed paid in full.</b> - In an action to remove a cloud from title, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to a bank and cancelled a recorded deed in favor of a holder, as: (1) the holder could no longer claim any legal title to the subject property once the underlying debt thereto was paid; (2) no evidence of valid renewal or extension of the note existed; and (3) the holder lacked standing to challenge any foreclosure on the debt. Northwest Carpets, Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank, 280 Ga. 535, 630 S.E.2d 407 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employed against deed or writing.</b> - Special master erred in concluding that the property purchaser's action to quiet title was a conventional quia timet employed to quiet title, as that action was used to quiet title as to a deed or other writing which casts a cloud over a title, whereas the property purchaser's action was a quia timet action against all the world; however, no error occurred in denying the property claimant's motion for a jury trial even though an action against the entire world allowed for one, as the evidence did not present a question of fact that required a jury. Gurley v. E. Atlanta Land Co., 276 Ga. 749, 583 S.E.2d 866 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisites not met.</b> - Plaintiff's claim failed because plaintiff had not alleged that plaintiff paid off the mortgage loan in full to satisfy the Security Deed or that plaintiff's signature on the Security Deed was false. Bowman v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga. Aug. 1, 2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Decedent's estate administrator's claim for conventional quiet title failed because the decedent did not hold some current record title or current prescriptive title upon execution of a security deed when the amount thereunder had not been fully paid. Shannon v. Albertelli Firm, P.C.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir.

<p class="p4"><b>State immune from suit.</b> - Sovereign immunity barred a conventional quiet title action against the state, which was immune from suit. TDGA, LLC v. CBIRA, LLC, 298 Ga. 510, 783 S.E.2d 107 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Cloud upon title" defined.</b> - In order for an outstanding conveyance to be a cloud upon title, it is necessary that it of itself, or in connection with alleged extrinsic facts, should constitute an apparent title; that is, one upon which a recovery could or might be had against the true owner were he in possession and relying upon possession alone. Anything which would force him to attack the adverse title, or to exhibit his own, would be a cloud; anything which would not have this effect, would be no cloud. An instrument which springs from no definite source whatsoever, for example, from a stranger to the title, can never properly be considered a cloud. Thompson v. Etowah Iron Co., 91 Ga. 538, 17 S.E. 663 (1893); McMullen v. Cooper, 125 Ga. 435, 54 S.E. 97 (1906). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Removal of cloud requires proof of possession.</b> - The general rule is that, in order for a plaintiff to maintain an equitable petition to remove a cloud upon his title, he must allege and prove actual possession in himself, for the reason that where the defendant is in possession, the plaintiff has a remedy to test his title at law by bringing an action in ejectment, which is ordinarily deemed an adequate remedy, and there is no ground for the exercise of equitable jurisdiction. Hale v. Turner, 183 Ga. 593, 189 S.E. 10 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Except where there is any other distinct head of equity jurisdiction sufficient to support the action,</b> possession by the plaintiff is not required, but equity will retain the cause and grant relief by quieting the title or removing clouds.

<p class="p4"><b>Authority of special master and judge.</b> - In submitting a quiet title case to the special master, the trial court did not cede jurisdiction to render a final decision as although the trial court was not required to hear exceptions to the special master's report, the trial court had to independently evaluate the correctness of the report before adopting the report as judgment and it was the trial court, not the special master, who ordered disbursement of excess funds following the tax sale.

<p class="p4"><b>Jury trial unavailable.</b> - While a special master erred in concluding the property purchaser's action to quiet title was a conventional quia timet action, and, thus, no jury trial was available to the property claimant, the claimant was not harmed by the error; although a jury trial was available regarding the property purchaser's action in quia timet as against all the world, the property claimant did not show that the evidence presented a question of fact, and, thus, the intervention of a jury was not required.

<p class="p10"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisites not met.</b> - Plaintiff could not succeed on a claim pursuant to the statute because plaintiff had not alleged many of the statutory prerequisites to this claim, such as including a particular description of the land involved in the proceeding, including a plat survey of the land, including a copy of the instrument upon which plaintiff's interest was based, and providing the name and address of possible adverse claimants. Bowman v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga. Aug. 1, 2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sovereign immunity not applicable to in rem quiet title action.</b> - Sovereign immunity was not applicable to an in rem quiet title action against all the world under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 as such an action was against the underlying property itself. TDGA, LLC v. CBIRA, LLC, 298 Ga. 510, 783 S.E.2d 107 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney fees and expenses.</b> - Plaintiff who brought an action to quiet title and for partitioning of property was not entitled to an award of attorney fees and expenses since the statutes providing for such actions do not provide for attorney fees and expenses and such an award was not authorized if the case was considered one at law. Walker v. Walker, 266 Ga. 414, 467 S.E.2d 583 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred by denying the defendant's motions for a directed verdict or JNOV on the issue of attorney fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 because the jury found no bad faith in the underlying quiet title action between the parties and the mere fact that the defendant's action had caused an issue which later required litigation to correct did not in and of itself provide a basis for an award; plus, any conduct during litigation could not support an award under <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11. Bowen v. Laird, 348 Ga. App. 1, 821 S.E.2d 105 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unbroken chain of title not established.</b> - In order to show unbroken chain of title, it was necessary for plaintiff to show that persons who deeded the land were the heirs-at-law of the prior owner who had died intestate; because plaintiff failed to establish this fact, the court was not required to find in his favor, and involuntary dismissal of the action was not in error. Smith v. Georgia Kaolin Co., 269 Ga. 475, 498 S.E.2d 266 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Landowner's right to property established.</b> - Findings entered by a Special Master, which determined that the disputed portion of an alley belonged to a landowner, and not the neighbors, by operation of the landowner's prior recorded deed, was not clearly erroneous, as: (1) the landowner received the property via a valid deed; (2) the neighbors failed to put the landowner on notice of their claim; and (3) the neighbors' claim of possession and use was insufficient. Cernonok v. Kane, 280 Ga. 272, 627 S.E.2d 14 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a dispute over an easement in an action to quiet title filed pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 et seq., the trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiff landowners, finding that they had title to the easement as delineated in the parties' plats, and permanently enjoined defendant adjacent landowners from interfering with use of that easement. Thus, a special master properly concluded that there was not clear and unequivocal evidence of an intention to abandon the easement, which had been acquired by grant, and that the mere nonuse of the easement for a period of time was insufficient to establish its abandonment. Whipple v. Hatcher, 283 Ga. 309, 658 S.E.2d 585 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Landowner's right to property not established.</b> - Judgment of the trial court that a landowner did not have title to property by virtue of a deed was not error because by its express description, the deed upon which the landowner relied did not convey an interest in the subject property; the deed set forth a metes and bounds description that corresponded to the landowner's house and surrounding lot only, and the description did not include the subject property. Bailey v. Moten, 289 Ga. 897, 717 S.E.2d 205 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Neighbor's right to property established.</b> - Because the neighbors' actual adverse possession was inconsistent with and prevailed over the owners' mere constructive possession under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-5-166(a), the trial court did not err in entering the court's judgment and decree in favor of the neighbors under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60. Sacks v. Martin, 284 Ga. 712, 670 S.E.2d 417 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It was not error for the trial court to adopt the special master's conclusion that title to certain property was vested in a landowner's neighbor because the neighbor's quitclaim deed was the only deed placed before the special master that described an interest in the subject property. Bailey v. Moten, 289 Ga. 897, 717 S.E.2d 205 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tender required.</b> - In cases involving mortgages, Georgia law required that a party first tender the amount due under the note and security deed before seeking the equitable remedy of quiet title; the complaint did not allege that the plaintiff attempted to tender the amount due and defendants refused it, or that the defendants were likely to refuse such an offer. Moreover, the allegations in the complaint did not plausibly support the notion that the plaintiff owned the subject property free and clear, so the plaintiff's quiet title action failed. Warthen v. Litton Loan Servicing LP,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga. Mar. 23, 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Used to remove any cloud of title.</b> - Special master erred in concluding that the property purchaser's action to quiet title was a conventional quia timet employed to quiet title, as that action was used to quiet title as to a deed or other writing which casts a cloud over a title, whereas the property purchaser's action was a quia timet action against all the world; however, no error occurred in denying the property claimant's motion for a jury trial even though an action against the entire world allowed for one, as the evidence did not present a question of fact that required a jury. Gurley v. E. Atlanta Land Co., 276 Ga. 749, 583 S.E.2d 866 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Implied easement not shown.</b> - In submitting a quiet title case to a special master, a trial court did not cede jurisdiction to render a final decision, and was not obligated to accept a special master's erroneous legal conclusion; a trial court properly rejected a special master's finding that an implied easement was established because access to an owner's home across a neighbors' property was unnecessary, but merely convenient, and because the owner's deed made no mention of a plat allegedly relied on by the owner or a right of way bordering the property, and the plat itself was not recorded. Eardley v. McGreevy, 279 Ga. 562, 615 S.E.2d 744 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adverse possession.</b> - In a quiet title action under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 et seq., appellee alleged property owner established adverse possession of a disputed tract because both appellee and a prior lessee used the tract in connection with their business on contiguous property leased from an estate from 1971-1999; appellee acquired title to a lot containing the tract from the estate in 1999. Steinichen v. Stancil, 284 Ga. 580, 669 S.E.2d 109 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of quiet title claim improper.</b> - Trial court erred in dismissing the property owner's quiet title claim because, although the bank tried to reform the deed and void the foreclosure that listed 2253 Dawnville as the property foreclosed upon, and the bank's counsel filed an affidavit of title that the bank intended the deed to encumber 2215 Dawnville, the allegations of the property owner's counterclaim disclosed that the property owner would be entitled to relief if it was determined that the property owner did in fact hold unencumbered legal title to 2215 Dawnville, and that the bank through the filing of the affidavits of title and the foreclosure and resulting deed under power, cast a cloud upon that title. Cronan v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 336 Ga. App. 201, 784 S.E.2d 57 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Special master report properly adopted.</b> - In a quiet title action, the trial court did not err by adopting a special master report because the report was not tainted by a conflict of interest since the special master was appointed by a stipulated conflict waiver agreed upon by the parties and there was sufficient evidence to support that only two tracts of land were conveyed to the purchaser, not four. DeCay v. Houston, 295 Ga. 223, 758 S.E.2d 286 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury trial available.</b> - While a special master erred in concluding the property purchaser's action to quiet title was a conventional quia timet action, and, thus, no jury trial was available to the property claimant, the claimant was not harmed by the error; although a jury trial was available regarding the property purchaser's action in quia timet as against all the world, the property claimant did not show that the evidence presented a question of fact, and, thus, the intervention of a jury was not required. Gurley v. E. Atlanta Land Co., 276 Ga. 749, 583 S.E.2d 866 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When one seeks conventional quia timet, one is not entitled to trial by jury under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-43; when one seeks quia timet against all the world, however, one is entitled by the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66 to a jury trial, but there is no right to a jury trial when a suit at law is converted by amendment into an equitable proceeding. Vatacs Group, Inc. v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 292 Ga. 483, 738 S.E.2d 83 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Planned street parcel conveyed in deed to property owners.</b> - In a quiet title action brought by property owners, a trial court properly found that since the grantor who conveyed to the owners' predecessors-in-title land abutting a planned street parcel that the grantor also owned, but the street was never dedicated, the deed conveyed to the owners the interest that the grantor held in the road since there was no clear expression of a contrary intent. 1845 La Dawn Lane, LLC v. Bowman, 277 Ga. 741, 594 S.E.2d 373 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action to invalidate an allegedly forged quitclaim deed filed by a husband, which transferred an interest in certain property to the husband's wife, summary judgment was erroneously granted to the husband, as a bankruptcy trustee presented sufficient evidence of disputed issues of material fact concerning the husband's equitable claim; hence, the matter was remanded for further proceedings under the Quiet Title Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 et seq. Hurst v. Evans, 284 Ga. App. 274, 643 S.E.2d 824 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Title did not ripen under tax deed.</b> - In a quiet title action under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60, although a corporation with a 1984 tax deed to the property in dispute claimed that ripening of title had occurred under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 48-4-48 as the corporation held the tax deed for the required seven-year period under a former version of the statute, a 1989 amendment that applied expressly to tax deeds executed prior to July 1, 1989, required adverse possession by the tax deed grantee in order for title to ripen. BX Corp. v. Hickory Hill 1185, LLC, 285 Ga. 5, 673 S.E.2d 205 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Consent judgment inappropriate over waterfront property.</b> - As both parties did not actually consent to all of the terms of a consent judgment which purported to resolve the parties' ongoing dispute over title to waterfront property in an action under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60, a trial court erred in issuing the consent judgment; the trial court's consent judgment impermissibly modified a condition precedent to the parties' agreement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action must be brought in county where land lies.</b> - Trial court erred by dismissing a credit union's quiet title action because the two causes of action at issue were neither identical nor did they resolve the same issues as the quiet title action sought to establish the credit union as the legal title holder of the Lee County, Georgia, properties, while the Dougherty County lawsuit sought to hold the credit union monetarily responsible for the allegedly unlawful acquiring of the titles to those and other properties.

<p class="p4"><b>Res judicata.</b> - Trial court did not err in ruling that a church's prior quia timet action under the Quiet Title Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 et seq., barred an heir's action against the church seeking title to the property because the prior action settled the church's ownership interest in the property.

<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of homeowner's claim based on assignment of security deed.</b> - Homeowner's action to quiet title against an assignee of the security deed to the homeowner's property failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the homeowner's security deed had been granted to the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) and then to the assignee and was never held by the lender that had since become defunct. Bank of America, N.A. v.

<p class="p10"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - This section creates an efficient, speedy, and effective means of adjudicating disputed title claims and was intended by the General Assembly to serve as an additional remedy to other legal and equitable actions. Heath v. Stinson, 238 Ga. 364, 233 S.E.2d 178 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A plaintiff in an action to quiet title must assert that he holds some current record title or current prescriptive title,</b> and not only an expectancy, in order to maintain his suit. In re Rivermist Homeowners Ass'n, 244 Ga. 515, 260 S.E.2d 897 (1979); Smith v. Georgia Kaolin Co., 264 Ga. 755, 449 S.E.2d 85 (1994), appeal dismissed, 269 Ga. 475, 498 S.E.2d 266 (1998). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plaintiff in the action to quiet title failed to bring itself within the language of this section where it showed no current claim to an estate of freehold nor an estate of years. In re Rivermist Homeowners Ass'n, 244 Ga. 515, 260 S.E.2d 897 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of quiet title claim improper.</b> - Trial court erred in dismissing the property owner's quiet title claim because, although the bank tried to reform the deed and void the foreclosure that listed 2253 Dawnville as the property foreclosed upon, and the bank's counsel filed an affidavit of title that the bank intended the deed to encumber 2215 Dawnville, the allegations of the property owner's counterclaim disclosed that the property owner would be entitled to relief if it was determined that the property owner did in fact hold unencumbered legal title to 2215 Dawnville, and that the bank through the filing of the affidavits of title and the foreclosure and resulting deed under power, cast a cloud upon that title. Cronan v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 336 Ga. App. 201, 784 S.E.2d 57 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal of homeowner's claim based on assignment of security deed.</b> - Homeowner's action to quiet title against an assignee of the security deed to the homeowner's property failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the homeowner's security deed had been granted to the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) and then to the assignee and was never held by the lender that had since become defunct. Bank of America, N.A. v. Johnson, 299 Ga. 861, 792 S.E.2d 704 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of title.</b> - The Quiet Title Act does not require the same proof of title as an ejectment action. Smith v. Georgia Kaolin Co., 264 Ga. 755, 449 S.E.2d 85 (1994), appeal dismissed, 269 Ga. 475, 498 S.E.2d 266 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to support plaintiff's boundaries.</b> - In a boundary line dispute filed pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-61, the trial court properly entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, two landowners, and against their neighbor, and then denied the neighbor a new trial, or alternatively a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, as: (1) the boundary line indicated on a plat reflecting the locations of monuments on the parcel owned by two landowners complied with the monuments referenced in the original warranty deed; and (2) the neighbor agreed to a special verdict form allowing the jury to find that the plat submitted by the two landowners accurately and sufficiently showed the true boundary line. Dover v. Higgins, 287 Ga. App. 861, 652 S.E.2d 829 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0402, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 237 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>All known heirs not required parties.</b> - Action brought by decedent's grandson to quiet title to real property was not subject to dismissal for failure to join all the known heirs of the decedent. Resseau v. Bland, 268 Ga. 634, 491 S.E.2d 809 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Easement insufficient to support claim.</b> - A homeowner's association was not entitled to bring a quiet title action against a subdivision developer; the association's allegations that the developer should convey future title and that the association had an easement were insufficient to support a claim for quiet title, as a petition to quiet title could not depend upon an easement. Dykes Paving &amp; Constr. Co. v. Hawk's Landing Homeowners Ass'n, 282 Ga. 305, 647 S.E.2d 579 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Res judicata.</b> - Trial court did not err in ruling that a church's prior quia timet action under the Quiet Title Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 et seq., barred an heir's action against the church seeking title to the property because the prior action settled the church's ownership interest in the property.

<p class="p10"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tax sale of property proper.</b> - In a purchaser's quiet title action against the executor of a testatrix's estate, the trial court did not err in adopting the report of a special master and in decreeing that fee simple title to the land was vested in the purchaser because the purchaser acquired title to the property by virtue of a tax sale and deed, which was conducted in accordance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 48-4-1 et seq.; a title search showed the testatrix's nephew as holding record title to the property, but out of caution, both the nephew and the executor were served with notice of the tax sale, the tax commissioner met with the executor prior to the sale and offered to accept payment for the back taxes, but the executor failed to do so, and the property was sold to the purchaser, with the overage going to the nephew, and the executor did not timely seek to exercise a right of redemption under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 48-4-40. Mann v. Blalock, 286 Ga. 541, 690 S.E.2d 375 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Quiet title proceeding procedurally deficient.</b> - In a purchaser's quiet title action against the executor of a testatrix's estate, the trial court did not err in adopting the report of a special master and in decreeing that fee simple title to the land was vested in the purchaser because the trial court was authorized to find that the executor's prior quiet title action failed to convey any interest in the property to the executor and to decree that the judgment entered in that action be removed as a cloud upon the purchaser's title when the prior quiet title proceeding was procedurally deficient; the quiet title petition was not verified as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-62(b), it did not include a plat of survey of the land as required by <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-62(c), a lis pendens was not filed contemporaneously with the filing of the petition as required by <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-62(d), the petition was not submitted to an authorized special master as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-63, and the record failed to establish service on any party as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-65(b).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Owner had granted deeds to secure debt had no legal title to property.</b> - In a borrower's quiet title action against two lenders, the documents attached to the complaint and answer reflected that the borrower had granted two deeds to secure debt to the lenders, and the borrower therefore did not have legal title to the property absent evidence that the borrower had satisfied the debts; therefore, dismissal of the borrower's petition under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-62 was proper. The trial court was not required to refer the case to a special master prior to dismissal for failure to state a claim. Montia v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., 341 Ga. App. 867, 801 S.E.2d 907 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence did not establish rightful owner of property.</b> - Trial court erred in finding that a neighbor was the rightful owner of certain property because there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the neighbor owned the disputed property either by deed or by adverse possession; the legal description of the property contained in the neighbor's deed did not include the disputed property, and since the evidence showed that, at most, the neighbor made a claim to the disputed property for only eighteen years before being challenged by the landowners, the neighbor's claim to have gained prescriptive title to the property through adverse possession under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 44-5-161 and 44-5-165 failed as a matter of law.

<p class="p4">Evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that landowners did not own the disputed property because the landowners' occasional maintenance and use of the disputed property did not amount to the type of exclusive possession for twenty years that would support a claim for prescriptive title under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 44-5-161 and 44-5-165.

<p class="p10"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Demand for jury trial must be filed prior to ruling by special master.</b> - In proceedings to remove a cloud on title, a demand for a jury trial cannot be filed after the special master has ruled on the questions of law and fact in the case and submitted his report to the trial court. The judgment entered by the trial court is thus a final judgment to which a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days. Thornton v. Reb Properties, Inc., 237 Ga. 59, 226 S.E.2d 741 (1976); Higdon v. Gates, 238 Ga. 105, 231 S.E.2d 345 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">This section requires counsel to demand a jury trial for the resolution of any factual issues in the case prior to the time it is heard by the special master. If no demand is filed prior to the time he hears the case, the special master is the arbiter of law and fact and decides all issues in the case unless the master on his own initiative requires a trial by jury of any question of fact. Thornton v. Reb Properties, Inc., 237 Ga. 59, 226 S.E.2d 741 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a demand for a jury trial was filed before the case was heard by a special master, the trial court did not err in vacating its initial order adopting the special master's report and correctly ordered that a jury trial be held. Addison v. Reece, 263 Ga. 631, 436 S.E.2d 663 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the defendant demanded a jury trial after the start of the hearing in front of a special master, the superior court did not err in approving and adopting the special master's order denying as untimely the defendant's demand. Griffeth v. Griffin, 245 Ga. App. 619, 538 S.E.2d 521 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, in a dispute over the ownership of a parcel of land between a landowner and a railroad, the landowner timely demanded a jury trial before the special master to which the case was referred ruled, it had to be decided whether there was a genuine issue of material fact for a jury to decide, and, because the railroad did not show actual or constructive possession of the disputed land as a matter of law, there was such an issue, and it was error for the trial court to deny the landowner's request for a jury. Watkins v. Hartwell R.R. Co., 278 Ga. 42, 597 S.E.2d 377 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit between a church and a minister, the trial court's order striking a portion of the minister's complaint was not a final adjudication of all claims, thereby entitling the minister to appeal. It was only a determination that the minister had waived the right to a jury trial under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66 by not filing a jury demand before a hearing was held by a special master, and not that any of the claims themselves had been waived or otherwise disposed of. Rhymes v. E. Atlanta Church of God, Inc., 284 Ga. 145, 663 S.E.2d 670 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a quiet title action, a party's attorney presented a jury demand at the special master's hearing and in the superior court hearing stating that the action was filed prior to the special master's hearing, and no evidence to the contrary was offered; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66, therefore, a jury trial was required on issues of fact. Wyatt v. Hizer, 337 Ga. App. 767, 788 S.E.2d 866 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Claims outside of special master's jurisdiction not waived.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66, a special master had jurisdiction only over a church's quiet title petition, not its other claims against a minister alleging conversion of personal property and money. Therefore, the church did not waive those other claims by not raising them before the master. Rhymes v. E. Atlanta Church of God, Inc., 284 Ga. 145, 663 S.E.2d 670 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal for failure to state claim with submission to special master.</b> - In a borrower's quiet title action against two lenders, the documents attached to the complaint and answer reflected that the borrower had granted two deeds to secure debt to the lenders, and the borrower therefore did not have legal title to the property absent evidence that the borrower had satisfied the debts; therefore, dismissal of the borrower's petition under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-62 was proper. The trial court was not required to refer the case to a special master prior to dismissal for failure to state a claim. Montia v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., 341 Ga. App. 867, 801 S.E.2d 907 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to provide jury trial not error.</b> - Since a special master found no question of fact to exist and the owners did not make present the existence of a question of fact on appeal, the failure to provide a jury trial pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66, even if timely requested, was not error. Sacks v. Martin, 284 Ga. 712, 670 S.E.2d 417 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a property owner's quiet title action against a tax sale buyer, the owner was not entitled to a jury trial; even assuming that the action was quia timet against all the world, the owner failed to demonstrate an issue of fact requiring jury resolution. Mancuso v. TDGA, LLC, 301 Ga. 671, 802 S.E.2d 248 (2017), cert. denied, 200 L. Ed. 2d 518, 86 U.S.L.W. 3485 (U.S. 2018), cert. denied, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 2010, 200 L. Ed. 2d 518 (U.S. 2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of special master required.</b> - In a quiet title action, the trial court erred by failing to appoint a special master because Georgia's Quiet Title Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 et seq., requires a trial court to appoint a special master and for that special master to make a report of the special master's findings to the trial court. DOCO Credit Union v. Chambers, 330 Ga. App. 633, 768 S.E.2d 808 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority of special master and judge.</b> - In a quiet title action, there was no merit to the contention that only the special master had jurisdiction to rule upon a motion for summary judgment. In submitting a quiet title case to a special master, a trial court did not cede jurisdiction to render a final decision; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-67 gave only the trial court authority to issue the final decree. Harbuck v. Houston County, 284 Ga. 4, 662 S.E.2d 107 (2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 641, 172 L. Ed. 2d 613 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Special master, in accordance with the special master's complete jurisdiction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66, was entitled to review the pleadings and evidence to determine the valid interests in real property because an amended pleading properly filed by a bank included claims that a grantee's foreclosure sale was improper and that title under the grantee's security deed had reverted to a promisor pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-80(a)(1). MPP Invs., Inc. v. Cherokee Bank, N.A., 288 Ga. 558, 707 S.E.2d 485 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In submitting a quiet title case to the special master, the trial court did not cede jurisdiction to render a final decision as although the trial court was not required to hear exceptions to the special master's report, the trial court had to independently evaluate the correctness of the report before adopting the report as a judgment and it was the trial court, not the special master, who ordered disbursement of excess funds following the tax sale. Republic Title Company, LLC v. Freeport Title and Guaranty, Inc., 351 Ga. App. 408, 829 S.E.2d 172 (2019), cert. denied, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 168 (Ga. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Master's authority to set deadlines.</b> - In a quiet title action that was referred to a special master, the master's setting of a deadline for the parties to file motions to disqualify did not violate any statute or rule, Ga. Unif. Super. Ct. R. 25.3, nor did the setting of the deadline prevent the special master from fulfilling the master's separate obligation to ensure that the master was impartial and disinterested. Boyd v. JohnGalt Holdings, LLC, 294 Ga. 640, 755 S.E.2d 675 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Demand for jury trial must be filed prior to special master hearing the case.</b> - Although landowners who were defending a prescriptive easement suit by quia timet had the right to demand a jury trial of any question of fact, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66, when the landowners failed to file a jury demand before the special master heard the case, the special master became the arbiter of law and fact. McGregor v. River Pond Farm, LLC, 312 Ga. App. 652, 719 S.E.2d 546 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Quiet title action within special master jurisdiction.</b> - It was not error for the trial court to adopt the special master's conclusion that title to certain property was vested in a landowner's neighbor because the neighbor's quitclaim deed was the only deed placed before the special master that described an interest in the subject property. Bailey v. Moten, 289 Ga. 897, 717 S.E.2d 205 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Report of findings to judge.</b> - Provision in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-66 that the special master make a report of findings to the judge did not mandate a separate finding or conclusion as to each claim or defense in taxpayers' claim against an assignee of a purchaser of their property at a tax sale. Boyd v. JohnGalt Holdings, LLC, 294 Ga. 640, 755 S.E.2d 675 (2014). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a defendant who asserted a quiet title claim against the plaintiffs requested a special master, the trial court was required to submit the claim to a special master, and no notice or hearing on the matter was required; once submitted, the special master had complete jurisdiction to determine the quiet title claim.

<p class="p4"><b>Demand for jury trial deemed untimely unless filed prior to consideration by special master.</b> - Where a petitioner fails to file a demand for a jury trial prior to the time the case is heard by a special master, the demand is considered untimely, and will be denied. Brown v. Wilson, 240 Ga. 856, 242 S.E.2d 603 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court retained jurisdiction despite role of special master.</b> - In a quiet title action, there was no merit to the contention that only the special master had jurisdiction to rule upon a motion for summary judgment. In submitting a quiet title case to a special master, a trial court did not cede jurisdiction to render a final decision; O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-67 gave only the trial court authority to issue the final decree. Harbuck v. Houston County, 284 Ga. 4, 662 S.E.2d 107 (2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 641, 172 L. Ed. 2d 613 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of special master required.</b> - In a quiet title action, the trial court erred by failing to appoint a special master because Georgia's Quiet Title Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-60 et seq., requires a trial court to appoint a special master and for that special master to make a report of the special master's findings to the trial court. DOCO Credit Union v. Chambers, 330 Ga. App. 633, 768 S.E.2d 808 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adoption of special master's report.</b> - Trial court did not err by failing to grant an investment company's motion for an oral hearing on the company's exceptions to a special master's report because a trial court was entitled to enter judgment at any time the court chose and could have done so before any exceptions were filed by the company. Therefore, if a trial court may adopt the special master's report and enter judgment even before a party has a chance to file exceptions to the report, then it cannot be error for the trial court to fail to hold an oral hearing on any exceptions before entering judgment. MPP Invs., Inc. v. Cherokee Bank, N.A., 288 Ga. 558, 707 S.E.2d 485 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dismissal for failure to describe land triggers res judicata in later action.</b> - Where petition to quiet title was dismissed for failure to describe land, petitioner was barred by res judicata from instituting a subsequent action for declaratory and injunctive relief based on same facts; res judicata applies not only when case was decided on merits, but also when it could have been so decided, had the case been handled appropriately by the litigants in the original case. Piedmont Cotton Mills, Inc., v. Woelper, 269 Ga. 109, 498 S.E.2d 255 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellant did not waive objections.</b> - Quiet title case was remanded to the trial court for it to address the merits of the appellant's motion for a new trial as the appellant's failure to file objections before the trial court adopted a special master's report did not bar the appellant from objecting to the trial court's judgment in a motion for new trial or on appeal since O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-67 made no provision for filing exceptions to the special master's report and did not require a trial court to provide notice to the parties and to conduct a hearing before adopting the special master's report. Steinichen v. Stancil, 281 Ga. 75, 635 S.E.2d 158 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No provision for filing exceptions.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-67 makes no provision for filing exceptions to a special master's report in a suit seeking to quiet title, and does not require a trial court to provide notice to the parties and to conduct a hearing before adopting a special master's report; although a trial court is not required to hear exceptions to a special master's report, the trial court must independently evaluate the correctness of the report before adopting it as the judgment of the trial court.

<p class="p4"><b>The award of compensation to the special master is a part of the costs</b> under this section and does not affect the finality of the judgment for purposes of appeal. Green v. Kaplan, 237 Ga. 602, 229 S.E.2d 369 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction to order special master fees.</b> - Filing of a notice of appeal in the underlying action deprived a trial court of jurisdiction to thereafter order the payment of interim fees to a special master because ultimate responsibility for the fees was directly related to the resolution of the quiet title action that was not yet fully resolved at the time the trial court taxed the special master's fee as costs of the action. Under such circumstances, the award of the special master's fee was improper. Avren v. Garten, 289 Ga. 186, 710 S.E.2d 130 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No hearing required.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-68 did not require a hearing before the trial court as to the reasonableness of a special master's fees and costs; moreover, the trial court had discretion to apportion costs between the parties, and the allocation of costs was not controlled by which party prevailed. In part because taxpayers did not prevail on their claims against an assignee of the title to their property, the trial court did not err in assigning them 25 percent of the special master's fees.

Mandeville v. First Nat'l Bank, 206 Ga. 426, 57 S.E.2d 553 (1950); Gunby v. Harper, 216 Ga. 94, 114 S.E.2d 856 (1960). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly granted relief sought by amended petition for interpleader and for certain injunctive relief against contractor and other named persons who had supplied him building material and performed labor for him in repairing a building which the petitioners owned, and who had instituted proceedings to foreclose liens against the repaired property. Bryant v. Haygood, 216 Ga. 561, 118 S.E.2d 469 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Concerning conflicting claims to a fund.</b> - It is essential to the maintenance of a petition for interpleader that there be at least two persons, having conflicting claims, each apparently well founded, to a fund in the hands of a person having no interest in or claim thereon, and who, as between the conflicting claimants, is perfectly indifferent. Davis v. Davis, 96 Ga. 136, 21 S.E. 1002 (1895); Miller Hotel Co. v. Chastaine, 183 Ga. 172, 188 S.E. 4 (1936); Mullins v. Autry, 200 Ga. 645, 38 S.E.2d 390 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The general doctrine is, that interpleader lies, where two or more persons claim the same thing, under different titles, or in separate interests, from another person, who, not claiming any title or interest therein himself, and not knowing to which of the claimants he ought of right to render the duty claimed, or to deliver the property claimed, is either molested by an action or actions brought against him, or fears he may suffer injury, from the conflicting claims of the parties against him. Johnson v. Harbison-Walker Mining Co., 181 Ga. 630, 183 S.E. 791 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Conflicting claims must be of such character as to justify a reasonable doubt or reasonable apprehension of danger in order that resort may be had to a court of equity. Reed v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 206 Ga. 604, 58 S.E.2d 183 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Petition for interpleader brought by insurer, alleging that the insured changed the beneficiary named in the policy prior to his death, without alleging when or how the change was made, setting forth a copy of the policy, or stating whether or not the insured reserved to himself the right to change the beneficiary, was insufficient to inform the court of the nature, character, and foundation of the claim so as to enable the court to determine whether or not an interpleader was essential to the plaintiff's protection, and the trial court erred in overruling the general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) to the petition. Lowery v. Independent Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 209 Ga. 753, 76 S.E.2d 5 (1953).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conflicting claims to church funds.</b> - Trial court properly granted a bank's petition for interpleader with regard to a dispute between church members over funds held by the bank because interpleader was the appropriate method to resolve the dispute over control of the funds since the dispute was secular and not of a religious nature and the resolution of the dispute did not necessitate an impermissible intrusion or excessive entanglement into ecclesiastical matters. The bank was authorized to file the petition based on the terms of the bank's deposit agreement and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-90 once the bank learned of the dispute over the church funds. Nash v. United Bank-Thomaston, 319 Ga. App. 179, 734 S.E.2d 238 (2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In the hands of a disinterested person.</b> - In the case of a petition of strict interpleader, the petitioner must be an indifferent stakeholder, without interest in the subject matter. Phillips v. Kelly, 176 Ga. 111, 167 S.E. 281 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A necessary ingredient of equitable interpleader is that the stakeholder must be disinterested.</b> Midland Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Emerson, 121 Ga. App. 427, 174 S.E.2d 211 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One who seeks the aid of a court by petition for interpleader must claim no right in opposition</b> to the claimants to the fund. Holland v. Sterling, 214 Ga. 583, 105 S.E.2d 894 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the defendant is not disinterested, as where he denies liability to the plaintiff as well as the other two parties, the action cannot be classified as a pleading for equitable interpleader. Midland Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Emerson, 121 Ga. App. 427, 174 S.E.2d 211 (1970). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The petition in the nature of interpleader cannot be maintained where plaintiffs allege that neither of defendants has any right or title to, or any interest in, the subject matter of the action, nor unless the relief sought is equitable relief. Phillips v. Kelly, 176 Ga. 111, 167 S.E. 281 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>2. Liability of Petitioner</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It is essential to an interpleader that the plaintiff be liable to only one of the defendants</b> and never by any possibility to both. Finance Co. v. Jones Co., 141 Ga. 619, 81 S.E. 1033 (1914); Lilley v. Nixon, 214 Ga. 548, 105 S.E.2d 716 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To entitle a person to a petition of interpleader, he must be in a position in which he is liable to one of two or more persons, who claim from him the same debt or duty; and he claims no right in opposition to the claimants or either of them; and he does not know to whom he ought, of right, to render the debt or duty. Phillips v. Kelly, 176 Ga. 111, 167 S.E. 281 (1932). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where there is a question of double liability and not of double vexation for one liability, the plaintiff is not in that disinterested attitude as to the conflicting claimants which is essential to a petition of interpleader. Lilley v. Nixon, 214 Ga. 548, 105 S.E.2d 716 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the question is not to which one of two or more claimants a single duty or debt should be rendered or paid or the same property should be delivered, but whether the person filing the proceeding is liable to each of two holders of different negotiable promissory notes transferred to them respectively before due, on which separate suits have been brought, whether they are not bona fide holders for value and without notice, and whether the debtor has a defense as against each or either of them, arising out of transactions with the original payee, this presents no case of a double claim to one debt or liability but a case of whether there is a double liability, and does not authorize a proceeding for interpleader proper. Gardner v. Haas, Howell &amp; Dodd, Inc., 178 Ga. 685, 173 S.E. 863 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Petition by the owner of a tract of real estate, seeking to require two brokers with whom the plaintiff had listed the property, to interplead and set up their claims for one commission growing out of a sale of the property, failed to set forth a cause of action for interpleader, since two separate contracts of listing were alleged and there was a possibility under the allegations of the petition that the plaintiff might be liable to both parties. Lilley v. Nixon, 214 Ga. 548, 105 S.E.2d 716 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the proceeds of a life insurance policy are claimed by the insured's mother, as the original beneficiary, by the insured's wife, as the new beneficiary at the insured's direction to the insurer, and by the children, based on an instrument by the wife and mother establishing a trust for the benefit of the children, the essential for interpleaders are present. Kimbrell v. Lincoln Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 217 Ga. 335, 122 S.E.2d 94 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>3. Existence of Reasonable Danger or Doubt</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Real doubt or danger alone authorizes one to file a petition for interpleader.</b> - It must appear from the allegations of the petition that the conflicting claims of the defendants are of such character as to render it doubtful or dangerous for the plaintiff to act; and in order to do this it is necessary that such claims be set forth so as to inform the court of their nature, character, and foundation, certainly to the extent of enabling the court to determine whether or not an interpleader is essential to the plaintiff 's protection. Mullins v. Autry, 200 Ga. 645, 38 S.E.2d 390 (1946); Lilley v. Nixon, 214 Ga. 548, 105 S.E.2d 716 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When two or more persons claim the same thing, by different and separate interests, and another person, not knowing to which of the claimants he ought of right to render a debt or duty, or to deliver property in his custody, fears he may be hurt by some of them, he may exhibit a petition of interpleader against them. Johnson v. Harbison-Walker Mining Co., 181 Ga. 630, 183 S.E. 791 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>But a stakeholder is not entitled to protection by a court to the extent of being saved from all shadow of risk;</b> and so where he is in possession of all the facts and there is no question of law which is reasonably debatable, his petition for interpleader should be denied. Citizens Bank v. Middlebrooks, 209 Ga. 330, 72 S.E.2d 298 (1952); Lowery v. Independent Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 209 Ga. 753, 76 S.E.2d 5 (1953); Lilley v. Nixon, 214 Ga. 548, 105 S.E.2d 716 (1958). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In order for a mere stakeholder to invoke the aid of a court of equity by interpleader, it is not necessary that suits actually be filed by all of the claimants, or that there will necessarily be double liability; one of the objects to be accomplished by interpleader is to avoid the danger of a double vexation against a single liability. Johnson v. Harbison-Walker Mining Co., 181 Ga. 630, 183 S.E. 791 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a holder knows all the facts, and the questions of law are not intricate or debatable, a petition for interpleader will not lie; but it is not incumbent upon the holder "to decide at his peril either close questions of fact, or nice questions of law"; and in such a case he may require the parties at interest to set up their claims for determination. Cannon v. Williams, 194 Ga. 808, 22 S.E.2d 838 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Therefore, the doubt or danger that would authorize an interpleader must be reasonable.</b> Daniel v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 182 Ga. 384, 185 S.E. 696 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Before one occupying the situation of a stakeholder can call upon adverse claimants of a fund in his hands to interplead, he must satisfactorily show to the court that their claims have such a foundation in law as will create a reasonable doubt as to his safety in undertaking to determine for himself to whom the fund belongs. Smith v. Folsom, 190 Ga. 460, 9 S.E.2d 824 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And the doubt or danger may arise either in law or in fact as to the person to whom the money should be paid.</b> Daniel v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 182 Ga. 384, 185 S.E. 696 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It must appear from the allegations of the petition that the conflicting claims of the defendants are of such character as to render it doubtful or dangerous for the plaintiff to act; and in order to do this it is necessary that such claims be set forth so as to inform the court of their nature, character, and foundation, certainly to extent of enabling the court to determine whether or not an interpleader is essential to the plaintiff's protection.

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Effect of Petition Generally</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The complainant in a petition of interpleader merely stirs up a war and then leaves the real belligerents to fight it out,</b> he retiring from the scene to repose in dignified ease, holding, the while, the prize which is to reward the victor. Perkins &amp; Littlefield v. Trippe, 40 Ga. 225 (1869); Smith v. Folsom, 190 Ga. 460, 9 S.E.2d 824 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the owner of property has in his possession funds due under a contract for the erection of a house, which are claimed by the materialmen under an asserted equitable assignment from the contractor and by the trustee of the contractor, who has since been adjudicated a bankrupt, the owner may bring the funds into court and maintain a petition for interpleader to compel the conflicting claimants to litigate between themselves their respective rights thereto. Smith v. Folsom, 190 Ga. 460, 9 S.E.2d 824 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where petition for interpleader showed that the defendant insurer owed the beneficiary of two life insurance policies purchased by the deceased an undisputed amount, that two persons have made demands on it for the payment of such proceeds, each claiming to be the legal beneficiary of the policies, and that their conflicting claims are of such a character as to render it doubtful or dangerous for it to act, the judgment permitting the defendant to pay the full amount due on the policies into the registry of the court and then be discharged from further liability was not erroneous. Sanders v. Progressive Life Ins. Co., 212 Ga. 674, 94 S.E.2d 871 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And on the trial of interpleader each of the claimants occupies the position of plaintiff,</b> and must recover on the strength of his own title rather than on the weakness of the other's title. Johnson v. Harbison-Walker Mining Co., 181 Ga. 630, 183 S.E. 791 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After a decree has been entered, ordering the petitioner to pay the fund in question into court and ordering the claimants to interplead and set up their claims to the fund, a suit in interpleader becomes, in effect, a proceeding between the claimants alone as adversaries to determine who is entitled to the fund, and the verdict was properly limited to the determination of this issue. Smith v. Folsom, 190 Ga. 460, 9 S.E.2d 824 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interpleader actions may be instituted in Georgia under this article or under </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>9-11-22. Stone v. Davis, 242 Ga. 17, 247 S.E.2d 756 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The remedy for interpleader provided for in <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-22 is in addition to and in no way supersedes or limits the remedy of equitable interpleader provided for in this article. Stone v. Davis, 242 Ga. 17, 247 S.E.2d 756 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section 9-11-22 has broadened and liberalized the rules relating to the remedy of interpleader</b> so as to render the technicalities formally associated with the equitable remedy of a strict bill of interpleader no longer applicable to complaints tried under that section. Stone v. Davis, 242 Ga. 17, 247 S.E.2d 756 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Permission to interplead a trustee need not be secured from the court of bankruptcy</b> which appointed him, since an interpleader suit is not an interference with, and cannot mature into a charge on, the assets of bankrupt. Smith v. Folsom, 190 Ga. 460, 9 S.E.2d 824 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Successor trustee held not entitled to summary judgment.</b> - A successor trustee that brought an interpleader action against the original trustee and a broker, involving $60,000 in compensation which the original trustee was entitled to under a court order, was not entitled to summary judgment. The claims of the two interpled parties were not adverse or competing. The original trustee only claimed compensation under the court order as a trustee, not in any other capacity, while the broker only claimed a fee as a broker. Trust Co. Bank v. Citizens &amp; S. Trust Co., 260 Ga. 124, 390 S.E.2d 589 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court erred in interpreting governing documents.</b> - In an interpleader action, the trial court erred in the court's interpretation of the governing contracts as the funds held by the sheriff for a bail bond corporation were really held on behalf of the owners of the corporation in the owners' individual capacities; thus, a judgment creditor of the individuals was entitled to the funds. Freund v. Warren, 320 Ga. App. 765, 740 S.E.2d 727 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Time of filing.</b> - The petition should be filed before either claimant has had his right established by judgment. Brown v. Wilson, 56 Ga. 534 (1876); Moore v. Hill, 59 Ga. 760 (1877). See 7 Enc. Dig. 753.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discharge of party appropriate.</b> - Because a husband's counterclaim for reimbursement of the husband's premium payments did not make the insurer an interested stakeholder so as to preclude its interpleader action, the trial court erred in denying the insurer's motion for discharge under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-3-90(a). Am. Gen. Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Vance, 297 Ga. App. 677, 678 S.E.2d 135 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">The award to a personal injury plaintiff of attorney fees and costs incurred by the plaintiff (defendant's administrator) in bringing the action was within the court's discretion, since the trial court had already allowed the administrator to recover her costs from the fund deposited in the court.

<p class="p10"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - The principle upon which courts exercising equitable jurisdiction interfere and grant relief is to suppress useless litigation; to prevent multiplicity of suits; to restrain oppressive litigation and to prevent irreparable mischief. Bond v. Little, 10 Ga. 395 (1851); Sutton v. Adams, 180 Ga. 48, 178 S.E. 365 (1934); Consumers Fin. Corp. v. Lamb, 217 Ga. 359, 122 S.E.2d 101 (1961); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hill, 218 Ga. 430, 128 S.E.2d 321 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The complainant's right must be satisfactorily established at law before equity will interfere.</b> Bond v. Little, 10 Ga. 395 (1851).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Trial court approval for suit required.</b> - Trial court properly summarily dismissed an attorney's living trust's action against a beach cottage purchaser because a bill of peace and perpetual injunction had been entered and the trust sued the purchaser without obtaining trial court approval, as required by the bill of peace and perpetual injunction. Moreton Rolleston, Jr., Living Trust v. Kennedy, 277 Ga. 541, 591 S.E.2d 834, cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1042, 124 S. Ct. 2168, 158 L. Ed. 2d 732 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And where the relief can be clearly afforded at law, this section does not apply.</b> Guess v. Stone Mt. Granite &amp; Ry., 67 Ga. 215 (1881); Mayor of Gainesville v. Dean, 124 Ga. 750, 53 S.E. 183 (1906). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While avoidance of a multiplicity of suits may, in a proper case, be considered as an independent ground of equitable jurisdiction, and not a mere auxiliary to other equities present, it does not alone create an equitable cause of action, regardless of other circumstances. Dobbs v. FDIC, 187 Ga. 569, 1 S.E.2d 672 (1939). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the acts of the heir's agent, in charge of operating the decedent's corporation, in mismanaging the corporation, substantially the entire stock of which was owned by the estate, were continuous, still threatened and directly affected the value of the stock, whether the alleged acts are deemed trespasses or waste, it was unnecessary to go further and allege that the defendant was insolvent, since equity is empowered to enjoin such acts, where they would otherwise be likely to give rise to multiplicity of separate suits by the individual heirs against the agent. Shingler v. Shingler, 184 Ga. 671, 192 S.E. 824 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Attorney General shall be authorized to investigate suspected, alleged, and reported violations of this article. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating this article, then the Attorney General may bring a civil action against such person under this article. The Attorney General may delegate authority to a district attorney or other appropriate official of a local government to investigate violations that may have resulted in damages to such local government under Code Section 23-3-121 and may delegate to the local government the authority to bring a civil action on its own behalf, or on behalf of any subdivision of such local government, to recover damages sustained by such local government as a result of such violations, as well as all multiple damages, costs, expenses, attorney's fees, and civil penalties available under Code Section 23-3-121. The Attorney General may delegate to a district attorney or local government the authority to pursue an action brought by a private person under subsection (b) of this Code section. Notwithstanding any such delegation of authority, the Attorney General shall retain the authority to continue or discontinue the prosecution of any such action and to withdraw any such authority previously delegated to a district attorney or local government. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject to the exclusions set forth in this Code section, a civil action under this article may also be brought by a private person upon written approval by the Attorney General. A civil action shall be brought in the name of the State of Georgia or local government, as applicable. The civil action may be dismissed only if the Attorney General gives written consent to the dismissal stating the reasons for consenting to such dismissal and the court enters an order approving the dismissal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Attorney General by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. The complaint shall be filed in camera and under seal, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The state or, if delegated the authority by the Attorney General, local government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after the Attorney General receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) The state or, if delegated the authority by the Attorney General, the local government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2) of this subsection. Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this Code section until 30 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) Before the expiration of the 60 day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the state or local government shall: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(A) Proceed with the civil action, in which case the civil action shall be conducted by the state or local government; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(B) Notify the court that it declines to take over the civil action, in which case the person bringing the civil action shall have the right to proceed with the civil action. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(5) When a person brings a civil action under this subsection, no person other than the state or, if delegated the authority by the Attorney General, the local government may intervene or bring a related civil action based on the facts underlying the pending civil action. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(6) Any evidence and information provided to the Attorney General or his or her designee, including any district attorney or local government, by a private person in connection with an action under this Code section shall not constitute public records and shall be exempt from disclosure under Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50. Any such evidence also shall be protected by the common interest privilege and work product doctrine. To effectuate the law enforcement purposes of this article in combating fraud and false claims directed at the public's funds, it is the public policy of this state that private persons be authorized to take actions to provide to the Attorney General or local government such information and evidence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the state or local government elects to intervene and proceeds with the civil action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the civil action and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing such civil action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the civil action, subject to the limitations set forth in this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) If the Attorney General has consented to a dismissal or elected not to proceed with a civil action, a local government may dismiss the civil action, notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the civil action, if the person has been notified by the local government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) The state or local government may settle the civil action with the defendant, notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the civil action, if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) Upon a showing by the state or local government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the civil action would interfere with or unduly delay the state or local government's litigation of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(A) Limiting the number of witnesses the person may call; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(B) Limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(C) Limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(D) Otherwise limiting the participation of the person in the litigation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the civil action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation of the person in the litigation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the state or local government elects not to proceed with the civil action, the person who initiated the civil action shall have the right to conduct the civil action. If the state or local government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the civil action and shall be supplied, without cost, with copies of all deposition transcripts. When a person proceeds with the civil action, the court may nevertheless permit the state or local government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether or not the state or local government proceeds with the civil action, upon a showing by the state or local government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the civil action would interfere with the state or local government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60 day period upon a further showing in camera that the state or local government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence, and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that becomes final shall be conclusive on all parties to a civil action under this Code section. For purposes of this subsection, a finding or conclusion shall be deemed final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Where the civil action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the civil action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing; in a legislative, administrative, or State Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing such civil action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) If the state or local government does not proceed with a civil action under this Code section, the person bringing the civil action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages.

If the person bringing the civil action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of this article, such person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the civil action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the State of Georgia to continue the civil action, represented by the Attorney General or local government attorney to whom the Attorney General has delegated authority. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

During the pendency of the petition, the court may stay, as it deems proper, compliance with the demand and the running of the time allowed for compliance with the demand. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>History of section generally.</b> - This section appears to have been codified from the decision in Smith v. Dobbins, 87 Ga. 303, 13 S.E. 496 (1891), where it was held that where several executions are levied upon the property of the same defendant, and one person files a separate claim in resistance to each levy, such claimant is entitled to proceed in equity against all the plaintiffs in execution, where the validity of the executions all involved the same question. Dobbs v. FDIC, 187 Ga. 569, 1 S.E.2d 672 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - This section allowing actions to be joined in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits is primarily for the convenience of parties to the case; and according to a number of authorities, whether it will be allowed is a question largely to be determined by the circumstances in the case. Lyle v. Keehn, 195 Ga. 508, 24 S.E.2d 655 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In equitable proceedings a judge of the superior court is empowered to consolidate two or more cases,</b> in order to avoid useless consumption of the time of the court and needless expense to the taxpayers. O'Malley v. Wilson, 182 Ga. 97, 185 S.E. 109 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This section applies only where there is one common right,</b> and one is asserting the right against many or many against one; it does not apply where there is only one party plaintiff and one party defendant. Walker Elec. Co. v. Walton, 203 Ga. 246, 46 S.E.2d 184 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>And distinct and separate claims of or against different persons may not be joined in the same action,</b> but where there is one common right to be established by or against several, equity will determine the matter as to all parties in one action. Lyle v. Keehn, 195 Ga. 508, 24 S.E.2d 655 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where there is no semblance of a conspiracy among the different defendants, and no common intent or act, this section affords no support for a multifarious petition. Crutcher v. Crawford Land Co., 220 Ga. 298, 138 S.E.2d 580 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>

<p class="p4">All persons who are directly or consequentially interested in the event of the suit are properly made parties to a petition in equity, so as to prevent a multiplicity of suits by or against parties at once or successively affected by the original case. Hermann v. Mobley, 172 Ga. 380, 158 S.E. 38 (1931); Benton v. Turk, 188 Ga. 710, 4 S.E.2d 580 (1939); Hyde v.

<p class="p4">There is no misjoinder of parties or of causes of action, even if the petition concerns things of a different nature against several defendants whose rights are distinct, if it sets forth one connected interest among them all, centering in the point in issue in the case. Hermann v. Mobley, 172 Ga. 380, 158 S.E. 38 (1931); City of Atlanta v. Aycock, 205 Ga. 441, 53 S.E.2d 744 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An equitable petition is not multifarious because all of the defendants are not interested in all of the matters contained in the suit; it is sufficient if each party has an interest in some matter in the suit which is common to all, and that they are connected with the others. Dobbs v. FDIC, 187 Ga. 569, 1 S.E.2d 672 (1939); Hyde v. Atlanta Woolen Mills Corp., 204 Ga. 450, 50 S.E.2d 52 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">For a party seeking to obtain possession of a disputed tract of land to join a third party assenting a superior claim to possession, it is not necessary that the interest of the parties be identical; the test is the common interest in the subject matter of the litigation, the property of which the plaintiff seeks to be put in possession, and the common interest of each of the defendants is to defeat that effort of the plaintiff and have possession for himself.

<p class="p4">Where petition asserted as to all defendants that the property conveyed to them by the principal defendant was without any legal consideration and purchased with funds stolen from the petitioner, the issue as to that question was common to all of the defendants, and the petition was not subject to the grounds of special demurrer (now motion to dismiss) as to misjoinder of parties and causes of action and multifariousness. Hyde v. Atlanta Woolen Mills Corp., 204 Ga. 450, 50 S.E.2d 52 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the plaintiffs have a common interest against all of the defendants in a suit as to one or more of the questions raised by it, so as to make them all necessary parties for the purpose of enforcing that common interest, the circumstance of some of the defendants being subject to distinct liabilities in respect to different branches of the subject matter, will not render the bill multifarious. Myers v. Grant, 212 Ga. 677, 95 S.E.2d 9 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under this rule, a few of the members of an unincorporated association, such as a trade union, may sue in the name or in behalf of all the members, where all by virtue of their membership have a common right or interest in the contract or other subject matter of the suit. The fact that the individual interests of the plaintiffs may in some respects differ, or that all do not have an interest in all the matters embraced in such an equitable suit, will not, as to individual plaintiffs, render the petition multifarious or subject to attack for misjoinder of parties or causes of action, if each of the plaintiffs has an essential interest common to all, with a common connection and right against the defendant. O'Jay Spread Co. v. Hicks, 185 Ga. 507, 195 S.E. 564 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A suit in equity, based on separate and distinct claims against different persons, where there is no common right to be established, will be dismissed on demurrer (now motion to dismiss) on the ground of multifariousness.

<p class="p4">Where no common right or interest is shown, the alleged insolvency of the defendant in the petition for consolidation will not confer a right of consolidation in the plaintiffs.

<p class="p4">The fact that the individual interests of the plaintiffs may in some respects differ, or that all do not have an interest in all the matters embraced in such an equitable suit, will not, as to individual plaintiffs, render the petition multifarious or subject to attack for misjoinder of parties or causes of action, if each of the plaintiffs has an essential interest common to all, with a common connection and right against the defendant. City of Atlanta v. Aycock, 205 Ga. 441, 53 S.E.2d 744 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The fact that two defendants are large stockholders in a company seeking to consolidate their cases does not give them such a common interest in the result of the litigation against the corporation as would authorize the consolidation of suits against each of them as individuals with suits against the corporation. Walker Elec. Co. v. Walton, 201 Ga. 591, 40 S.E.2d 523 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Petition seeking cancellation of a security deed and injunction against a sale under power contained therein, alleging that the debt which the deed was given to secure had been paid, brought by the administratrix of the estate of the grantor in the deed, a holder of a lien junior to the security deed, the owner of a one-half undivided interest in the lands therein conveyed, of whose interest the defendant grantee had notice at the time the deed was executed, was sufficient to set forth a cause of action for the relief prayed for as against a general demurrer (now subject to motion to dismiss), and was not demurrable (now motion to dismiss) on the ground of multifariousness, or of misjoinder of parties plaintiff, or that the interests of the plaintiffs were antagonistic and divergent as all the plaintiffs had an interest in the realty, and a common interest in seeking to enjoin a sale thereof and cancellation of the deed thereto. Perry v. Gormley, 183 Ga. 757, 189 S.E. 850 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There is no misjoinder of causes of action or of parties plaintiff, and the petition is not multifarious, where the property rights of all the petitioners are affected by the defendants' attempt to condemn the plaintiff's property and by the acts of the defendants, who are alleged to be proceeding under a void Act of the General Assembly, and an unconstitutional, illegal, and void ordinance enacted by the defendant city pursuant to the powers purported to be conferred by the Act.

<p class="p4">In view of the interest and general authority of a city to protect its streets and keep them free of obstructions, where separate acts of the railroad company and of the city have the effect to destroy an existing street as a continuous way, the railroad company and the city can be joined in one action for mandamus to compel each to remove the obstructions made by it. Such an action does not show a joinder of separate and distinct claims against different parties. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v.

<p class="p4">Order of court consolidating suit by heirs at law, and suit by creditors, was not erroneous merely because of differences in the parties and in the relief sought, there being at least one matter common to both suits, in which all of the parties to each suit asserted interest, and a common relation of all contentions to the same estate.

<p class="p4"><b>Equitable jurisdiction requires common issue.</b> - Before equity will assume jurisdiction to enjoin the bringing of multiple suits, the same issue must be involved in each of the suits.

<p class="p10"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pleading and Practice</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The general test, in determining whether cases can be consolidated</b> or whether an equity suit will lie to enjoin an action at law and try its issues in the equity suit, is whether the two suits could have been joined in one petition; and this depends on whether a misjoinder or multifariousness would result. Sanders v. Wilson, 193 Ga. 393, 18 S.E.2d 765 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A petition is multifarious when it embraces two or more claims by separate and distinct parties against separate and distinct parties, and where there is no common right to be established. Saliba v. Saliba, 202 Ga. 279, 42 S.E.2d 748 (1947); Burgin Lumber Co. v. Kirksey, 203 Ga. 439, 47 S.E.2d 68 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where a petition should have been dismissed in the lower court for improper joinder and for multifariousness, the appellate court will not rule upon the merits of the several claims set forth in the petition, because it would be possible for a plaintiff to include in one action a multitude of disconnected claims against as many separate persons, and thus procure a decision upon the merits of each, and in effect avoid the rule against joining in one action separate claims against separate persons. Burgin Lumber Co. v. Kirksey, 203 Ga. 439, 47 S.E.2d 68 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though under this section equity might reach out and bring in as parties persons not already joined, it will not do so if a misjoinder or multifariousness would result. Such would be the result if separate claims with different issues would have to be determined. Sanders v. Wilson, 193 Ga. 393, 18 S.E.2d 765 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where there are two actions at law, brought by separate plaintiffs, to recover damages ex delicto, in which neither party has a joint interest with the other, and a person who is a defendant in both actions at law seeks to convert one of them into an equitable suit on the sole ground of avoiding multiplicity, the rules against multifariousness are more strictly applied to deny the joinder. Sanders v. Wilson, 193 Ga. 393, 18 S.E.2d 765 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">After an ancillary petition seeking possession of property is filed, the court may, on application in a proper case, cause other parties to be made, where they are asserting some rights affecting the property and while a claimant in possession may not be subject to summary dispossession by the sheriff under the warrant sued out, the court of equity has authority, under its broad powers, to make the claimant a party in order to settle the rights of all parties in one action, without remitting the petitioner in the ancillary proceeding to a common-law action of ejectment.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Decree should conform to the law.</b> - When there is an error of law apparent on the face of the auditor's report, wholly irrespective of the evidence on which it is based, the judge in framing his decree should correct any error of law apparent on the face of the report, and make his decree conform to the law.

<p class="p4"><b>A decree must follow the verdict upon which it is founded;</b> but this principle does not require that no decree be rendered unless the verdict contains all the facts upon which it is founded. A decree should follow the finding of facts found by a special verdict; but, while the judge in rendering the decree cannot go contrary to the facts found in a special verdict, he may examine the pleadings, admissions made by the parties, and all undisputed facts. In the absence of anything to the contrary, it will be presumed that the judge was authorized by the pleadings, admissions made by the parties, or by the undisputed evidence, to enter the decree which he rendered.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Decree may be molded to meet exigencies of the case, etc.</b> - After a jury returns a general verdict finding a nuisance exists, the trial court is authorized under this section to mold its decree so as to meet the exigencies of the case and the prayers of the plaintiffs. Tufts v. DuBignon, 61 Ga. 322 (1878); Parnell v. Wooten, 202 Ga. 443, 43 S.E.2d 673 (1947); City of Cordele v. Hobby, 240 Ga. 207, 240 S.E.2d 16 (1977); Cotts v.

<p class="p4">Trial court was entitled to enter an order molding the verdict in continuing a nuisance case pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-4-31, as doing so was necessary to meet the exigencies of the case and the prayers of the landowners, and the order entered three months after judgment did not modify the judgment in any matter of substance not contemplated by the parties at the time the judgment was entered. City of Columbus v. Barngrover, 250 Ga. App. 589, 552 S.E.2d 536 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enforcement order proper.</b> - Trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in balancing the equities and entering a second order requiring conveyance of property in exchange for payment of the sum determined in its original order, plus interest, and refusing to order either party to reimburse the other for taxes, maintenance, or rental value related to the property. Nowlin v. Davis, 278 Ga. 240, 599 S.E.2d 128 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Enforcement of divorce decree not an impermissible modification.</b> - Trial court's order requiring a husband to return to the wife items of jewelry which were not mentioned in the original decree was not an impermissible modification of the decree but an enforcement of a settlement agreement reached between the parties themselves, as permitted by the decree, which the court could enforce under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-4-31. Doritis v. Doritis, 294 Ga. 421, 754 S.E.2d 53 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Manner of enforcement of decree is within discretion of judge.</b> - In molding a decree upon the jury's verdict upon the facts, the chancellor (now judge) has a very broad discretion in determining what steps shall be taken to secure the enforcement of the rights awarded by the verdict, to the end that equity may afford adequate and complete relief, and this discretion will not in any case be controlled unless it is manifest there has been an abuse of discretion in a material matter. Bank of Tupelo v. Collier, 191 Ga. 852, 14 S.E.2d 59 (1941); Bregman v. Rosenthal, 212 Ga. 95, 90 S.E.2d 561 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An order entered by the trial court after appeal was not an impermissible modification of a final judgment, where the second decree became necessary only because the owner refused to obey the first decree.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Out-of-term modification of order not permitted.</b> - Where the trial court's order is final in that the case is no longer pending in the trial court, the trial court lacks authority, in a succeeding term, to modify that order so as to relieve parties from their duty of compliance. Cobb County v. Buchanan, 261 Ga. 854, 413 S.E.2d 198 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creation of trust for child support effectuated jury's intent.</b> - Where, in a divorce case, the jury clearly intended to create a trust for the purpose of providing support for the minor child during his minority and they also intended that there be monthly payments from the trust for the use of the child, but the husband failed to take any substantive steps to set up the trust, there was no error in the trial court naming a trustee and providing the necessary provisions to effectuate the trust for the purpose of providing monthly child support, such as requiring the husband to make the payments necessary to keep current on his obligations for his share of the debts, encumbrances and maintenance of the trust property.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of decree affecting out-of-state property generally.</b> - Petition charging that defendant husband was seeking to place his property where it could not be reached by his wife (his judgment creditor) presented a situation where upon proof a court of equity could grant prayers for setting aside alleged fraudulent conveyance and transfer to out-of-state resident, as well as alleged fraudulent claims of lien for attorneys' fees, and for appointment of a receiver to take charge of defendant's assets and under the direction of the court sell enough to pay the petitioner the amount now due under her two judgments.

<p class="p4">Petition brought against a judgment debtor and other defendants, alleging that they entered into a conspiracy in bad faith to hinder, delay, or defraud the petitioner in the collection of her two judgments, and that in pursuance of such conspiracy various properties of the judgment debtor were secreted and fraudulent conveyances were made, with the result that the property of the judgment debtor in this state not so concealed or conveyed was insufficient to discharge the amount due under the two judgments, and seeking to set aside such fraudulent conveyances and the appointment of a receiver and other relief, stated a cause of action against the four defendants.

<p class="p4">When a case is a proper one in other respects for equitable relief independent of statute, an obligation can be enforced wherever defendant is personally within the jurisdiction of the court, although land lying in another state may be affected by the decree and in such cases the court does not act upon the land, or make any order in reference to it; it simply declares a certain transaction relating to the land fraudulent, as between the complainant and the offending parties, and thus removes it as an obstruction to the creditor's legal remedy.

Williams v. Mobley, 38 Ga. 241 (1868).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Interlocutory judgment conflicting with prior order.</b> - Where the court enjoins the defendant from disposing of property except by the approval of court, at an interlocutory hearing to secure the appointment of a receiver and to impress a trust on said property, it is error under this section for the court by a subsequent interlocutory judgment to order the defendant to deliver the property to plaintiff before an adjudication of the issue of the ownership of the property.

Because the allegations of the petition, as amended, if true, made a case entitling them to injunction, and whether an interlocutory injunction should or should not have been granted by the trial judge under the facts presented, the plaintiffs still had a right to have a hearing before a jury with a view of determining whether or not a permanent injunction should be granted.

<p class="p4"><b>Judge vested with discretion as to confirmation of sales.</b> - The discretion of the judge is a sound legal discretion and he cannot arbitrarily withhold his confirmation of a sale made under decree of the court.

<p class="p4"><b>Abuse of discretion generally.</b> - Where, in a suit to enjoin an exercise of a power of sale contained in a security deed, the sale was allowed to proceed subject to confirmation by the court, and on the question of confirmation, subsequently arising, the existence of the facts alleged as grounds of objection was the sole issue presented, and such issue was a matter of dispute under the evidence, the judge did not abuse his discretion in decreeing confirmation.
