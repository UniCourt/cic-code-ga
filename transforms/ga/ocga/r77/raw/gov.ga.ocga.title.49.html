<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide for programs for home delivered meals, transportation services for the elderly, and preschool children with special needs, including but not limited to disabled children, troubled children, school readiness programs, and other similar needs for the benefit of the citizens of Georgia. In addition to and as a supplement to traditional financing mechanisms for such programs, it is the policy of this state to enable and encourage citizens voluntarily to support such programs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To support programs for home delivered meals, transportation services for the elderly, and preschool children with special needs which programs have been established or approved by the department or the Department of Community Health, the department may, without limitation, promote and solicit voluntary contributions through the income tax return contribution mechanism established in subsection (f) of this Code section, through offers to match contributions by any person with moneys appropriated or contributed to the department or the Department of Community Health for such programs, or through any fund raising or other promotional techniques deemed appropriate by the department or the Department of Community Health. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is established a special fund to be known as the "Home Delivered Meals, Transportation Services for the Elderly, and Preschool Children with Special Needs Fund." This fund shall consist of all moneys contributed under subsection (b) of this Code section, all moneys transferred to the department under subsection (f) of this Code section, and any other moneys contributed to this fund or to the home delivered meals, transportation services for the elderly, or preschool children with special needs programs of the department or the Department of Community Health and all interest thereon. All balances in the fund shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account identifying the fund and shall be carried forward each year so that no part thereof may be deposited in the general treasury. The fund shall be administered and the moneys held in the fund shall be expended by the department through the Division of Aging Services in furtherance of home delivered meals and transportation services to the elderly programs and by the Department of Community Health in furtherance of preschool children with special needs programs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following the transmittal of contributions to the department for deposit in the fund pursuant to subsection (f) of this Code section, the expenditure of moneys in the fund shall be allocated as follows: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) Fifty percent of the contributions to the fund shall be used for home delivered meals and transportation services to the elderly programs; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) Fifty percent of the contributions to the fund shall be transferred to the Department of Community Health to be used for preschool children with special needs programs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contributions to the fund shall be deemed supplemental to and shall in no way supplant funding that would otherwise be appropriated for these purposes. Contributions shall only be used for benefits and services and shall not be used for personnel or administrative positions. The department and the Department of Community Health shall each prepare, by February 1 of each year, an accounting of the funds received and expended from the fund and a review and evaluation of all expended moneys of the fund. The reports shall be made available to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to the members of the Board of Human Services, and, upon request, to members of the public. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(f) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless an earlier date is deemed feasible and established by the Governor, each Georgia income tax return form for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1993, shall contain appropriate language, to be determined by the state revenue commissioner, offering the taxpayer the opportunity to contribute to the Home Delivered Meals, Transportation Services for the Elderly, and Preschool Children with Special Needs Fund established in subsection (c) of this Code section by either donating all or any part of any tax refund due, by authorizing a reduction in the refund check otherwise payable, or by contributing any amount over and above any amount of tax owed by adding that amount to the taxpayer's payment. The instructions accompanying the income tax return form shall contain a description of the purposes for which this fund was established and the intended use of moneys received from the contributions. Each taxpayer required to file a state income tax return who desires to contribute to such fund may designate such contribution as provided in this Code section on the appropriate income tax return form. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) The Department of Revenue shall determine annually the total amount so contributed, shall withhold therefrom a reasonable amount for administering this voluntary contribution program, and shall transmit the balance to the department for deposit in the fund established in subsection (c) of this Code section; provided, however, that the amount retained for administrative costs, including implementation costs, shall not exceed $50,000.00 per year. If, in any tax year, the administrative costs of the Department of Revenue for collecting contributions pursuant to this Code section exceed the sum of such contributions, the administrative costs which the Department of Revenue is authorized to withhold from such contributions shall not exceed the sum of such contributions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - This section is not unconstitutionally vague in that the statute makes it a crime to receive public assistance to which a person is "not entitled" without defining "entitlement" or referring to statutes, rules, or regulations pursuant to which entitlement is determined.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction of "may" in waiver clause.</b> - Word "may" in this section's waiver clause affects the rights of needy dependent children to receive financial assistance under the Georgia Aid to Families with Dependent Children; therefore, it is clear that the word "may" must be construed as mandatory rather than permissive.

<p class="p4"><b>Guilty plea not bar to prosecution for subsequent fraud.</b> - Defendant's plea of guilty to fraudulently obtaining $3,796 in public assistance payments between March 1985 and March 1986, would not bar the state from prosecuting defendant for the subsequent fraudulent obtaining of $1,585 in public assistance payments between August 1987 and January 1988.

<p class="p8">The department may examine any books, papers, or memoranda reflecting the income of, or financial records bearing upon the determination of the eligibility of, recipients in instances of alleged fraud by recipients of food stamps and public assistance. This process may be implemented by means of a subpoena which may be issued by the commissioner of human services, upon the advice of the State Department of Law. In order to consider the issuance of such subpoenas, the director of the department's office of fraud and abuse must personally make application in writing to the commissioner of human services specifying why such information is necessary. If issued, such subpoenas shall compel the production of relevant documents. Subpoenas shall be served in the same manner as if issued by a superior court. If any person fails to obey a subpoena issued and served under this Code section with respect to any matter germane to the department's investigation, on application of the department, through the commissioner of human services or the commissioner's duly authorized representative, the superior court of the county in which the documents were required to be produced may issue an order requiring the person to comply with the subpoena and to produce the relevant documents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The department is authorized to establish the amount, duration, scope, and terms and conditions of eligibility for and receipt of such medical assistance as it may elect to authorize pursuant to this article. Further, the department is authorized to establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary or desirable in order to execute the state plan and to receive the maximum amount of federal financial participation available in expenditures made pursuant to the state plan; provided, however, that the department shall establish reasonable procedures for notice to interested parties and an opportunity to be heard prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any such rule or regulation. The department is authorized to enter into such reciprocal and cooperative arrangements with other states, persons, and institutions, public and private, as it may deem necessary or desirable in order to execute the state plan. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The modification to the plan or to any affected rules and regulations shall be effective unless and until federal authorities rule that such modification is out of compliance with federal regulations. Such modification of the state plan for medical assistance or rules and regulations: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) Shall provide that a provider of nursing home services in either a skilled care facility or an intermediate care facility shall be obligated to provide a recipient of medical assistance only semiprivate accommodations which meet the other requirements of appropriate regulations; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) Shall provide that at no time can more than 10 percent of a skilled care or intermediate care facility's rooms be used for Medicaid recipients for whom a private room supplementation has been made; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) Shall provide that payments made by relatives or other persons to a provider of medical assistance for the specific stated purpose of paying the additional costs for a private room or private sitter or both for a recipient of medical assistance in a skilled care facility or intermediate care facility shall not be considered as income when determining the amount of patient liability toward vendor payments; provided, however, that the department's entitlement to payments made by legally liable third parties shall not be diminished by this modification of the state plan; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) Shall provide that no provider of medical assistance shall discriminate against a recipient of medical assistance who does not have a relative or other person who is willing and able to provide supplementation; but the provision of a private room or private sitter to a recipient when supplementation is provided shall not constitute discrimination against other recipients; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(5) Shall provide that no recipient who is transferred to or admitted to a private room because of a shortage of beds in semiprivate rooms shall be discharged because the recipient does not have a relative or other person who is willing and able to provide supplementation; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(6) May provide that the rate charged by the provider of medical assistance to the relative or other person providing supplementation for a private room for a recipient shall not exceed the difference between the maximum rate charged by the provider for a private room to or for a private pay patient and the amount which the provider receives or will receive from the department as reimbursement for otherwise providing for the recipient's care in a semiprivate room. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exhaustion of administrative remedies required.</b> - In an action involving a dispute over Medicaid reimbursement rates, the plaintiffs were not excused from the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement because the plaintiffs were required to raise the plaintiffs' defective notice claims in the administrative review process in the first instance and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-4-153 governed that administrative review process.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>State's rules restricting reimbursement for abortions inconsistent with Social Security Act.</b> - Rules promulgated by Georgia's Department of Medical Assistance (now Department of Community Health) restricting reimbursement to Medicaid enrollees for medically necessary abortions are inconsistent with Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 1396 et seq., and because the plaintiff classes will suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate legal remedy, the defendants, the defendants' agents and employees, must be permanently enjoined from refusing to provide Medicaid reimbursement to the members of the plaintiff classes for the provision of all medically necessary abortions. Doe v. Busbee, 481 F. Supp. 46 (N.D. Ga. 1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restrictive rules amounting to denial or reduction of required service.</b> - Restrictions on reimbursement for abortions contained in Georgia's rules amount to a denial or reduction of a required service to an otherwise eligible recipient solely because of that eligible recipient's condition, i.e., pregnancy, and furthermore, these restrictions are not based on medical necessity or utilization control procedures nor is any contention made by the defendants that the abortions sought by the plaintiffs were not medically necessary or presented utilization control problems; therefore, under 42 C.F.R. <span class="s1">§</span> 440.230(c), the Georgia Department of Medical Assistance (now Department of Community Health) must provide reimbursement for these medically necessary abortions.

<p class="p4"><b>Plan administrator.</b> - In O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-4-142(a), the General Assembly has designated the Georgia Department of Community Health as the agency authorized to adopt and administer the plan for medical assistance under the federal Medicaid program.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Minimum requirements that state's Medicaid plan must meet.</b> - As a participating state, Georgia's Medicaid plan must meet certain minimum requirements as set out in Title XIX of the Social Security Act. The following categories of services must be provided: (1) inpatient hospital services; (2) outpatient hospital services; (3) laboratory and x-ray services; (4)(A) skilled nursing facility services; (B) early and periodic screening and diagnosis for persons under 21 years of age; (C) family planning services and supplies; and (5) physicians' services, (whether furnished in the office, patient's home, a hospital, skilled nursing facility or elsewhere).

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of renunciation of inheritance on Medicaid benefits.</b> - While a Medicaid claimant was entitled under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 53-1-20 to renounce an inheritance under the will of the claimant's spouse, this did not insulate that choice from the application of Medicaid's eligibility regulations. Thus, the Georgia Department of Community Health properly denied Medicaid vendor benefits to the claimant. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Medders, 292 Ga.

<p class="p4">"WHEREAS, expanding Medicaid eligibility by increasing the income threshold for the Medicaid entitlement program would dramatically increase the number of Georgians receiving public assistance that otherwise do not qualify for Medicaid benefits by meeting low income program requirements for aged, blind, and disabled individuals; for families or children age 18 and under; for aged, blind, and disabled individuals receiving nursing home care; for individuals receiving hospice care; for pregnant women; or for individuals with breast or cervical cancer; or by meeting other program requirements for children in foster care or adopted from foster care or for children with disabilities receiving services under a federal Deeming waiver; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"WHEREAS, in support of Governor Deal's stance against this effort to oblige states to expand the income threshold for Medicaid benefits and, in an effort to assure any similar efforts by the federal government are seriously evaluated in the future, the General Assembly determines it is essential that a potential expansion of eligibility for Medicaid be thoroughly debated and voted upon by the legislature." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Thereupon, the clerk shall immediately enter upon his record of docketed judgments the name of the person so indebted, that the debt is owed to the state, a designation of the statute under which such amount is found to be due, the amount due, and the date of the certification.

<p class="p4"><b>Indictment defective for failing to list specific dates.</b> - Trial court erred in overruling the defendant's special demurrer with regard to portions of the indictment that contended that the Medicaid fraud and theft by taking crimes were committed over a range of 38 months because the specific dates were known to the state and the indictment should have listed those dates due to the number of alleged acts.

The Department of Community Health shall, within 15 business days of receiving the request for hearing from the provider, transmit a copy of the provider's request for hearing to the Office of State Administrative Hearings. The provider's request for hearing shall identify the issues under appeal and specify the relief requested by the provider.

The final determination (subject to judicial review, if any) of such an entity denying issuance of such a form of permission shall be binding on and unreviewable by the Department of Community Health. In cases where an entitlement to a hearing before the Department of Community Health, pursuant to this paragraph, lies, the Department of Community Health shall give written notice of either the denial of enrollment or termination from enrollment to the affected person or institution; and such notice shall include the reasons of the Department of Community Health for denial or termination. Should such a person or institution desire to contest the initial decision of the Department of Community Health, he or she must give written notice of his or her appeal to the commissioner of community health within ten days after the date on which the notice of denial or notice of termination was transmitted to him or her. A hearing shall be scheduled and commenced within 20 days after the date on which the commissioner receives the notice of appeal; and the commissioner or his or her designee or designees shall render a final administrative decision as soon as practicable thereafter. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The petition may be filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county of residence of the petitioner. When the petitioner is a corporation, the action may be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county where the petitioner maintains its principal place of doing business in this state. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the commissioner and all parties of record. The petition shall state the nature of the petitioner's interest, the facts showing that the petitioner is aggrieved by the decision, and any grounds upon which the petitioner contends that the decision should be reversed or modified. Judicial review of the commissioner's decision may be obtained in the same manner and under the same standards as are applicable to those contested cases which are reviewable pursuant to Code Section 50-13-19; provided, however, that no other provision of Chapter 13 of Title 50 shall be applicable to the department with the exception of Code Sections 50-13-13 and 50-13-15. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a stay of the commissioner's final decision may be granted by a reviewing court to a provider of medical assistance only on condition that such provider posts bond with the commissioner in favor of the state, with good and sufficient surety thereon by a surety company licensed to do business in this state, in an amount determined by the commissioner to be sufficient to recompense the state for all medical assistance which otherwise would not be paid to the provider but for the granting of such a stay.

The Department of Community Health shall, within 15 business days of receiving the request for hearing from the provider, transmit a copy of the provider's request for hearing to the Office of State Administrative Hearings but shall not be a party to the proceedings. The provider's request for hearing shall identify the care management organization with which the provider has a dispute, the issues under appeal, and specify the relief requested by the provider. The request for hearing shall be filed no later than 15 business days after the provider of medical assistance receives the decision of the care management organization which is the basis for the appeal. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an administrative law judge appointed pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be authorized to allow a provider of medical assistance to consolidate pending complaints or claims against a care management organization that are based on the same or similar payment or coverage issues, as determined by such administrative law judge. Such consolidation shall include disposition of the same or similar claims through a single hearing that adjudicates the total amount of such consolidated claims. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to a civil action under this Code section.

Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. The remaining proceeds shall be payable to the State of Georgia, by and through the Department of Community Health, for the purposes of operating, sustaining, protecting, and administering the Georgia Medicaid program.

The remaining proceeds shall be payable to the State of Georgia, by and through the Department of Community Health, for the purposes of operating, sustaining, protecting, and administering the Georgia Medicaid program.

If the person bringing the civil action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of Code Section 49-4-168.1, such person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the civil action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the State of Georgia to continue the civil action, represented by the Attorney General. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) If the Attorney General does not proceed with the civil action and the person bringing the civil action conducts the civil action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the person bringing the civil action if the defendant prevails in the civil action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the civil action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p7"><b>49-4-169. Legislative findings and intent.<br>
</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">The General Assembly finds that changes in the approval process of certain health care programs have made it difficult for children with disabilities who are eligible for medical assistance pursuant to Article 7 of this chapter to receive the services to which they are entitled with the frequency and within the time periods which are appropriate. Separate administration of the categorically needy and the medically fragile programs should not result in any variation in the amount, duration, and scope of services. Redundant paperwork requirements have hampered service approvals and delivery and reduced the number of providers serving children. It is the intent of this article to ensure that children with disabilities receive the medically necessary therapy services to which they are entitled under the Medicaid Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Program and that categorically needy and medically fragile children have available to them the same scope, duration, and amount of services. It is also the intent of this article to simplify the process and paperwork by which occupational, speech, and physical therapy services are applied for and received by eligible recipients.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p5">PURPOSE. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p8">The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">(A) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(B) Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(C) Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(D) Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(E) Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(F) Equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(G) Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(H) Insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(I) Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(J) Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(K) Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(L) Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(M) Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>"Legal custody."</b> - Visitation rights of a parent of a child in the custody of the Department of Family and Children Services are a residual "parental tie" which is not severed by the mere placement of the child in the temporary custody of the department without a specific finding as to that right. In re K.B., 188 Ga. App. 199, 372 S.E.2d 476 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Once temporary legal custody of a child was placed in the department under a shelter care order, the sole right to determine where and with whom the child would live vested with the department; the direction of the trial court to remove the child from the father's home was not binding, and the trial court's later contempt finding based on this order was improper. In re Tidwell, 279 Ga. App. 734, 632 S.E.2d 690 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impact of 2003 amendment to O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 15-11-55.</b> - Juvenile court erred in awarding legal custody of two children to the Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS) and then ordering that physical custody be given to the maternal grandparents as: (1) once legal custody of a deprived child has been granted to DFACS, the juvenile court cannot dictate physical custody; (2) nothing in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-55(a)(2) allowed any redefinition of legal custody as defined in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-3(12); (3) using the rules of construction, <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-55(a)(2) followed the statutory and legal precedent that the grant of legal custody to DFACS included the right to determine physical custody; and (4) the 2003 amendment to <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-55 did not reject the statutory definition of legal custody. In the Interest of A.N., 281 Ga. 58, 636 S.E.2d 496 (2006). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Nothing in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-55(a)(2) allows any redefinition of legal custody as defined in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-3(12). Instead, <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-55(a)(2) follows the statutory and legal precedent that the grant of legal custody to the Department of Family and Children Services includes the right to determine physical custody; the 2003 amendment to <span class="s1">§</span> 15-11-55 does not reject the statutory definition of legal custody.

<p class="p4"><b>Joint legal and physical custody.</b> - Juvenile court exceeded the court's authority when the court awarded joint legal and physical custody of a deprived child jointly with the Department of Human Resources (DHR) and unrelated third parties when the DHR objected to such arrangement. In re J.N.T., 212 Ga. App. 498, 441 S.E.2d 918 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Authority to determine physical placement of children.</b> - Trial court erred in ordering the Department of Family and Children's Services (DFACS) to remove a foster child from the care of the child's foster parent because the order improperly infringed upon the authority of DFACS to determine the physical placement of children within the department's custody; DFACS had legal custody of the child since the child was born, and DFACS, as legal custodian, stood in loco parentis and had all legal rights of a natural parent, including the benefit of a prima facie right to custody.

<p class="p4"><b>Payment of travel expenses authorized.</b> - Inasmuch as the creation of an advisory council was within the scope of Ga. L. 1937, p. 355 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 49-2-1, 49-2-7), it follows that the payment of the out-of-pocket travel expenses to enable the council to function efficiently and thus assist in the accomplishment of the department's express statutory duties as set forth in Ga.

L. 1972, p. 582, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-5-51) which provides that the commissioner of corrections and not the sentencing court designates the place of confinement of any individual within the court's jurisdiction. 1972 Op.

A notable exception to this general provision provides that the Division for Children and Youth (now Department of Children and Youth Services) is designated the exclusive state agency for the acceptance and incarceration of all misdemeanants and felons under the age of 17 years; provided, however, that those felons convicted of a capital felony shall only be sentenced into the custody of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (now Department of Corrections). 1972 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Foster children.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 15-11-13, 15-11-58, 20-2-690.1 and 49-5-12 set out in clear detail the rights and services to which foster children are entitled. As a result, the federal statutory provisions in question are not too vague and amorphous to be enforced by the judiciary and each of the state statutes at issue impose specific duties on the state defendants. Thus, the federal regulatory scheme embodied in the Child and Family Services Review process does not relieve the state defendants of the defendants' obligation to fulfill the defendants' statutory duties to plaintiff foster children, nor does the regulatory scheme provide a legal excuse for the defendants' failure to do so.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Action for deprivation of civil rights.</b> - Georgia statutory foster care scheme created in a two-year-old child a legitimate and sufficiently vested claim of entitlement such that deprivation of that entitlement without due process of law imposed on the child a grievous loss, supporting the child's action for injuries under the federal Civil Rights Act. Taylor ex rel. Walker v. Ledbetter, 818 F.2d 791 (11th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1065, 109 S. Ct. 1337, 103 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Private cause of action.</b> - Following factors are relevant in determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one: first, whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted; second, whether there is any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one; third, whether it is consistent with the underlying purpose of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for plaintiff. When foster children alleged that certain child services agencies and officials violated O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-12(j), that subsection conferred upon the children a private cause of action.

<p class="p4"><b>Discovery of "scientific records."</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-7-211 did not provide an independent statutory basis for discovery of "scientific records" of child abuse maintained by institutions listed in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the absence of obtaining a statutory exception by compliance with O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-41 or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-41.1, as applicable, such child abuse records remain protected.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to provide county child abuse records.</b> - Trial court erred by failing to provide the defendant with the county child abuse documents the defendant requested during the defendant's trial for child molestation, but the defendant was not denied due process since the defendant failed to show that the trial court withheld any material, exculpatory information. Dodd v. State, 293 Ga. App. 816, 668 S.E.2d 311 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Oral allegation of child abuse to Department of Family and Children Services was publication for purposes of slander claim.</b> - Although under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-40(b), reports made to the Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS) are confidential, the law of defamation requires only that the statement be disseminated to any person other than the person slandered.

<p class="p4"><b>Criminal defendant not entitled to MySpace.com and school records.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant access to the incest victim's MySpace.com and school records because the defendant failed to show both the materiality and the favorable nature of the evidence sought. Stephens v. State, 305 Ga. App. 339, 699 S.E.2d 558 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Burden on defendant to show need for release of records.</b> - Trial court did not err by failing to release documents showing earlier child abuse from a child's file which might have been critical to a defendant's case since the burden was on the defendant to show what documents in a child's sealed file were suppressed and how it was materially exculpatory and the defendant failed to make the showing.

<p class="p4"><b>If the juvenile court considers it necessary for resolution of an issue</b> before the court, the court may order disclosure of information. Ray v. Department of Human Resources, 155 Ga. App. 81, 270 S.E.2d 303 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Procedure for obtaining records for child abuse investigation.</b> - When the defendant assigned error to the trial court's failure to direct the Department of Human Resources to disclose any and all reports used by or prepared by the department in investigating an allegation of child abuse, since the records sought by defendant were confidential and access thereto was prohibited except as provided by O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 5, T. 49, the proper procedure for obtaining access was to petition the trial court to subpoena the records and conduct an in camera inspection as to whether the records were necessary for determination of an issue before the court and were otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence. Defendant's general Brady motion was inadequate to have properly raised this issue in the court below, and the assertion of error in this regard was meritless. Davidson v. State, 183 Ga. App. 557, 359 S.E.2d 372, cert. denied, 183 Ga. App. 905, 359 S.E.2d 372 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Criminal defendant not entitled to records.</b> - In a prosecution for aggravated child molestation and related crimes, the trial court did not err in denying the defense request for the notes and work product of the social workers who testified at trial concerning the social workers' contact with the children involved. Moss v. State, 216 Ga. App. 711, 455 S.E.2d 411 (1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a prosecution for child molestation, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's request for a complete copy of files from the Department of Family and Children Services. Honeycutt v. State, 245 Ga. App. 819, 538 S.E.2d 870 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Given the fact that the defendant failed to request an in camera inspection of confidential records and files pertaining to allegations of sexual abuse allegedly committed by the defendant until appellate counsel did so in the second amended motion for new trial, the state was not obligated to produce the information and did not violate the defendant's due process rights under Brady or Georgia's reciprocal discovery act by not providing the file earlier. Moreover, some of the information was known to the defendant, and no showing that the information could have been obtained with due diligence was made. Ellis v. State, 289 Ga. App. 452, 657 S.E.2d 562 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a child molestation conviction, after the defendant determined during trial that the state had not informed the defendant of an additional interview conducted by the victim's counselor, the state did not violate the Georgia Reciprocal Discovery Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 17-16-4(a)(3)(a), by failing to provide this material because the defendant had not requested an in camera inspection of the confidential therapist's records as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-41. Waters v. State, 303 Ga. App. 187, 692 S.E.2d 802 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant not entitled to MySpace.com records.</b> - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant access to the incest victim's MySpace.com and school records because the defendant failed to show both the materiality and the favorable nature of the evidence sought. Stephens v. State, 305 Ga. App. 339, 699 S.E.2d 558 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in failing to forward to the defendant the court's confidential file documents regarding two child molestation victims because the trial court's finding that the files contained no exculpatory evidence was alone sufficient, and the defendant made no showing that the material was exculpatory; a defendant who challenges a trial court's in camera inspection on appeal must show what information was suppressed and how that information was materially exculpatory. Tidwell v. State, 306 Ga. App. 307, 701 S.E.2d 920 (2010), overruled on other grounds, White v. State, 305 Ga. 111,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>823 S.E.2d 794, 2019 Ga. LEXIS 66 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Criminal defendant should have received county child abuse documents.</b> - Trial court erred by failing to provide the defendant with the county child abuse documents the defendant requested during the defendant's trial for child molestation, but the defendant was not denied due process since the defendant failed to show that the trial court withheld any material, exculpatory information. Dodd v. State, 293 Ga. App. 816, 668 S.E.2d 311 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden on defendant to show need for release of records.</b> - Trial court did not err by failing to release documents showing earlier child abuse from a child's file which might have been critical to a defendant's case since the burden was on the defendant to show what documents in a child's sealed file were suppressed and how those documents were materially exculpatory and the defendant failed to make the showing. Dunagan v. State, 255 Ga. App. 309, 565 S.E.2d 526 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Trial court may not delegate duty of reviewing records.</b> - When a trial court subpoenas the records of the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS) under the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-41 upon the court's finding that access to such records may be necessary, the court is required to undertake review of the records for potentially exculpatory material, and there is no statutory discretion enabling the trial court to relegate this duty to others because of their status as officers of the court; thus, after the trial court had subpoenaed the DFACS records under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-41 in the defendant's case, the trial court erred in failing to review the records in camera for exculpatory evidence and in having the prosecution undertake that review, but the error was harmless since the defendant acquiesced in the trial court's improper decision to delegate the court's duty of reviewing the records to the prosecution. Pollard v. State, 260 Ga. App. 540, 580 S.E.2d 337 (2003), overruled on other grounds by State v. Lane, 2020 Ga. LEXIS 98 (Ga. 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Court's failure to provide access to records.</b> - Although the trial court considered the records of the Department of Family and Children Services in reaching the court's verdict, the court erred in declining to provide access to the records, erroneously believing that the parties had to request that the records be admitted into evidence or be included in the record.

<p class="p8">As an alternative to the requirements set out in this article pertaining to obtaining preliminary criminal records check determinations through the department for employees, foster parents, and adults residing in a foster care home, but not including directors of centers, centers may obtain GCIC information through local law enforcement agencies. The center shall be responsible for reviewing the GCIC information obtained for the potential employee, or foster parent or other adult residing in the foster care home, and making a written determination that the individual does not have a criminal record as defined in this article. This written determination, together with all supporting documentation received from any law enforcement agency, must be maintained in the center's file and available for inspection by the department. This satisfactory determination must be made before the employee or foster parent begins any duties for the center. However, where there is an urgent need for an emergency temporary employee to work at a center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing requirements, such center may utilize the applicant as an emergency temporary employee after applying for the preliminary records check through the local law enforcement agency and completing the affidavit. In such emergency situations, the director of the center must complete an affidavit, with all supporting documentation attached thereto, stating that the GCIC information has been requested through an identified local law enforcement agency and that the results were not immediately available to the center prior to assigning the employee to work with children at the center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing ratios. The affidavit with supporting documentation must be maintained in the center's file on the individual and available to the department for inspection. The director shall review the GCIC information upon receipt, but in no case shall an emergency temporary employee be permitted to continue working for more than three days without having a satisfactory determination made by the director and entered into the center's file on the employee with all supporting documentation. The department shall promulgate rules and regulations limiting the extent to which centers are authorized to use emergency temporary employees in accordance with this Code section. Foster parents and adults residing in a foster care home utilized by child-placing agencies shall never be utilized as emergency temporary employees of the child-placing agency. Employees, emergency temporary employees, foster parents, and other adults required to have records checks who are utilized by centers are subject to all other requirements set forth in this article. Where the department has reason to question the validity of the GCIC information or the satisfactory determination made by the center, the department may require the employee, emergency temporary employee, foster parent, or other adult to submit a preliminary criminal records check application through the department together with appropriate fees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Additionally, it is the intent of this part to provide for noninstitutional disposition options in any case before the juvenile court where such disposition is deemed to be in the best interest of the child and of the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This Code section shall be known and may be cited as the "Georgia Mentoring Act of 2000." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly finds that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) Every child in this state is encouraged to have a caring adult who, along with parents and teachers, is able to offer support, friendship, encouragement, and motivation to help the child excel academically and lead a productive life; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) As a society, we look to a child's family to provide a supportive home environment and realize that the primary responsibility for child rearing must remain with the family. However, we are keenly aware of increases in child abuse and neglect, the escalation of drug and alcohol abuse, and that many children who could excel in school are not receiving all the help and support they need to succeed; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) Untapped human resources exist in local communities throughout the state that can provide many children with an additional caring, positive academic role model or mentor. These individuals will help those children progress in school and help direct and reinforce the many opportunities that will further enhance each child's life; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) The members of the private sector throughout this state should be commended for their generous financial support of public schools. Now there is another significant contribution they can and must make to Georgia's children and youth: the investment of human capital in our children's future as academic volunteers and mentors; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(5) Programs which provide encouragement and support to children through the use of mentors have resulted in significant increases in graduation rates at the secondary level and in much improved enrollment rates in postsecondary education for some of our most vulnerable youth; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(6) Local, regional, and state-wide resource referral systems must be established to link more efficiently children and potential academic volunteers and mentors with existing programs and organizations; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(7) Volunteer and mentor service must be encouraged and appropriately recognized. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to develop a state-wide strategy to provide academic support and guidance to each student who requires it, there is created the Georgia Mentoring Program, to be administered by the Governor's Office for Children and Families. Subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, the office shall: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) Develop a state-wide plan with the goal of matching every child who needs one with an academic mentor. For purposes of this Code section, the term "academic mentor" or "academic volunteer and mentor" means a volunteer who, as a participant in a local project funded under this Code section, supports the needs of the individual child with whom the volunteer is matched, including without limitation, strengthening the child's academic preparation and achievement; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) Develop standards for the operation of local projects for the provision of academic volunteer and mentor services; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) Develop criteria and procedures for funding local projects for the provision of academic volunteer and mentor services, based on local need. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to, the following indicators: size of the school age population, school dropout rates, and student achievement; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) Develop and implement a state-wide public awareness and recruitment campaign for academic mentors; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(5) Compile a state-wide resource directory of successful academic mentor programs and organizations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Governor's Office for Children and Families shall award grants to local school systems to administer the academic volunteer and mentor service program within the local school district, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly. Funds awarded under this Code section shall be expended exclusively for the recruitment, screening, training, and placement of academic mentors in accordance with the purposes of this Code section and for evaluation of the program established by this Code section. Local school systems which receive grants shall contract with nonprofit organizations or local government agencies for program operations. In selecting the organization or agency with which to contract, the local school system shall consider the experience of the organization or agency with operating volunteer mentor projects. Each entity receiving funds under this Code section shall consult and cooperate with any teacher in whose classroom it is proposed that an academic mentor be placed. No displacement of any certified or classified school employee shall occur as a result of the use of any academic mentor pursuant to this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">(1) A description of activities for which assistance is requested; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">(5) A statement of the applicant's experience in the recruitment, placement, and training of volunteers and mentors; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(6) A statement of how the applicant intends to recruit, screen, train, and place academic mentors; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(7) A statement of how the applicant will ensure that (A) academic volunteers and mentors will be required to undergo a criminal background check and (B) no displacement of existing school employees will occur as a result of the use of academic volunteers and mentors; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(8) A statement of the efforts the applicant will make to maximize the use of existing state, federal, and local funds from both public and private sources for the purposes of the project; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(9) A plan for integration of the applicant's efforts with other community based children's services. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly further finds that outstanding academic volunteer and mentor service should be encouraged and recognized. For that purpose, the Governor is authorized to provide an award to recognize outstanding academic volunteer or mentor service in the schools for each fiscal year in which funds are appropriated for the program established under this Code section. Local school systems may nominate an individual or individual program that has had a significant and positive impact upon the lives of children for the award. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Protection of children.</b> - Innocent foster children are entitled to greater protection than imprisoned criminals; thus, the professional judgment standard applies when determining issues of summary judgment.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of state.</b> - Once state officials have removed a child from his or her home, the officials have a constitutional duty to protect the child from harm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This duty includes an obligation to fund and implement safe and appropriate placements and services that do not substantially depart from accepted standards of professional judgment and do not unnecessarily interfere with the child's rights of familial association.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute does not grant adoption rights.</b> - Foster parents did not have standing to pursue an adoption of a foster child that had been living happily with the child's grandmother for three years because the biological parents did not surrender their rights in favor of the foster parents, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 19-8-5, and the Foster Parent's Bill of Rights, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 49-5-281, did not grant adoption rights.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unmarried individuals may adopt.</b> - Trial court abused the court's discretion by denying a foster parent's petition to adopt the foster child on the ground that placing the child with the foster parent, who was not married to the individual with whom the foster parent lived, violated the state's public policy because all of the evidence showed that the adoption would be in the child's best interest, and the trial court failed to apply the law as written and determine whether it was in the child's best interest to allow the adoption; all of the witnesses, including the guardian ad litem the trial court appointed to represent the child's interests and the Department of Family and Children's Services adoption specialist, testified that the adoption was in the child's best interest and that to remove the child from the only family the child had ever known would be devastating to the child, and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 19-8-3 clearly did not prohibit the adoption because the General Assembly did not prohibit unmarried couples from adopting.

<p class="p8">The purpose of this article is to assist functionally impaired elderly persons in living dignified and reasonably independent lives in their own homes or in the homes of relatives or caregivers through the development, expansion, reorganization, and coordination of various community based services. In recognition of the desire of older Georgians to reside at home or with their families as long as possible, the General Assembly intends that a continuum of care be established so that functionally impaired elderly persons age 60 and older may be assured the least restrictive environment suitable to their needs. The General Assembly further intends to maximize the utilization of existing community social and health services in order to prevent unnecessary placement of individuals in long-term care facilities. The development of innovative approaches to program management, staff training, and service delivery that impact on cost avoidance, cost effectiveness, and program efficiency shall be encouraged. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of Community Health shall serve as the agency responsible for planning and implementing the provision of community based services to the elderly reimbursable under the "Georgia Medical Assistance Act of 1977."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">"(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
