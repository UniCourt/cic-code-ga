<p class="p4"><b>Hearing of administrative appeal.</b> - Trial court had jurisdiction to hear administrative appeal regarding a solid waste handling permit granted by the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources when, even though the hearing was not held within 90 days because appellants kept postponing the hearing, the hearing was held within 30 days of the 90-day period on "a date certain."

<p class="p10">(6) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, whenever the division determines that a violation of any provision of this title or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to this title relating to those laws to be enforced by the division has occurred, the division shall be required to attempt by conference, conciliation, or persuasion to convince the violator to cease such violation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the director finds that the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action and incorporates a finding to that effect in his or her order, such order may summarily provide for the immediate cessation of any activity constituting such violation. Whether negotiated or directed, such order shall specify the alleged violation and shall prescribe a reasonable time for corrective action to be accomplished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any order issued pursuant to this subsection shall become final unless the person aggrieved requests a hearing in writing before the director not later than 30 days after such order is served. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever the Constitution and laws of the United States or the State of Georgia require the issuance of a warrant to make an inspection under any law administered by the director, the procedure set forth in paragraphs (1) through (7) of this subsection shall be employed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) The director or any person authorized to make inspections for the division shall make application for an inspection warrant to a person who is a judicial officer within the meaning of Code Section 17-5-21. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) An inspection warrant shall be issued only upon cause and when supported by an affidavit particularly describing the place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected and the purpose for which the inspection is to be made. In addition, the affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Cause shall be deemed to exist if either reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle, or there is reason to believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified therein, but not for a period of more than 14 days, unless extended or renewed by the judicial officer who signed and issued the original warrant, upon satisfying himself that such extension or renewal is in the public interest. Such inspection warrant must be executed and returned to the judicial officer by whom it was issued within the time specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the expiration of such time, the warrant, unless executed, is void. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) An inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant shall be made between 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. of any day or at any time during operating or regular business hours. An inspection should not be performed in the absence of an owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle unless specifically authorized by the judicial officer upon a showing that such authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the regulation being enforced. An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible entry where facts are shown which are sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a violation of this title, which, if such violation existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful. Where prior consent has been sought and refused and a warrant has been issued, the warrant may be executed without further notice to the owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to allow an inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant issued as provided in this subsection. Any person violating this paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Under this subsection, an inspection warrant is an order, in writing, signed by a judicial officer, directed to the director or any person authorized to make inspections for the division, and commanding him or her to conduct any inspection required or authorized by this title or regulations promulgated pursuant to this title. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an inspection warrant when a warrantless inspection is authorized by law or a permit issued under this title. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where this title does not otherwise specify the disposition of moneys collected by the division pursuant to an order issued by the director or the disposition of civil penalties collected by the division, such moneys and civil penalties shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the general fund but shall be available for appropriation by the General Assembly to the department for inclusion in the hazardous waste trust fund continued in existence by subsection (a) of Code Section 12-8-95 in keeping with the legislative intent expressed in subsection (b) of Code Section 12-8-91.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to address constitutional issue on part of trial court.</b> - Trial court erred by failing to address whether a 1993 county zoning ordinance was constitutional because the record established that the landfill permit applicant raised a constitutional challenge to the zoning ordinance before the trial court in its response to the challengers' motion for partial summary judgment and, in fact, in its transfer order to the appellate court, the trial court specifically stated that the court did not rule on the applicant's constitutional argument. Southern States-Bartow County, Inc. v. Riverwood Farm Prop. Owners Ass'n, Inc., 331 Ga. App. 878, 769 S.E.2d 823 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remedies.</b> - Superior court had jurisdiction to enter an injunction against the city to prevent the city from taking action on a siting decision for a landfill, when the city failed to follow the notice and meeting requirements for selecting and siting landfills, and aggrieved citizens did not have adequate remedy at law, because the existing landfill permit process and appeal under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-2-2 did not provide an administrative remedy to prevent the city's ultra vires actions. Emmons v. City of Arcade, 270 Ga. 196, 507 S.E.2d 464 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - Homeowners lacked standing to appeal consent orders entered by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources until the Director sought to enforce the orders, but the homeowners were authorized to sue those directly responsible for polluting the homeowners' property, irrespective of the homeowners' right of access to the courts; hence, the underlying intent of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-2-2(c)(3)(B) was to preclude such attacks on the director's exercise of the administrative authority to determine the scope of remedial measures set forth in consent orders issued under the Hazardous Site Response Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-8-90 et seq. Couch v. Parker, 280 Ga. 580, 630 S.E.2d 364 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Judicial review of air quality permit.</b> - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 7401 et seq., or the state implementation plan controlled or limited CO2 emissions. Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions. Longleaf Energy Assocs., LLC v. Friends of the Chattahoochee, Inc., 298 Ga. App. 753, 681 S.E.2d 203 (2009), cert. denied, No. S09C1879, 2009 Ga. LEXIS 809 (Ga. 2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to challenge consent order.</b> - Because a city could have challenged an agency consent order under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 12-2-2(c) and 50-13-19 but did not, the city's appeal of a judgment to enforce the consent order arose from proceedings under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-5-189; since the city did not appeal the director's decision, the appellate issue was limited to the propriety of the judgment and not the correctness of the decision. City of Rincon v. Couch, 272 Ga. App. 411, 612 S.E.2d 596 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Organization lacked standing to appeal consent order.</b> - Trial court erred by concluding that an organization had standing to appeal a consent order between a property owner and the Director of the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) with regard to soil erosion as it lacked standing to appeal based upon its inability to demonstrate redressability as it failed to identify a procedural requirement the EPD violated, and the consent order did not fall within the categories of orders that required provision of notice and opportunity for comment.

<p class="p10">The General Assembly finds that certain real property in Georgia, because it exhibits unique natural characteristics, special historical significance, or particular recreational value, constitutes a valuable heritage which should be available to all Georgians, now and in the future. The General Assembly further finds that much of this real property, because of Georgia's rapid progress over the past decade, has been altered, that its value as part of our heritage has been lost, and that such property which remains is in danger of being irreparably altered. The General Assembly declares, therefore, that there is an urgent public need to preserve important and endangered elements of Georgia's heritage, so as to allow present and future citizens to gain an understanding of their origins in nature and their roots in the culture of the past and to ensure a future sufficiency of recreational resources. The General Assembly asserts the public interest in the state's heritage by creating the Heritage Trust Program which shall be the responsibility of the Governor and the Department of Natural Resources and which shall seek to protect this heritage through the acquisition of fee simple title or lesser interests in valuable properties and by utilization of other available methods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">The department shall be guided by the following policies in creating and administering the Georgia Scenic Trails System:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10">(1) A balanced system of trails throughout the state should be sought, including, but not limited to, the following types of trails: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) <i>Urban trails. </i>These would be located within or close to urban centers and would accommodate intensive use from urban residents. Activities would include jogging, walking, and touring historic sites and other points of interest; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) <i>Bicycle trails. </i>These would be located in urban, suburban, or rural areas and should be easily accessible to population centers. Bicycle trails in urban areas should provide an acceptable alternative to certain motorized transportation, and the cyclist should be protected from motorized traffic capable of traveling over 20 miles per hour; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) <i>Horse trails. </i>These may extend through urban, suburban, rural, or wilderness areas and should be accessible to population centers. Supporting facilities may include stables, corrals, drinking water, primitive campsites, and shelter; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) <i>Rural hiking trails. </i>These would be accessible to, but not within, population centers and may traverse areas of historic or scenic interest, pastureland, and woodland. Activities would include hiking, walking, jogging, touring, camping, and fishing. Support facilities may include simple toilet facilities, drinking water, primitive campsites, and picnic tables and benches; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) <i>Primitive hiking trails. </i>These would be primarily to provide the beauty and inspiration of the wilderness experience to an increasingly urban society. They may traverse small areas of pastoral land or roadway but would be largely in undisturbed wilderness areas. Any facilities should be primitive in nature and widely separated; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(F) <i>Historical trails. </i>These would emphasize important events in the history of Georgia and would be appropriately marked to allow the user to become familiar with such history; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(G) <i>Bikeways. </i>These would be publicly owned and maintained paved paths, ways, or trails designated and signed as bicycle and electric assisted bicycle routes and located in urban, suburban, or rural areas. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the routes of such bikeways shall be determined by the local governing authority wherein such bikeways would be located and shall be approved by the Department of Transportation. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "electric assisted bicycle" shall have the same meaning as set forth in Code Section 40-1-1; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(H) <i>Combination trails. </i>These would be trails consisting of combinations of any of the types of trails described in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of this paragraph; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) The use of the trails should be limited to those activities for which intended, and appropriate steps should be taken to enforce this policy; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) The physical facilities provided for the trails, such as trail markers, signs, toilet facilities, shelters, drinking water, campsites, picnic tables, and parking areas, should be in keeping with the intended use of the trails and with health, sanitation, and safety requirements but should make minimum changes in the natural environment consistent with those objectives; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Assistance and encouragement should be provided for local governments in the development of trails, and a procedure should be adopted whereby such trails could be regulated and maintained as a part of the system; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) The advice, cooperation, and assistance of other state agencies, local governments and agencies thereof, and private associations and organizations should be sought in developing and maintaining the system; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Planning and developing the system should be coordinated with the regional commissions and the Department of Community Affairs; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) Trails should be planned, constructed, and maintained on a long-term basis, and in connection therewith long-term control of the land making up the trails should be established by the acquisition in fee simple of rights of way to such land or by leases, easements, or other appropriate long-term agreements; and where feasible, rights of way should be of sufficient width to preserve the recreational, scenic, or historical uniqueness of the trail; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) A program for the education of the public on the effective use and care of trails should be established.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture itself may contain such provisions for perfecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project or projects; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys and revenues. The resolution or trust indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

No holder of such bonds shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon, or to enforce the payment thereof against the property of the state, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The state covenants with the holders of the bonds that the authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired or leased by it, or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision, or upon its activities in the operation or maintenance of the buildings and facilities erected or acquired by it, or any fees, rentals, or other charges, for the use of such buildings, or any other income received by the authority.

The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and against the authority issuing the same and against any authority, subdivision, instrumentality, department, or agency contracting with the authority. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Upon completion of the staff review, the findings shall be submitted to the governing body of the hall of fame authority. Each hall of fame authority shall not later than April 30, 2011, submit to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairpersons of the Senate and House appropriations committees a report detailing the activities of the authority with respect to issuance of the request for proposals, receipt and evaluation of proposals, and the decision of the authority with respect to acceptance of proposals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman or vice chairman of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary or assistant secretary of the authority; and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairman or vice chairman of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person, and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The resolution or indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. The resolution or indenture may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

No holder, receiver, or trustee shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon, or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide for the conservation of nongame species of wildlife for the benefit and nonconsumptive use of the citizens of Georgia. Historically, wildlife conservation programs have been focused on the more recreationally and commercially important game species. As a consequence, such programs have been largely financed by hunting and fishing license revenues and by federal assistance based on excise taxes on certain hunting and fishing equipment. These traditional financing mechanisms are neither adequate nor fully appropriate to meet the needs of nongame wildlife conservation programs and wildlife habitat acquisition programs which enhance the protection of nongame species. It is the policy of this state to enable and encourage citizens voluntarily to support nongame wildlife conservation programs and wildlife habitat acquisition programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

This duty further requires that adequate protection be assured in any drilling or the use of such drilled wells in certain other environmentally sensitive areas or in other circumstances where the result of such drilling and use may endanger the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state. It is not the policy of the General Assembly to regulate the drilling of shallow exploration or engineering holes except in such environmentally sensitive areas as defined in this part. The General Assembly further finds and declares that oil and gas exploration to identify new sources of energy should not occur at the expense of our important natural resources such as residential, municipal, and industrial supplies of fresh water. The General Assembly further finds and declares that it should continue to encourage oil and gas exploration. The General Assembly further finds and declares that with an increase in oil exploration, it must provide assurances to persons engaging in such exploration that adequate safeguards regarding results of exploration will remain privileged information for a specified time. The General Assembly further finds and declares that it is in the public interest to obtain, protect, and disseminate all possible geologic information associated with drilling operations in order to further the purposes of future energy related research.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In regard to the establishment of drilling units and operation units, the allocation of production, the integration of separately owned tracts of land, and agreements in the interest of conservation, the board, in addition to the jurisdiction, authority, or powers granted elsewhere in this part, shall have the specific powers with respect to the exploration or production of oil or gas enumerated below. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) <i>Drilling units. </i>For the prevention of waste and to avoid the augmenting and accumulation of risk arising from the drilling of an excessive number of wells, the board shall, after due investigation and a hearing, have full power and authority to establish such drilling unit or units as may, in its discretion, seem most reasonable and practicable. The board shall have control of the allocation of production over such units and shall, after investigation and hearing, set up, establish, and allocate to each unit its just and equitable share of production, and shall make such orders, rules, and regulations as will give to each producer the opportunity to use his or her just and equitable share of the reservoir energy of any pool. The board shall have power after notice and hearing to review and approve, or disapprove, agreements made among owners or operators, or among owners and operators in the interest of conservation of oil or gas or both or for the prevention of waste. When two or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced within an established drilling unit, the owners thereof may validly agree to integrate their interests and to develop their lands as a drilling unit. Where, however, such owners have not agreed to integrate their interests, the board may, for the prevention of waste or to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, after notice and hearing, require such owners to do so and to develop their lands as a drilling unit. Should the owners of separate tracts embraced within a drilling unit fail to agree upon the integration of the tracts and the drilling of a well on the unit, and should it be established that the board is without authority to require integration as provided for above, then subject to all other applicable provisions of this part, the owner of each tract embraced within the drilling unit may drill on his or her tract, but the allowable production from said tract shall be such proportion of the allowable production for the full drilling unit as the area of such separately owned tracts bears to the full drilling unit. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) <b>Operation units. </b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) For the prevention of waste and to assure the ultimate recovery of gas or oil, the board may hold a hearing to consider the need for the operation as a unit of an entire field, or of any pool or any portion thereof, or combination of pools, within a field, for the production of oil or gas or both and other minerals which may be associated and produced therewith by additional recovery methods. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) At the conclusion of the hearing the board shall issue an order requiring unit operation if it finds that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(i) Unit operation of the field, or of any pool or of any portion or combinations thereof within the field, is reasonably necessary to prevent waste as defined in Code Section 12-4-42 or to increase the ultimate recovery of oil or gas by additional recovery methods; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(ii) The estimated additional cost incident to the conduct of such operation will not exceed the value of the estimated additional recovery of oil or gas; provided, however, that the board shall be authorized to prohibit the production of gas or oil by any recovery method if it has determined that such recovery method will result in waste or reduce the ultimate recovery of gas or oil from any field or pool or portion or combination thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) The phrase "additional recovery methods" as used in this subsection shall include, but shall not be limited to, the maintenance or partial maintenance of reservoir pressures by any method recognized by the industry and approved by the board; recycling; flooding a pool or pools, or parts thereof, with air, gas, water, liquid hydrocarbons or any other substance, or any combination or combinations thereof; or any other secondary method of producing hydrocarbons recognized by the industry and approved by the board. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) The order provided for in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be fair and reasonable under all the circumstances, shall protect the rights of interested parties, and shall include: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(i) A description of the area embraced, termed the unit area, and a description of the affected pool or pools, or portions thereof, which lie within the unit area; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(ii) A statement of the nature of the operations contemplated; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(iii) A method of allocation among the separately owned tracts in the unit area of all the oil or gas or both produced from the unit pool within the unit area and not required in the conduct of such operation or unavoidably lost, such method of allocation to be on a formula that is fair and equitable and will protect the correlative rights of all interested parties; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(iv) A provision for adjustment among the owners of the unit area (not including royalty owners) of their respective investments in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials, equipment, and other things and services of value attributable to the unit operations. The amount to be charged unit operations for any such item shall be determined by the owners of the unit area (not including royalty owners); provided, however, that if such owners of the unit area are unable to agree upon the amount of such charges, or to agree upon the correctness thereof, the board shall determine the amount after due notice and hearing thereon. The net amount charged against the owners of a separately owned tract shall be considered expense of unit operation chargeable against such tract. The adjustment provided for in this division may be treated separately and handled by agreements separate from the unitization agreement; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(v) A provision that the costs and expenses of unit operations, including investment, past and prospective, be charged to the separately owned tracts in the same proportions that such tracts share in unit productions. The expenses chargeable to a tract shall be paid by the person or persons not entitled to share in production free of operating costs, and who, in the absence of unit operation, would be responsible for the expense of developing and operating such tracts, and such person's or persons' interest in the separately owned tract shall be primarily responsible therefor. The obligation or liability of such persons in the several, separately owned tracts for the payment of unit expense shall at all times be several and not joint or collective. The unit operator shall have a first and prior lien upon the leasehold estate exclusive of the royalty interest provided thereby and unleased oil and gas rights, exclusive of one-eighth interest therein, in and to each separately owned tract, and the interest of the owners thereof in and to the unit production and all equipment in possession of the unit, to secure the payment of the amount of the unit expense charged to and assessed against such separately owned tract; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(vi) The designation of, or a provision for the selection of, a unit operator. The conduct of all unit operations by the unit operator and the selection of a successor to the unit operator shall be governed by the terms and provisions of the unitization agreements; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(vii) A provision that when the full amount of any charge made against any interest in a separately owned tract is not paid when due by the person or persons primarily responsible therefor, then all of the oil and gas production allocated to the interest in default in such separately owned tract, upon which production the unit operator has a lien, may be appropriated by the unit operator and marketed and sold for the payment of such charge, together with interest at a fair and equitable rate as determined by the board thereon. The remaining portion of the unit production or the proceeds derived therefrom allocated to each separately owned tract shall in all events be regarded as royalty to be paid to the owners, free and clear of all unit expense and free and clear of any lien therefor. The owner of any overriding royalty, oil and gas payment, or other interest, who is not primarily responsible for the unpaid obligation, shall, to the extent of any payment or deduction from his or her share, be subrogated to all the rights of the unit operator with respect to the interest or interests primarily responsible for such payment. Any surplus received by the operator from any such sale of production shall be credited to the person or persons from whom it was deducted in the proportion of their respective interest; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(viii) The time the unit operation shall become effective, and the manner in which, and the circumstances under which, the unit operation shall terminate. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) An order requiring unit operation shall not become effective unless and until a contract incorporating the unitization agreement has been signed or in writing ratified or approved by the owners of at least 85 percent in interest as costs are shared under the terms of the order and by 85 percent in interest, as production is to be allocated, of the royalty owners in the unit area, and unless and until a contract incorporating the required arrangements for operations has been signed or in writing ratified or approved by the owners of at least 85 percent in interest as costs are shared, and unless and until the board has made a finding, either in the order or in a supplemental order, that those contracts have been signed, ratified, or approved. Both contracts may be encompassed in a single document. In the event the required percentage interests have not signed, ratified, or approved such agreements within six months from and after the date of such order, or within such extended period as the board may prescribe, the order shall be automatically revoked. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(F) (i) The board, by entry of new or amending orders, may from time to time add to unit operations portions of pools not theretofore included, and may add to unit operations new pools or portions thereof, and may extend the unit area as required. Any such order, in providing for allocation of production from a unitized zone of the unit area, shall first allocate to such pool or pools, or portion thereof so added, a portion of the total production of oil or gas, or both, from all pools affected within the unit area, as enlarged and not required in the conduct of unit operations or unavoidably lost. Such allocation shall be based on a formula for sharing that is considered to treat each tract and each owner fairly and equitably during the remaining course of unit operations. The production so allocated to such added pool or pools or portions thereof shall be allocated to the separately owned tracts which participate in such production on a fair and equitable basis. The remaining portion of unit production shall be allocated among the separately owned tracts within the previously established unit area in the same proportions as those specified prior to the enlargement unless such proportions are shown to be erroneous by data developed subsequent to the former determination, in which event the errors shall be corrected. Orders promulgated under this Code section shall become operative at 7:00 A.M. on the first day of the month next following the day on which the order becomes effective. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(ii) An order promulgated by the board under this subparagraph shall not become effective unless and until: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(I) All of the terms and provisions of the unitization agreement relating to the extension or enlargement of the unit area or to the addition of pools or portions thereof to unit operations have been fulfilled and satisfied, and evidence thereof has been submitted to the board; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(II) The extension or addition effected by such order has been agreed to in writing by the owners of at least 85 percent in interest as costs are shared in the area or pools or portions thereof to be added to the unit operation by such order and by 85 percent in interest, as production is to be allocated, of the royalty owners in the area or pools or portions thereof to be added to the unit operations by such order, and evidence thereof has been submitted to the board. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(iii) In the event both of the requirements specified in subdivisions (I) and (II) of division (ii) of this subparagraph are not fulfilled within six months from and after the date of such order or within such extended period as the board may prescribe, the order shall be automatically revoked. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(G) When the contribution of a separately owned tract with respect to any unit pool has been established, such contribution shall not be subsequently altered except to correct a mathematical or clerical error that caused the tract contribution to be erroneous, unless an enlargement of the unit is effected. No change or correction of the contribution of any separately owned tract shall be given retroactive effect, but appropriate adjustment shall be made for the investment charges as provided in this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(H) The portion of unit production allocated to a separately owned tract within the unit area shall be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such tract, and operations with respect to any unit pool within the unit area shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be the conduct of operations for the production of oil or gas, or both, from each separately owned tract in the unit area. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Owners, operators, and royalty owners who have separate holdings in the same oil or gas pool or in any area that appears from geological or other data to be underlaid by a common accumulation of oil or gas or both are authorized to make agreements among themselves for establishing and carrying out a plan for the cooperative development and operation of the pool or area, provided that such agreements must be approved by the board; provided, further, that such agreements must be for the purpose of conserving gas or oil or both, or for the prevention of waste, or to assure the ultimate recovery of gas or oil or both. Such agreements shall not be held or construed to violate any of the laws of this state relating to trusts, monopolies, or contracts and combinations in restraint of trade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">"(2) The district attorney whose circuit includes the county in which the seizure is made, within 30 days after the seizure of any illegal minerals or illegal products, shall institute proceedings by petition in the superior court of any county where the seizure was made against the property so seized and against any and all persons known to have an interest in or right affected by the seizure or sale of such property. A copy of such petition shall be served upon the owner or lessee of such property, if known, and upon the person or persons having custody or possession of such property at the time of the confiscation or seizure. If the owner or lessee or person or persons having custody or possession of such property at the time of seizure is unknown, notice of such proceedings shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in the newspaper in which sheriff's advertisements of the county are published. Such publication shall be deemed notice to any and all persons having an interest in or right affected by such proceeding and any sale of the property resulting therefrom. If no defense or intervention shall be filed within 30 days from the filing of the petition, judgment by default shall be entered by the court; otherwise the case shall proceed as civil cases.

<p class="p6"><b>OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Affected land" construed.</b> - Term "affected land" as utilized in paragraph (1) of this section is a technical concept; land which might be commonly termed affected in the everyday sense of the word only falls within the technical concept if the affecting operations take place after the effective date of this section. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-30 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-4-72). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"Affected land" is to be defined to include each clause separately within the definition. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-30.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Affected land" includes</b> lands used as a spoil area beyond an actual mining pit location and lands previously affected by surface mining operations and subjected to additional excavation of minerals or deposition of spoilage. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-291.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What constitutes "overburden".</b> - Surface waters of an area that is diked and pumped so as to permit mining directly from exposed deposits can constitute overburden subject to coverage of paragraph (8) of this section. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-25 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-4-72).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Scope of "pit".</b> - "Pit" as defined in paragraph (10) of this section is limited to dry land borrow pits, not dredging operations. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-35 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-4-72). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When "surface mining" occurs.</b> - Surface mining, as defined in paragraph (15), occurs when mining involves the removal of the earth and other materials lying above natural deposits so as to mine directly from the natural deposits thereby exposed; the mining must be directly from exposed natural deposits and not indirectly through another medium. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-25 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-4-72). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>"Surface mining" does not occur</b> when there is dredging or ocean mining of materials normally covered by natural surface water without diking and pumping so as to expose the natural deposits to direct removal. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-25. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">On-site grading and excavation preparatory to construction is excluded from the definition of "surface mining" because such excavation and on-site preparation do not involve mining for sale, processing, or consumption in the regular operation of a business. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-33.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Time certificates not acceptable alternative under bonding requirement of paragraph (3).</b> - Time certificates, issued by a national bank doing business in Georgia, do not constitute an acceptable alternative under the bonding requirement of paragraph (3) of this section since, as obligations of a banking corporation, the certificates are neither cash nor government securities. 1970 Op.

<p class="p10">The State of Georgia finds that caves are uncommon geologic phenomena and that the minerals deposited therein may be rare and occur in unique forms of great beauty which are irreplaceable if destroyed. It is also found that the wildlife which have evolved to live in caves are unusual and of limited numbers, and many are rare and endangered species, and that caves are a natural conduit for ground-water flow and are highly subject to water pollution, which has far-reaching effects transcending man's property boundaries. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state and the intent of this article to protect these unique natural resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Wholesale water quality degradation was held justifiable</b> to provide necessary social or economic development, and a permit to allow the county to discharge 40 million gallons of treated wastewater into a lake on a daily basis did not require the highest and best level of treatment practicable under existing technology because: (1) the projected population growth in the county would require additional wastewater capacity by the year 2005, and continued growth would require the level of capacity provided by the permit sometime between 2010 and 2015; (2) sufficient land was not available for land application of wastewater; and (3) there was a need to return water to the water system from which the county draws the county's water supply, and the cycling of treated wastewater taken from the Chattahoochee River system and returned to that system would aid negotiations concerning an interstate compact regarding these waters.

<p class="p4"><b>Interpretation of narrative standard rule as to discharges.</b> - Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division's (EPD's) interpretation of the narrative standard was entitled to deference as it was proper for the EPD to interpret the narrative standard as not intended to convert the designated use of a water body to a more protected use as the plain language of the narrative standard does not specify the degree of interference with legitimate water uses that would constitute a violation of the rule. Altamaha Riverkeeper, Inc. v. Rayonier Performance Fibers, LLC, 346 Ga. App. 269, 816 S.E.2d 125 (2018), cert. denied, 2019 Ga. LEXIS 554 (Ga. 2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Antidegradation rule did not apply to nonpoint sources.</b> - Water quality standard in Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 391-3-6-.03(2)(b)(ii) did not require antidegradation analysis for nonpoint sources of pollution and, therefore, did not apply to a city's permit for a land application system, which involved spraying wastewater treated to remove solids and break down organic waste onto a tract of land.

<p class="p10">(3) (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section to the contrary, a permit for the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm uses shall be issued by the director to any person when the applicant submits an application which provides reasonable proof that the applicant's farm use of surface waters occurred prior to July 1, 1988, and when any such application is submitted prior to July 1, 1991. If submitted prior to July 1, 1991, an application for a permit to be issued based upon farm uses of surface waters occurring prior to July 1, 1988, shall be granted for the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters at a rate of withdrawal or diversion equal to the greater of the operating capacity in place for withdrawal or diversion on July 1, 1988, or, when measured in gallons per day on a monthly average for a calendar year, the greatest withdrawal or diversion capacity during the five-year period immediately preceding July 1, 1988. If submitted after July 1, 1991, or, regardless of when submitted, if it is based upon a withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm uses occurring or proposed to occur on or after July 1, 1988, an application shall be subject to evaluation and classification pursuant to subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this Code section, but a permit based upon such evaluation and classification shall be issued to ensure the applicant's right to a reasonable use of such surface waters. Any permit issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be conditioned upon the requirement that the permittee shall provide, on forms prescribed by the director, information relating to a general description of the lands and number of acres subject to irrigation and the permit; a description of the general type of irrigation system used; the source of withdrawal water such as river, stream, or impoundment; and pump information, including rated capacity, pump location, and power information. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) Permits applied for under this paragraph on or after April 20, 2006, for farm use in the Flint River basin shall have a term of 25 years and shall be automatically renewed at the original permitted capacity unless an evaluation by the division indicates that renewal at the original capacity would have unreasonable adverse effects upon other water uses. The division may renew the original permit at a lower capacity, but such capacity shall be based on the reasonable use of the permittee and evaluation of the resource. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Administrative law judge's final decision not subject to challenge.</b> - Administrative law judge's affirmance of the Georgia environmental department's denial of a city's application for an additional groundwater withdrawal permit was not error because the denial was based on the conditions encompassed in a prior consent order that required the city to take various measures to obtain more groundwater as there was no issue regarding whether the city's current and projected water needs could be satisfied by carrying out the provisions of the consent order, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-5-96(d)(1); claims that were not challenged previously became final pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-5-185 and could not be collaterally attacked under res judicata principles.

<p class="p4"><b>Factors considered for groundwater withdrawal permit.</b> - Georgia environmental department was not required to grant a city's application for a groundwater withdrawal permit merely because no adverse effect on other users was shown as there were other circumstances that supported denial of the permit request, pursuant to Ga.

If submitted prior to July 1, 1991, an application for a permit to be issued based upon farm uses of ground water occurring prior to July 1, 1988, shall be granted for the withdrawal of ground water at a rate of withdrawal equal to the greater of the operating capacity in place for withdrawal on July 1, 1988, or, when measured in gallons per day on a monthly average for a calendar year, the greatest withdrawal capacity during the five-year period immediately preceding July 1, 1988. If submitted after July 1, 1991, or, regardless of when submitted, if it is based upon a withdrawal of ground water for farm uses occurring or proposed to occur on or after July 1, 1988, an application shall be subject to evaluation and classification pursuant to Code Sections 12-5-96 and 12-5-97, but a permit based upon such evaluation and classification shall be issued to ensure the applicant's right to a reasonable use of such ground water. Applications under this Code section submitted on or after April 20, 2006, for farm use within the Flint River basin shall be assessed a nonrefundable application fee in the amount of $250.00 per application. Any permit issued pursuant to this Code section shall be further conditioned upon the requirement that the permittee shall provide, on forms prescribed by the director, information relating to a general description of the lands and number of acres subject to irrigation and the permit; the name and address of the permittee; a description of the general type of irrigation system used; well construction; and pump information, including rated capacity, pump setting depth, and power information. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notwithstanding any provisions of Code Section 12-5-95, 12-5-96, or 12-5-97 to the contrary, permits to withdraw, obtain, or utilize ground waters for farm uses, as that term is defined in paragraph (5.1) of Code Section 12-5-92, whether for new withdrawals or under subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be governed as follows: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Permits applied for under this Code section on or after April 20, 2006, for farm use within the Flint River basin shall have a term of 25 years and shall be automatically renewed at the original permitted capacity unless an evaluation by the division indicates that renewal at the original capacity would have unreasonable adverse effects upon other water uses. The division may renew the original permit at a lower capacity, but such capacity shall be based on the reasonable use of the permittee and evaluation of the resource; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) A permittee may apply to have a permit issued under this Code section modified, amended, transferred, or assigned to subsequent owners of the lands which are the subject of such permit; provided, however, that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) The division shall receive written notice of any such transfer or assignment; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(C) The permittee may commence withdrawing water under the modified, amended, transferred, or assigned permit on the effective date stated on the revised permit for farm use; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) For all permits for which such modification, amendment, transfer, or assignment is effective on or after April 20, 2018, and for which no water-measuring device is installed, the permittee shall have one year from the updated effective date stated on the revised permit for farm use to have an acceptable type of water-measuring device installed, to have such device in operation at each point of permitted withdrawal, and to notify the division in writing once the installation has occurred. The division shall approve or disapprove the installation within 60 days of the date of notification. The permittee shall be responsible for all associated costs; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Permits for farm use, after initial use has commenced, shall not be revoked, in whole or in part, for nonuse; except that the director may permanently revoke any permit under this Code section for farm use within the Flint River Basin applied for on or after April 20, 2006, if initial use for the purpose indicated on the permit application, as measured by a flow meter approved by the division has not commenced within two years of the date of issuance of the permit unless the permittee can reasonably demonstrate that his or her nonuse was due to financial hardship or circumstances beyond his or her control; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) The director may suspend or modify a permit for farm use if he or she should determine through inspection, investigations, or otherwise that the quantity of water allowed would prevent other applicants from reasonable use of ground water beneath their property for farm use; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) During emergency periods of water shortage, the director shall give first priority to providing water for human consumption and second priority to farm use; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(B) May receive and use state appropriations, gifts, grants, or other sources of funding to carry out its duties; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) Shall develop a priority system for the installation of devices for measurement of farm uses of water at the points of those withdrawals for which a permit was issued as of July 1, 2003. The division may refine the priority system from time to time based on the amount of funding received by the division, considerations regarding cost effectiveness, new technical information, changes in resource use or conditions, or other factors as deemed relevant by the director; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) Shall, on behalf of the state, contract for the purchase and installation of that subset of water-measuring devices according to the priority system required by this Code section, and no charge shall be made to the permittee for such costs. However, when the division assesses the site or attempts to install such water-measuring devices and finds that the site lacks the withdrawal or irrigation infrastructure, the division shall document such withdrawal or irrigation infrastructure conditions and notify the permittee in writing that a state funded water-measuring device or devices could not be installed and that a device or devices are still required. After the expiration of five years, such permittee shall be responsible for having an acceptable type of water-measuring device installed and placed into operation and all associated costs. The permittee shall notify the division in writing once the installation has occurred. The division shall approve or disapprove the installation within 60 days of the date of notification; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) Shall, at monthly intervals, read an appropriate proportion of water-measuring devices installed for measuring farm use of ground water and compile the collected data for use in meeting the purposes in paragraph (1) of this Code section, and the division shall communicate in advance with private property owners to establish reasonable times for such readings. In the event that a permittee's water-measuring devices are selected for monthly readings, the permittee may choose to perform those readings and transmit that information to the division; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(F) Shall issue an annual progress report on the status of water-measuring device installation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Any person whose permit for agricultural water use was issued before July 1, 2003, and who desires to install a water-measuring device at no cost to the state may do so, provided that the permittee shall have an acceptable type of water-measuring device installed and placed in operation at each point of permitted withdrawal and the permittee shall notify the division in writing once the installation has occurred. The division shall approve or disapprove the installation within 60 days of the date of notification. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Any person who desires to commence a farm use of water for which a permit is issued after July 1, 2003, shall not commence such use prior to receiving approval from the division that such person has installed an acceptable type of water-measuring device installed by the commission at each point of permitted withdrawal. The permittee shall be responsible for all such costs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) Regarding all permits for which a water-measuring device is installed, regardless of when the permit was issued, the division shall contract for the annual reading of such water-measuring devices. The division shall require each contractor conducting such annual readings to transmit complete and accurate data required by the division to the division annually. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) The division shall audit a subset of reported water-measuring device readings submitted by permittees for the purpose of understanding and improving the accuracy of such readings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) Employees, contractors, or agents of the division are authorized to enter upon private property at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to conduct the duties of the division under this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) The division shall contract for any maintenance, repair, or replacement of water-measuring devices installed pursuant to this Code section where maintenance, repair, or replacement is required to ensure that such water-measuring devices accurately reflect the amount of water used, and no charge shall be made to the permittee for such costs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(9) If the division determines that the permittee or the permittee's employees, tenants, licensees, or agents have willfully dismantled, sold, relocated, or removed any water-measuring device installed pursuant to this Code Section, the permittee may be subject to enforcement action by the division, including but not limited to imposition of civil penalties. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(10) Any reports of amounts of use for recreational purposes under this part shall be compiled separately from amounts reported for all other farm uses. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing in this Code section shall be construed as a repeal or modification of Code Section 12-5-104. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to the other provisions of this Code section, there shall be established three categories of farm use ground-water withdrawal permits: active, inactive, and unused. The rules and regulations implementing this subsection shall provide without limitation for the following: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) An active farm use ground-water withdrawal permit means one that has been acted upon and used for allowable purposes; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">The General Assembly finds and declares that coastal sand dunes, beaches, sandbars, and shoals comprise a vital natural resource system, known as the sand-sharing system, which acts as a buffer to protect real and personal property and natural resources from the damaging effects of floods, winds, tides, and erosion. It is recognized that the coastal sand dunes are the most inland portion of the sand-sharing system and that because the dunes are the fragile product of shoreline evolution, they are easily disturbed by actions harming their vegetation or inhibiting their natural development. The General Assembly further finds that offshore sandbars and shoals are the system's first line of defense against the potentially destructive energy generated by winds, tides, and storms, and help to protect the onshore segment of the system by acting as reservoirs of sand for the beaches. Removal of sand from these bars and shoals can interrupt natural sand flows and can have unintended, undesirable, and irreparable effects on the entire sand-sharing system, particularly when the historical patterns of sand and water flows are not considered and accommodated. Also, it is found that ocean beaches provide an unparalleled natural recreation resource which has become vitally linked to the economy of Georgia's coastal zone and to that of the entire state. The General Assembly further finds that this natural resource system is costly, if not impossible, to reconstruct or rehabilitate once adversely affected by man related activities and is important to conserve for the present and future use and enjoyment of all citizens and visitors to this state and that the sand-sharing system is an integral part of Georgia's barrier islands, providing great protection to the state's marshlands and estuaries. The General Assembly further finds that this sand-sharing system is a vital area of the state and is essential to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens of the state. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the management of the sand-sharing system has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and consequently is properly a matter for regulation under the police power of the state. The General Assembly further finds and declares that activities and structures on offshore sandbars and shoals, for all purposes except federal navigational activities, must be regulated to ensure that the values and functions of the sand-sharing system are not impaired. It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this part to protect this vital natural resource system by allowing only activities and alterations of the sand dunes and beaches which are considered to be in the best interest of the state and which do not substantially impair the values and functions of the sand-sharing system and by authorizing the local units of government of the State of Georgia to regulate activities and alterations of the ocean sand dunes and beaches and recognizing that, if the local units of government fail to carry out the policies expressed in this part, it is essential that the department undertake such regulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The committee in determining an emergency shall base its determination on imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare or a grave danger to life, real property, structures, or shoreline engineering activities. If the committee makes such a finding of an emergency, the permittee may commence immediately or continue the construction or alteration authorized by the permit, but such construction or alteration is undertaken at the risk to the permittee of an administrative or judicial order requiring the sand dunes, beaches, and submerged lands to be returned to their condition prior to such construction or alteration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Landowners not entitled to a hearing regarding neighbors' planned dock.</b> - Landowners' claims against the state for declaratory judgment, mandamus, an unconstitutional taking, and due process and equal protection violations, all arising out of the issuance of a license to their neighbors to build a private dock in a coastal marshland area, all failed. The Coastal Marshlands Protection Act did not apply to a private dock, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-5-295(7); therefore, the landowners were not entitled to a hearing under the Act pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 12-5-283(b) and the Administrative Procedure Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 50-13-13(a) and 50-13-2(2).

<p class="p10">The General Assembly finds and declares that the coastal area of Georgia comprises a vital natural resource system. The General Assembly recognizes that the coastal area of Georgia is the habitat of many species of marine life and wildlife which must have clean waters and suitable habitat to survive. The General Assembly further finds that intensive research has revealed that activities affecting the coastal area may degrade water quality or damage coastal resources if not properly planned and managed. The General Assembly further finds that the coastal area provides a natural recreation resource which has become vitally linked to the economy of Georgia's coast and to that of the entire state. The General Assembly further finds that resources within this coastal area are costly, if not impossible, to reconstruct or rehabilitate once adversely affected by human related activities and it is important to conserve these resources for the present and future use and enjoyment of all citizens and visitors to this state. The General Assembly further finds that the coastal area is a vital area of the state and that it is essential to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens of the state. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the management of the coastal area has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and consequently is properly a matter for coordinated regulation under the police power of the state. The General Assembly further finds and declares that activities and structures in the coastal area must be regulated to ensure that the values and functions of coastal waters and natural habitats are not impaired and to fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as public trustees of the coastal waters and habitats for succeeding generations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The purpose of this part is to provide a method whereby political subdivisions in certain metropolitan areas shall utilize the police power of the state, in accordance with a comprehensive plan, to protect consistently the water quality of any major stream, the public water supplies of such political subdivision and of the area, recreational values of the major stream, and private property rights of landowners; to prevent activities which contribute to floods and flood damage; to control erosion, siltation, and intensity of development; to provide for the location and design of land uses in such a way as to minimize the adverse impact of development on the major stream and flood plains; and to provide for comprehensive planning for the stream corridor in such areas. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In preparing, adopting, and updating the plan, the commission shall be authorized to account for the varying characteristics of different sections of the stream corridor and set land use criteria accordingly. At least eight weeks prior to adoption of a plan for all land brought within the stream corridor on or after July 1, 1998, notice that the property is subject to the "Metropolitan River Protection Act," including notice of the process of adoption of the plan to be followed by the commission, shall be provided by United States mail to each property owner within the affected portion of the stream corridor as shown by the prior year's property tax records. The failure of any owner to actually receive such notice shall not affect the applicability of the plan to such owner's property or create any cause of action for damages or equitable relief. The plan, as adopted by the commission, shall be transmitted to each political subdivision by June 16, 1973. The plan as adopted by the commission for any and all land brought within the stream corridor after March 1, 1983, shall be transmitted to each political subdivision and to the director by July 1, 1983. The plan adopted by the commission for any and all land brought within the stream corridor on or after July 1, 1998, shall be transmitted to each political subdivision and to the director by October 1, 1998. The commission may, after hearing, utilize or adopt an existing plan or plans as the plan called for by this part. The commission may from time to time revise the plan or portions thereof, and any such revisions of the plan shall be transmitted promptly after adoption. Prior to the adoption of the plan, or of any substantial portion or any revision of the plan, the commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed plan, or portion or revision thereof, in each county in which any land affected by the plan or, in the case of a portion or revision of the plan, in which any land affected by such portion or revision lies.

In the event the total balance of unexpended drought protection funds at the end of a fiscal year is less than $5 million, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the total balance of unexpended drought protection funds be replenished to at least $10 million at the earliest possible time.

<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly recognizes the value of the metropolitan North Georgia area watersheds for water supply, recreation, habitat for fish and wildlife, economic prosperity, and quality of life. The General Assembly finds that adequate supplies of clean water for drinking and other purposes constitute the lifeblood of the metropolitan North Georgia area and are, therefore, essential to the health, welfare, and economic progress of the area. The purpose of this article is to create a planning entity dedicated to developing comprehensive regional and watershed-specific plans to be implemented by local governments in the district. These plans will protect water quality and public water supplies in and downstream of the region, protect recreational values of the waters in and downstream of the region, and minimize potential adverse impacts of development on waters in and downstream of the region. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The General Assembly further finds that the forest industry is of fundamental importance to the economy of the State of Georgia and that increased reforestation is necessary to meet future demands for forest products and to promote economic development and additional employment opportunities within this state. The General Assembly further finds that many acres of farm land and other open land in Georgia are not currently being used to the best advantage and that a program to provide incentives to encourage reforestation on these lands would be of great benefit to the people of Georgia. The General Assembly further finds that increased reforestation would substantially reduce soil erosion, which continues to be a serious problem in Georgia, and would be of other value in preserving and protecting wildlife and other natural resources of this state. It is determined, therefore, that it is in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare and would serve an important public purpose for the State Forestry Commission to establish a reforestation incentives program for the State of Georgia. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is declared by the General Assembly that prescribed burning is a resource protection and land management tool which benefits the safety of the public, Georgia's forest resources, the environment, and the economy of the state. The General Assembly finds that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Prescribed burning reduces naturally occurring vegetative fuels within forested areas. Reduction of such fuels by burning reduces the risk and severity of major wildfire, thereby lessening the threat of fire and the resulting loss of life and property; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Georgia's ever-increasing population situates urban development directly adjacent to fire prone forest lands. The use of prescribed fire to manage fuels in interface areas would substantially reduce the threat of damaging wildfire in urban communities; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Forest land constitutes significant economic, biological, and aesthetic resources of state-wide importance. Prescribed burning on forest land serves to reduce hazardous accumulations of fuels, prepare sites for both natural and artificial forest regeneration, improve wildlife habitat, control insects and disease, and perpetuate fire dependent ecosystems; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) State and federally owned public use lands such as state parks, state and national forests, and wildlife refuges receive resource enhancement through use of prescribed burning; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) As Georgia's population continues to grow, pressures from liability issues and smoke nuisance complaints cause prescribed burn practitioners to limit prescribed burn activity, thus reducing the above-mentioned benefits to the state; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Public misunderstanding of the benefit of prescribed burning to the ecological and economic welfare of the state exerts unusual pressures that prevent uninhibited use of this valuable forest resource management tool; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) Fire benefits rare, threatened, and endangered plants, deer, turkey, quail, dove, and other game as well as numerous songbirds and other nongame species by the increased growth and yields of herbs and legumes. It also allows openings for feeding and travel. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the purpose of this part to authorize and promote the continued use of prescribed burning for community protection, silvicultural, environmental, and wildlife management purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly finds that certain real property in Georgia, because it exhibits unique natural characteristics, special historical significance, or particular recreational value, constitutes a valuable heritage which should be protected to provide benefits to all Georgians, now and in the future. The General Assembly specifically recognizes that the forest lands and resources of the state are a natural resource of great economic value to the citizens of the state, not only for the potential production of forest products which they can provide, but also for the enormously valuable natural benefits they impart to the citizens of Georgia, such as air and water quality improvements, water storage, control of erosion, temperature moderation, habitat for native plants and wildlife, and opportunities for recreation in a natural, historic Georgia environment. Natural forested lands also allow present and future citizens to gain an understanding of the prehistoric and early culture of this region. Commercial forests provide traditional jobs, support our economy, and reflect the importance this industry has had in the development of Georgia. The General Assembly further finds that many of the forest resources of the state are under pressure to be converted to other uses because of Georgia's rapid progress and increased population over the past decades. As forest lands are converted to other uses and irreparably altered, a valuable part of our cultural heritage is lost as well as the natural benefits those forest lands provide. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly declares, therefore, that there is a compelling public need to preserve forest lands as an element of Georgia's heritage. The General Assembly asserts the public interest in the state's heritage by creating the Forest Heritage Trust Program, which shall be the responsibility of the Governor and the State Forestry Commission and which shall seek to protect this heritage through the acquisition of fee simple title or lesser interests in valuable properties and by utilization of other available methods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">It is found that soil erosion and sediment deposition onto lands and into waters within the watersheds of this state are occurring as a result of widespread failure to apply proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities and that such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of state waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resource uses. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state and the intent of this chapter to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities and programs of this state and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a state-wide comprehensive soil erosion and sediment control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air, and other resources of this state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

One such requirement is a letter from the proper local governing body assuring the EPD that the operation of a sanitary landfill on that particular tract will comply with local zoning regulations.

As the case involved permitting requirements for landfills, it concerned a statutory scheme requiring a permit from the state for a land use that was regulated by the state, and the LLLP was entitled to a direct appeal from the denial of its mandamus action.

<p class="p4"><b>Permanent injunction prohibited.</b> - Even though a city's failure to hold a properly noticed meeting at which a siting decision was made rendered invalid a contract between the city and a private developer regarding a proposed landfill, the city could not be prevented from holding a properly noticed meeting and it was error to grant a permanent injunction against the city's taking action in furtherance of the landfill.

<p class="p10">(4) "Engineering controls" means any physical mechanism, device, measure, system, or actions taken at a property that minimize the potential for exposure, control migration or dispersal, or maintain the effectiveness of other remedial actions. Engineering controls may include, without limitation, caps, covers, physical barriers, containment structures, leachate collection systems, ground water or surface water control systems, solidification, stabilization, treatment, fixation, slurry walls, and vapor control systems. Engineered property development features shall be acceptable as engineering controls provided these features physically control or eliminate the potential for exposure to contaminants of concern or control migration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) "Exposure" means contact of a constituent of concern with a receptor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) "Exposure domain" means the contaminated geographical area or areas of a site that can result in exposure to a particular receptor by a specified exposure pathway: the soil exposure domain for routine surficial contact with site soils is the soil area impacted by site constituents of concern from the ground surface down to a depth of two feet below ground surface; the soil exposure domain for exposure of construction workers or underground utility workers is the impacted area of site soils from the ground surface down to the depth of construction; and the soil exposure domain for protection of groundwater at an established point of exposure is the impacted area of site soils from the ground surface down to the uppermost groundwater zone. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Examples include, without restriction: easements, covenants, deed notices, well drilling or groundwater use prohibitions, zoning restrictions, digging restrictions, orders, building permit conditions, and land-use restrictions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(10) "Point of demonstration wells" means monitoring wells located between the source of site groundwater contamination and the actual or estimated downgradient point of exposure. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(11) "Point of exposure" means the nearest of the following locations: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) The closest existing down gradient drinking water supply well; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) The likely nearest future location of a downgradient drinking water supply well where public supply water is not currently available and is not likely to be made available within the foreseeable future; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) The hypothetical point of drinking water exposure located at a distance of 1000 feet downgradient from the delineated site contamination under this part. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(12) "Proof of financial assurance" means a mechanism, in a form specified by the director, designed to demonstrate that sufficient funds will be available to implement and maintain specific actions or controls. Mechanisms for proof of financial assurance include, but are not limited to, insurance, trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, performance bonds, certificates of deposit, financial tests, and corporate guarantees. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(13) "Receptor" means any human or sensitive organism which is or has the reasonable potential to be adversely affected by the release of constituents of concern. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(14) "Representative concentration" means the average concentration to which a specified receptor is exposed over an exposure duration within a relevant exposure domain for soils or at an established or estimated point of exposure for groundwater and consistent with United States Environmental Protection Agency guidance for determination of average exposure concentration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(15) "Technical impracticability" means the inability to fully delineate or remediate contamination without incremental expenditures disproportionate to the incremental benefit. An example may include, without limitation, dense non-aqueous phase liquids in fractured bedrock settings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(16) "Voluntary remediation program" means the program established under this part. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p10">There is hereby created the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact. The party states recognize and declare that each state is responsible for providing for availability of capacity either within or outside the state for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders, except for waste generated as a result of defense activities of the federal government or federal research and development activities. They also recognize that the management of low-level radioactive waste is handled most efficiently on a regional basis. The party states further recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (P.L. 96-573), has provided for and encouraged the development of low-level radioactive waste compacts as a tool for disposal of such waste. The party states recognize that the safe and efficient management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to dispose of such waste be properly provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10">It is the policy of the party states to: enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste management compact for the purpose of providing the instrument and framework for a cooperative effort; provide sufficient facilities for the proper management of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, promote the health and safety of the region; limit the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive waste generated in the region; encourage the reduction of the amounts of low-level waste generated in the region; distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of successful low-level radioactive waste management equitably among the party states; and ensure the ecological and economical management of low-level radioactive wastes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10">Implicit in the Congressional consent to this Compact is the expectation by the Congress and the party states that the appropriate federal agencies will actively assist the Compact Commission and the individual party states to this Compact by:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10">1. expeditious enforcement of federal rules, regulations, and laws; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">2. imposing sanctions against those found to be in violation of federal rules, regulations, and laws; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial review of air quality permit.</b> - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 7401 et seq., or the state implementation plan controlled or limited CO2 emissions. Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions.

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial review of air quality permit.</b> - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 7401 et seq., or the state implementation plan controlled or limited CO2 emissions. Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions.

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial review of air quality permit.</b> - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 7401 et seq., or the state implementation plan controlled or limited CO2 emissions. Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions. Longleaf Energy Assocs., LLC v. Friends of the Chattahoochee, Inc., 298 Ga. App. 753, 681 S.E.2d 203 (2009), cert. denied, No. S09C1879, 2009 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Judicial review of air quality permit.</b> - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 7401 et seq., or the state implementation plan controlled or limited CO2 emissions. Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions.

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">With respect to the ambient air quality in this state, the General Assembly finds that:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10">(1) Some counties of the state have ambient air levels of ozone or carbon monoxide in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for such pollutants specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 7401, et seq., as amended; and that the USEPA has determined that under certain conditions, such excess levels in such counties are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such counties; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) In order to comply with federal health related air standards in counties where the USEPA has determined that excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles, it is necessary to monitor and limit emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in such counties; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) The USEPA has the duty, by law, to designate those areas of the state violating the NAAQS and has and will, from time to time, as facts dictate, designate those counties or areas of the state violating the NAAQS for ozone and carbon monoxide, and the USEPA has the duty, by law, to establish criteria to determine whether the excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles in such counties; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) With respect to such designations, when counties or areas are designated to have ambient air levels of pollutants in excess of the NAAQS and according to the criteria established by the USEPA the excess levels of pollution are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles, the state is under a duty to provide a plan for reducing the ambient air levels of pollutants found to be in excess of the NAAQS if the state is to maintain its authority to permit new or expanded industry in such county or area; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) Failure of the state to provide a legally enforceable mechanism pursuant to state law for reducing such pollutants in such counties or areas to levels within the NAAQS will result in such a mechanism subsequently being devised by USEPA and enforced in such areas pursuant to federal law and could result in a significant loss of federal funds for sewage treatment plants, transportation projects, and air quality improvement funds; further,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>new or expanded industry which would contribute to the ambient air level of such pollutants would be subject to significant new emission control requirements to offset increased emissions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

The independence of each state and the special needs of subregions are recognized and are to be safeguarded. Accordingly, the cooperation resulting from this Agreement is intended to assist the states in meeting their own problems by enhancing their abilities to recognize and analyze regional opportunities and take account of regional influences in planning and implementing their public policies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

If a study or investigation that would be of primary benefit to a given state, unit of local government, or intrastate or interstate area is proposed, and if the Board finds that it is not justified in undertaking the work for its regional value as a demonstration, the Board may undertake the study or investigation as a special project. In any such event, it shall be a condition precedent that satisfactory financing and personnel arrangements be concluded to assure that the party or parties benefited bear all costs which the Board determines that it would be inequitable for it to assume. Prior to undertaking any study or investigation pursuant to this Article as a special project, the Board shall make reasonable efforts to secure the undertaking of the work by another responsible public or private entity in accordance with the policy set forth in Article IV (b). <br>

For this purpose, all members of the ACF Basin Commission, including the Federal Commissioner, shall have full rights to notice of and participation in all meetings of the ACF Basin Commission and technical committees in which the basis and terms and conditions of the allocation formula are to be discussed or negotiated. When an allocation formula is unanimously approved by the State Commissioners, there shall be an agreement among the states regarding an allocation formula. The allocation formula thus agreed upon shall become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact upon receipt by the Commission of a letter of concurrence with said formula from the Federal Commissioner. If, however, the Federal Commissioner fails to submit a letter of concurrence to the Commission within two hundred ten (210) days after the allocation formula is agreed upon by the State Commissioners, the Federal Commissioner shall within forty-five (45) days thereafter submit to the ACF Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence with the allocation formula setting forth therein specifically and in detail the reasons for nonconcurrence; provided, however, the reasons for nonconcurrence as contained in the letter of nonconcurrence shall be based solely upon federal law. The allocation formula shall also become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact if the Federal Commissioner fails to submit to the ACF Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence in accordance with this Article. Once adopted pursuant to this Article, the allocation formula may only be modified by unanimous decision of the State Commissioners and the concurrence by the Federal Commissioner in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It is the intent of the parties to this Compact, including the United States, to achieve compliance with the allocation formula adopted in accordance with this Article. Accordingly, once an allocation formula is adopted, each and every officer, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall have an obligation and duty, to the maximum extent practicable, to exercise their powers, authority, and discretion in a manner consistent with the allocation formula so long as the exercise of such powers, authority, and discretion is not in conflict with federal law. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The parties to this Compact further agree that any such person may increase the amount of water resources withdrawn, diverted or consumed to satisfy reasonable increases in the demand of such person for water between the effective date of this Compact and the date on which an allocation formula is approved by the ACF Basin Commission as permitted by applicable law. Each of the state parties to this Compact further agree to provide written notice to each of the other parties to this Compact in the event any person increases the withdrawal, diversion or consumption of such water resources by more than 10 million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis, or in the event any person, who was not withdrawing, diverting or consuming any water resources from the ACF Basin as of the effective date of this Compact, seeks to withdraw, divert or consume more than one million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis from such resources.

<p class="p10">(1) Notice of claim shall be filed with the Commission by a voting member of this Compact and served upon each member of the Commission. The notice shall provide a written statement of the claim, including a brief narrative of the relevant matters supporting the claimant's position. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(3) Upon receipt of a claim and any response or responses thereto, the Commission shall convene as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) days from receipt of any response to the claim, and shall determine if a resolution of the dispute is possible. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) A resolution of a dispute under this Article through unanimous vote of the State Commissioners shall be binding upon the state parties and any state party determined to be in violation of the allocation formula shall correct such violation without delay. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) If the Commission is unable to resolve the dispute within 10 days from the date of the meeting convened pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this Article, the Commission shall select, by unanimous decision of the voting members of the Commission, an independent mediator to conduct a non-binding mediation of the dispute. The mediator shall not be a resident or domiciliary of any member state, shall not be an employee or agent of any member of the Commission, shall be a person knowledgeable in water resource management issues, and shall disclose any and all current or prior contractual or other relations to any member of the Commission. The expenses of the mediator shall be paid by the Commission. If the mediator becomes unwilling or unable to serve, the Commission by unanimous decision of the voting members of the Commission, shall appoint another independent mediator. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) If the Commission fails to appoint an independent mediator to conduct a non-binding mediation of the dispute within seventy-five (75) days of the filing of the original claim or within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Commission learns that a mediator is unwilling or unable to serve, the party submitting the claim shall have no further obligation to bring the claim before the Commission and may proceed by pursuing any appropriate remedies, including any and all judicial remedies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) If an independent mediator is selected, the mediator shall establish the time and location for the mediation session or sessions and may request that each party to the Compact submit, in writing, to the mediator a statement of its position regarding the issue or issues in dispute. Such statements shall not be exchanged by the parties except upon the unanimous agreement of the parties to the mediation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) The mediator shall not divulge confidential information disclosed to the mediator by the parties or by witnesses, if any, in the course of the mediation.

The mediator shall not be compelled in any adversary proceeding or judicial forum to divulge the contents of such documents or the fact that such documents exist or to testify in regard to the mediation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(9) Each party to the mediation shall maintain the confidentiality of the information received during the mediation and shall not rely on or introduce in any judicial proceeding as evidence: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">a. Views expressed or suggestions made by another party regarding a settlement of the dispute; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">c. The fact that another party to the hearing had or had not indicated a willingness to accept a proposal for settlement of the dispute. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(10) The mediator may terminate the non-binding mediation session or sessions whenever, in the judgment of the mediator, further efforts to resolve the dispute would not lead to a resolution of the dispute between or among the parties. Any party to the dispute may terminate the mediation process at any time by giving written notification to the mediator and the Commission. If terminated prior to reaching a resolution, the party submitting the original claim to the Commission shall have no further obligation to bring its claim before the Commission and may proceed by pursuing any appropriate remedies, including any and all judicial remedies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(11) The mediator shall have no authority to require the parties to enter into a settlement of any dispute regarding the Compact.

<p class="p10">(13) In the event of a proceeding seeking enforcement of the allocation formula, this Compact creates a cause of action solely for equitable relief.

<p class="p7">EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the intent of the parties to this Compact to develop an allocation formula for equitably apportioning the surface waters of the ACT Basin among the states while protecting the water quality, ecology and biodiversity of the ACT, as provided in the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Sections 1251 et seq., the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. Sections 1532 et seq., the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 4321 et seq., the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. Sections 401 et seq., and other applicable federal laws. For this purpose, all members of the ACT Basin Commission, including the Federal Commissioner, shall have full rights to notice of and participation in all meetings of the ACT Basin Commission and technical committees in which the basis and terms and conditions of the allocation formula are to be discussed or negotiated. When an allocation formula is unanimously approved by the State Commissioners, there shall be an agreement among the states regarding an allocation formula. The allocation formula thus agreed upon shall become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact upon receipt by the Commission of a letter of concurrence with said formula from the Federal Commissioner. If, however, the Federal Commissioner fails to submit a letter of concurrence to the Commission within two hundred ten (210) days after the allocation formula is agreed upon by the State Commissioners, the Federal Commissioner shall within forty-five (45) days thereafter submit to the ACT Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence with the allocation formula setting forth therein specifically and in detail the reasons for nonconcurrence; provided, however, the reasons for nonconcurrence as contained in the letter of nonconcurrence shall be based solely upon federal law. The allocation formula shall also become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact if the Federal Commissioner fails to submit to the ACT Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence in accordance with this Article. Once adopted pursuant to this Article, the allocation formula may only be modified by unanimous decision of the State Commissioners and the concurrence by the Federal Commissioner in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The parties to this Compact recognize that the United States operates certain projects within the ACT Basin that may influence the water resources within the ACT Basin. The parties to this Compact further acknowledge and recognize that various agencies of the United States have responsibilities for administering certain federal laws and exercising certain federal powers that may influence the water resources within the ACT Basin. It is the intent of the parties to this Compact, including the United States, to achieve compliance with the allocation formula adopted in accordance with this Article. Accordingly, once an allocation formula is adopted, each and every officer, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall have an obligation and duty, to the maximum extent practicable, to exercise their powers, authority, and discretion in a manner consistent with the allocation formula so long as the exercise of such powers, authority, and discretion is not in conflict with federal law. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Between the effective date of this Compact and the approval of the allocation formula under this Article, the signatories to this Compact agree that any person who is withdrawing, diverting, or consuming water resources of the ACT Basin as of the effective date of this Compact, may continue to withdraw, divert or consume such water resources in accordance with the laws of the state where such person resides or does business and in accordance with applicable federal laws. The parties to this Compact further agree that any such person may increase the amount of water resources withdrawn, diverted or consumed to satisfy reasonable increases in the demand of such person for water between the effective date of this Compact and the date on which an allocation formula is approved by the ACT Basin Commission as permitted by applicable law. Each of the state parties to this Compact further agree to provide written notice to each of the other parties to this Compact in the event any person increases the withdrawal, diversion or consumption of such water resources by more than 10 million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis, or in the event any person, who was not withdrawing, diverting or consuming any water resources from the ACT Basin as of the effective date of this Compact, seeks to withdraw, divert or consume more than one million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis from such resources. This Article shall not be construed as granting any permanent, vested or perpetual rights to the amounts of water used between January 3, 1992 and the date on which the Commission adopts an allocation formula. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the owner, operator, licensor, permitting authority or regulator of a water resource facility under its jurisdiction, each state shall be responsible for using its best efforts to achieve compliance with the allocation formula adopted pursuant to this Article. Each such state agrees to take such actions as may be necessary to achieve compliance with the allocation formula. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This Compact shall not commit any state to agree to any data generated by any study or commit any state to any allocation formula not acceptable to such state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">(2) The United States Congress enacts a law expressly repealing this Compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) The States of Alabama and Georgia fail to agree on an equitable apportionment of the surface waters of the ACT as provided in Article VII(a) of this Compact by December 31, 1998, unless the voting members of the ACT Basin Commission unanimously agree to extend this deadline. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) The Federal Commissioner submits to the Commission a letter of nonconcurrence in the initial allocation formula in accordance with Article VII(a) of the Compact, unless the voting members of the ACT Basin Commission unanimously agree to allow a single 45 day period in which the non-voting Federal Commissioner and the voting State Commissioners may renegotiate an allocation formula and the Federal Commissioner withdraws the letter of nonconcurrence upon completion of this renegotiation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Compact is terminated in accordance with this Article it shall be of no further force and effect and shall not be the subject of any proceeding for the enforcement thereof in any federal or state court.
