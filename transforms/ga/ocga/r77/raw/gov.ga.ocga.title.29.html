<p class="p4"><b>Persons dealing with guardian should examine guardian's authority.</b> - A guardian is in effect a special agent of the law to manage the estate of a person non sui juris, and it is incumbent upon all persons dealing with the guardian to examine the guardian's authority. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 180 Ga. 4, 177 S.E. 803 (1934) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian cannot use funds to pay third party's debt.</b> - Guardian cannot, with or without court order, use minor ward's funds to pay third party's debt; nor is the guardian authorized without such an order to invest the funds of the ward in bonds issued by a private corporation. Where the guardian attempts to do either, and tenders to the opposite party in the transaction, as payee, a check bearing the signature of the ward by the guardian, these facts without more are sufficient to put the payee on inquiry as to the validity of the transaction. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 180 Ga. 4, 177 S.E. 803 (1934) (decided under former law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2571, and former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 49-101 and 49-603, as it read prior to revision by Ga. L. 1980, p. 1661, <span class="s1">§</span> 1, are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Definition of "guardian of the person."</b> - A guardian of the person is defined to be one who has been lawfully invested with the care of the person of an infant whose natural guardian is dead, and is considered as standing in the place of the natural guardian. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of "natural guardianship."</b> - Natural guardianship, pure and simple, is of the person only, and is incident to the relation of parent. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Circumstances under which probate judge has power to appoint guardian.</b> - The ordinary (now probate judge) is without power to appoint a guardian for the person or for the property of a child unless the child has no guardian as to the one or the other of these things for which the guardianship is asked. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>There cannot be two guardianships at same time</b> as to either person or property of infant, though one person may be guardian of infant's person and another may be guardian of infant's property. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mother is natural guardian automatically.</b> - Ordinary (now probate judge) has nothing to do with constituting mother natural guardian; the mother is natural guardian by operation of law, and without any action whatever by the ordinary (now probate judge) - no appointment, no letters of guardianship are contemplated and nothing is said of any authority of the ordinary (now probate judge) to displace the parent as guardian of the person. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment limited to guardianship of property where natural guardian.</b> - For a minor having no guardian, the ordinary (now probate judge) may appoint a guardian of person and property, or of either, but if the minor has a natural guardian, it certainly cannot be said in a broad sense that the person has no guardian; in such case the range of appointment is limited to guardianship of the property, for it is only as to property that there is no guardian. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-101).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian is entitled to possession of ward's effects.</b> - Guardian of person and property of a lunatic is entitled to retain possession and control of ward's effects so long as guardianship continues; and to deprive the guardian of such possession and control before ward is restored to sanity, it is necessary that the guardian's letters be revoked and another guardian appointed. Bonner v. Evans, 89 Ga. 656, 15 S.E. 906 (1892) (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commingling of funds and failure to account is breach.</b> - Deposit of ward's funds to individual account of guardian, and failure to account therefor, is per se breach of the bond. Hawes v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., 54 Ga. App. 776, 189 S.E. 59 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian cannot maintain divorce proceedings.</b> - Suit for divorce instituted by guardian in behalf of one who has been adjudicated insane cannot be maintained in this state; the right to bring and prosecute such an action being strictly personal, and not within authority conferred by law upon a guardian. Phillips v. Phillips, 203 Ga. 106, 45 S.E.2d 621 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proceeding by next friend for waste with proceeding to remove guardian.</b> - If a next friend suing in behalf of a lunatic can maintain an action for waste committed by the guardian, or recover money in the guardian's hands, it can be done only in connection with a proceeding to remove the guardian and revoke guardianship letters. Bonner v. Evans, 89 Ga. 656, 15 S.E. 906 (1892) (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Cannot appoint guardian of person unless natural guardian lost status.</b> - The probate court has no authority to appoint another as guardian of the person of a child with a living natural guardian unless the loss of that status has been ascertained and declared in some regular proceeding authorized by law, after due notice is given. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-2). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When natural mother of illegitimate child showed that she was the child's mother, that her parental rights had not been relinquished or forfeited in some regular proceeding authorized by law, and that she was, therefore, the natural guardian of the child, the probate court was without jurisdiction to appoint someone else as the guardian of the child's person. Whitlock v. Barrett, 158 Ga. App. 100, 279 S.E.2d 244 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Parental rights not relinquished by custody agreement.</b> - Although the petitioner argued the appointment of guardianship was proper because the mother, the natural guardian of the minor children involved, had voluntarily waived her parental rights and consented to the award of guardianship by sworn affidavit, the affidavit clearly conferred only temporary custody, and made no reference to permanent guardianship. Parental rights are not relinquished by an agreement granting mere custody. Hill v. Loren, 187 Ga. App. 71, 369 S.E.2d 260, cert. denied, 187 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Contest for guardianship of person and property of one adjudged incompetent.</b> - Former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2518 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-8) was applicable to a contest for guardianship of the person and property of one who has been adjudged incapable of managing one's estate and therefore liable to have a guardian appointed for that person.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of word "objectionable".</b> - The word "objectionable" in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-107 referred not to moral qualities exclusively but to any position or course of dealing which led to the conclusion that the interest of a person selected was adverse to that of the estate.

<p class="p4">A court has wide discretion in determining whether an applicant was entitled to the absolute preference set forth in former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-8, and it was apparent that "objectionability" in a guardianship dispute was not the same as "parental unfitness," which must generally be shown before a court can interfere with a parent's right to custody over a child. An inquiry into a guardianship applicant's "unobjectionability" may broadly consider the applicant's suitability, habits, responsibility, sense, and morality, as well as the financial interests of the child. A person may be "objectionable," and not entitled to guardianship as a matter of right, even though the objections would not authorize interfering with the person's right to custody of the person's own child.

<p class="p4"><b>Grandparent named as testamentary guardian should prevail.</b> - Where both parents of an infant child are deceased, the father having survived the mother and by will having provided that his mother should be testamentary guardian of the person of such child, and where in a contest between the paternal and the maternal grandmothers of the child it appears that both are fit and proper persons to have custody of the child, the testamentary guardian is entitled to the custody. Shanks v. Ross, 173 Ga. 55, 159 S.E. 700 (1931) (decided under Ga. L. 1922, p. 46, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Child's grandmother was not entitled to the absolute preference</b> provided for in the statute, and custody of the child was properly awarded to the child's aunt and uncle since: (1) the trial court noted that the grandmother had not exhibited good parenting skills in regard to her own children and had led an inappropriate life style in the presence of minors in the past; (2) the court noted that she divorced the children's father when they were young and then had two long term live in relationships while the minor children lived in her house; (3) one of the children went to live with her father for a year when she was 13 because of difficulties in her relationship with her mother and subsequently left home before finishing high school; and (4) the court found that the grandmother had time and again made poor moral decisions and that educational success had not been a priority for her or her children.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Names and addresses of adult children of ward.</b> - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established.

<p class="p4"><b>Mental capacity to petition for appointment of guardian.</b> - A person receiving social security disability benefits based on a mental disability, who had not been adjudicated to be incapacitated, was not disqualified to petition for appointment of a guardian for mother.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction of juvenile court in transferred custody proceeding.</b> - Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the transfer of a father's petition for custody from Gwinnett County, Georgia, to Douglas County, Georgia, because the "complaint for custody" that the father filed in Gwinnett County fairly was read as a petition to modify, vacate, or revoke the permanent guardianship, a petition over which the Juvenile Court of Douglas County had exclusive jurisdiction under the circumstances. In the Interest of M. F., 298 Ga. 138, 780 S.E.2d 291 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian empowered to appoint agent.</b> - Guardian had power to appoint agent to act for guardian during absence in confederate army, and any act of agent within scope of agent's authority would be as valid as that of guardian. Tarpley v. McWhorter, 56 Ga. 410 (1876) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 1838).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Letters of testamentary guardianship.</b> - Superior court erred in granting an aunt and uncle custody of minor children because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petition for custody since a probate court had exclusive jurisdiction to issue and revoke letters of testamentary guardianship, and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-4(b) mandated the issuance of letters of testamentary guardianship to the brother of the children's father without notice and a hearing and without consideration of the children's best interests; equity afforded no valid basis for the superior court's exercise of jurisdiction because the aunt and uncle had an appropriate remedy in the probate court to challenge the testamentary guardianship: a petition for revocation or suspension of the brother's letters of testamentary guardianship. Zinkhan v. Bruce, 305 Ga. App. 510, 699 S.E.2d 833 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Proceeding by next friend for waste with proceeding to remove guardian.</b> - If a next friend suing in behalf of a lunatic can maintain an action for waste committed by the guardian, or recover money in the guardian's hands, it can be done only in connection with a proceeding to remove the guardian and revoke guardianship letters. Bonner v. Evans, 89 Ga. 656, 15 S.E. 906 (1892) (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's fees.</b> - Because a lawyer failed to present any evidence of the value of the lawyer's services at a probate hearing, the trial court was left to determine that value based on its own experience; since the lawyer failed to prove that the contingency agreement with the beneficiaries of an estate provided for a reasonable fee, the trial court was authorized to determine that $15,000 was a reasonable fee.

<p class="p4"><b>Prima facie proof of ownership by estate.</b> - Inventory and appraisement, when properly filed and recorded in the office of the court of ordinary (now probate court), is prima facie proof as to the property owned by the deceased at the time of death, and an estimate of the value thereof. If not a true inventory and appraisal, the burden is upon the removed administrator to prove that it is not correct, and account to the ordinary (now probate judge) for the items which the administrator listed and submitted to the appraisers, and which the administrator verified as correct.

<p class="p4"><b>Annual returns which do not substantially comply</b> with the law are not prima facie proof in favor of the administrator. If they are allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge) and recorded, under the terms of the statute, anyone challenging their correctness must carry the burden of proving their incorrectness. But when the returns are not allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge), the burden is upon the administrator to prove the returns' correctness in a proceeding in the court of ordinary (now probate court) for an accounting and settlement.

While under the law it is the duty of an administrator to file annual returns accompanied by original vouchers, the duty is placed upon the ordinary (now probate court) to examine the returns to determine their correctness and interested parties are given 30 days in which to file objections to the returns.

<p class="p4"><b>Statutes providing for appointment of guardians for minor children.</b> - The general assembly by inclusion of word "minor " at one place and its exclusion at another did not intend that a parent might, by will, appoint a guardian for property of children who had reached their majority. Therefore, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-103 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-3) only provided for appointment of guardians for persons and/or property of minor children.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Citation unnecessary in appointing guardian already appointed testamentary guardian.</b> - In appointing one as guardian of minors, who has already been appointed as testamentary guardian in their father's will, citation, as ordinarily required by law, is unnecessary. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Gilmore, 171 Ga. 894, 157 S.E. 188 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3033).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Custody does not include power to appoint testamentary guardian.</b> - Judgment or decree of divorce which gives custody and education of child of marriage to wife, does not empower her to appoint a testamentary guardian for that child while the father survives. Taylor v. Jeter, 33 Ga. 195, 81 Am. Dec. 202 (1862) (decided under Ga. L. 1851-52, p. 101, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Grandparent named as testamentary guardian should prevail.</b> - When both parents of infant child are deceased, father having survived mother and by will having provided that his mother should be testamentary guardian of the person of such child, and where in contest between paternal and maternal grandmothers of the child it appears that both are fit and proper persons to have custody of the child, the testamentary guardian is entitled to custody.

<p class="p4"><b>When bond required.</b> - Bond and security is required from all general guardians appointed by the ordinary (now judge of probate court) and the ordinary has discretionary power to require additional bond and security when the estate of the ward is enlarged by subsequent acquisition. Huson v. Green, 88 Ga. 722, 16 S.E. 255 (1892) (decided under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 1804).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate court may authorize testamentary guardian to take charge of minor's estate without requiring bond.</b> - Nothing in the law indicates that court of ordinary (now probate court) is without jurisdiction to authorize testamentary guardian to take charge of minor's estate without requiring bond. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Gilmore, 171 Ga. 894, 157 S.E. 188 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3033).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian of the property.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-4 authorized a probate court to appoint a guardian of the property, over the natural guardian's objection, of a minor over the age of 14, whose sole property was a personal injury action. In re Ray, 248 Ga. App. 45, 545 S.E.2d 617 (2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contest for guardianship of person and property of one adjudged incompetent.</b> - Former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2518 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-8) was applicable to a contest for guardianship of the person and property of one who has been adjudged incapable of managing one's estate and therefore liable to have a guardian appointed for that person. Armor v. Moore, 104 Ga. 579, 30 S.E. 821 (1898) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2518).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Nearest relative has absolute right to appointment if unobjectionable.</b> See Kelley v. Kelley, 129 Ga. App. 257, 199 S.E.2d 399 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-107); Abrams v. Daffron, 155 Ga. App. 182, 270 S.E.2d 278 (1980);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-107).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of word "objectionable".</b> - The word "objectionable" in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-107 referred not to moral qualities exclusively but to any position or course of dealing which led to the conclusion that the interest of a person selected was adverse to that of the estate. Kelley v. Kelley, 129 Ga. App. 257, 199 S.E.2d 399 (1973) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-107). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A court has wide discretion in determining whether an applicant was entitled to the absolute preference set forth in former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-8, and it was apparent that "objectionability" in a guardianship dispute was not the same as "parental unfitness," which must generally be shown before a court can interfere with a parent's right to custody over a child. An inquiry into a guardianship applicant's "unobjectionability" may broadly consider the applicant's suitability, habits, responsibility, sense, and morality, as well as the financial interests of the child. A person may be "objectionable," and not entitled to guardianship as a matter of right, even though the objections would not authorize interfering with the person's right to custody of the person's own child. Huval v. Jacobs, 248 Ga. App. 696, 548 S.E.2d 437 (2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-8).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grandparent named as testamentary guardian should prevail.</b> - Where both parents of an infant child are deceased, the father having survived the mother and by will having provided that his mother should be testamentary guardian of the person of such child, and where in a contest between the paternal and the maternal grandmothers of the child it appears that both are fit and proper persons to have custody of the child, the testamentary guardian is entitled to the custody. Shanks v. Ross, 173 Ga. 55, 159 S.E. 700 (1931) (decided under Ga. L. 1922, p. 46, <span class="s1">§</span> 1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Child's grandmother was not entitled to the absolute preference</b> provided for in the statute, and custody of the child was properly awarded to the child's aunt and uncle since: (1) the trial court noted that the grandmother had not exhibited good parenting skills in regard to her own children and had led an inappropriate life style in the presence of minors in the past; (2) the court noted that she divorced the children's father when they were young and then had two long term live in relationships while the minor children lived in her house; (3) one of the children went to live with her father for a year when she was 13 because of difficulties in her relationship with her mother and subsequently left home before finishing high school; and (4) the court found that the grandmother had time and again made poor moral decisions and that educational success had not been a priority for her or her children. Huval v. Jacobs, 248 Ga. App. 696, 548 S.E.2d 437 (2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-8).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Preference of remaindermen is immaterial.</b> - Under the provisions of former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2518 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-4-8), the ward's nearest of kin by blood, if unobjectionable, was, in such a contest, entitled to the appointment; and the preference of remaindermen, to whom the ward's estate may eventually belong was not, in legal contemplation, material. Armor v. Moore, 104 Ga. 579, 30 S.E. 821 (1898) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2518) Johnson v. Kelly, 44 Ga. 485 (1871) See also Chalker v. Thornton, 31 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Second citation unnecessary.</b> - It is not necessary to issue a second citation when the first citation of application for letters of administration is for the appointment of one person even though the court issues letters of administration to an entirely different person, as to whose appointment no previous notice had been given to any one. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Gilmore, 171 Ga. 894, 157 S.E. 188 (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3046).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Moreover, the law raises implication that there could be no better selection for guardianship of property of minors coming from outside sources than that already provided by the father in his own will as to their persons and property devised by the will.

<p class="p4"><b>Guardian cannot maintain divorce proceedings.</b> - Suit for divorce instituted by guardian in behalf of one who has been adjudicated insane cannot be maintained in this state; the right to bring and prosecute such an action being strictly personal, and not within authority conferred by law upon a guardian. Phillips v. Phillips, 203 Ga. 106, 45 S.E.2d 621 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">A probate court clearly has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for a minor.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Names and addresses of adult children of ward.</b> - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established. Johnson v. Jones, 214 Ga. App. 386, 448 S.E.2d 1 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stepchildren are not included in "children."</b> - A ward's stepchildren are not children under the guardianship statute, nor are they next of kin, and because there were individuals in this case related to the ward by blood, who were not notified of the guardianship proceedings, the appointment of the guardian was void. Wilson v. James, 260 Ga. 234, 392 S.E.2d 5 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for petition at trial.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6(a)(3), which required a guardianship petition to be sworn to by at least two petitioners, did not result in a similar requirement that a petitioner present two witnesses in support of the petition at the actual trial.

<p class="p4"><b>Mental capacity for selection of domicile.</b> - Decision granting a father guardianship of an adult autistic son was supported by sufficient evidence based on the son's desire to change domicile to the father's home, the son's desire to engage in more activities while at the father's home, as well as the testimony of the attorney appointed for the son, who indicated that while the son undoubtedly faced certain challenges due to autism, the son was not so mentally impaired to lack capacity to choose Georgia as the son's domicile.

<p class="p8"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2573, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604, as it read prior to its amendment by Ga. L. 1964, p. 499, <span class="s1">§</span> 68, and as it read prior to revision by Ga. L. 1980, p. 1661, <span class="s1">§</span> 1, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6 have been included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requiring notice is to protect public and alleged incompetent.</b> - The object of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604 in requiring notice to relatives was not to confer any right upon them, but was solely for the purpose of protecting public and interest of alleged incompetent. Phillips v. Phillips, 202 Ga. 776, 44 S.E.2d 767 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relations notified are not parties in their own behalf</b> but are notified for benefit of person to be considered and given an opportunity to be heard in that person's behalf. They are not summoned by process; no judgment can be rendered against them merely because of such notice; and there is no provision for taxing costs against them. Slaughter v. Heath, 127 Ga. 747, 57 S.E. 69, 27 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1 (1907) (decided under former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2573).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Names and addresses of adult children of ward.</b> - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established. Johnson v. Jones, 214 Ga. App. 386, 448 S.E.2d 1 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stepchildren are not included in "children."</b> - A ward's stepchildren are not children under the guardianship statute, nor are they next of kin, and because there were individuals in this case related to the ward by blood, who were not notified of the guardianship proceedings, the appointment of the guardian was void. Wilson v. James, 260 Ga. 234, 392 S.E.2d 5 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Third party intervention in probate court proceeding.</b> - Third party is not prohibited from intervention in a probate court guardianship proceeding. Kipp v. Rawson, 193 Ga. App. 532, 388 S.E.2d 409 (1989) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grandson did not have the right to intervene</b> in proceedings by children for the appointment of a guardian for their mother. White v. Heard, 225 Ga. App. 351, 484 S.E.2d 12 (1997) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mental incompetent is entitled to hearing in county of residence.</b> - Where person files application for appointment of guardian of allegedly mentally incompetent state resident, the latter is entitled to have application for guardianship heard in probate court of county of his or her residence. Sorrells v. Sorrells, 247 Ga. 9, 274 S.E.2d 314 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where representative of alleged incompetent files plea to court's jurisdiction on ground that alleged incompetent is resident of another county, the plea should be sustained if it is determined that alleged incompetent is, in fact and in law, a resident of the other county. Sorrells v. Sorrells, 247 Ga. 9, 274 S.E.2d 314 (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirements for petition at trial.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6(a)(3), which required a guardianship petition to be sworn to by at least two petitioners, did not result in a similar requirement that a petitioner present two witnesses in support of the petition at the actual trial. Cummings v. Stanford, 193 Ga. App. 695, 388 S.E.2d 729 (1989) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court where alleged insane person lives may have jurisdiction.</b> - The court of ordinary (now probate court) of county in which alleged insane person is living and who becomes violent and liable to incur personal injury has jurisdiction notwithstanding fact that residence of such alleged insane person may be in some other county in this state. Anderson v. Smith, 76 Ga. App. 171, 45 S.E.2d 282 (1947), disapproved by Sorrells v. Sorrells, 247 Ga. 9, 274 S.E.2d 314 (1981) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Inquiry into capacity to manage own estate is limited.</b> - For the type of examination inquiring into one's capacity to manage own estate, jurisdiction of ordinary (now judge of probate court) is extremely limited, proceedings are summary and must be strictly construed. Milam v. Terrell, 214 Ga. 199, 104 S.E.2d 219 (1958) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604); Boockholdt v. Brown, 224 Ga. 737, 164 S.E.2d 836 (1968); Trapnell v. Smith, 131 Ga. App. 254, 205 S.E.2d 875 (1974) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604);(decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In proceedings brought under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604 to inquire into one's capacity to manage own estate, jurisdiction of courts of ordinary (now probate courts) was extremely limited. Edwards v. Lampkin, 112 Ga. App. 128, 144 S.E.2d 119, aff'd, 221 Ga. 486, 145 S.E.2d 518 (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evaluation required after initial probable cause found.</b> - Probate court, having initially determined that there was probable cause to warrant filing of a petition for guardianship or conservatorship, erred in dismissing the petition without requiring an evaluation of the proposed ward as mandated by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 29-4-11 and 29-5-11; the ward's refusal to speak to the evaluator without counsel present meant the evaluation should have been rescheduled.

L. 2007, p. 133, <span class="s1">§</span> 1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Guardian empowered to appoint agent.</b> - Guardian had power to appoint agent to act for guardian during absence in confederate army, and any act of agent within scope of agent's authority would be as valid as that of guardian. Tarpley v. McWhorter, 56 Ga. 410 (1876) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 1838).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian is entitled to possession of ward's effects.</b> - Guardian of person and property of a lunatic is entitled to retain possession and control of ward's effects so long as guardianship continues; and to deprive the guardian of such possession and control before ward is restored to sanity, it is necessary that the guardian's letters be revoked and another guardian appointed. Bonner v. Evans, 89 Ga. 656, 15 S.E. 906 (1892) (decided under prior law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commingling of funds and failure to account is breach.</b> - Deposit of ward's funds to individual account of guardian, and failure to account therefor, is per se breach of the bond. Hawes v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., 54 Ga. App. 776, 189 S.E. 59 (1936) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian cannot maintain divorce proceedings.</b> - Suit for divorce instituted by guardian in behalf of one who has been adjudicated insane cannot be maintained in this state; the right to bring and prosecute such an action being strictly personal, and not within authority conferred by law upon a guardian. Phillips v. Phillips, 203 Ga. 106, 45 S.E.2d 621 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-603).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

In the absence of any medical or other direct testimony that visitation would have a negative impact on the child, the child's father had the right to visitation with his daughter over the mother's objection.

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to appoint guardian and conservator.</b> - Order granting sons' petition for guardianship and conservatorship of their mother pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 29-4-1 and 29-5-1(a) was proper because the evidence included, inter alia, the testimony of one of the sons as to his personal knowledge regarding his mother's physical problems, her refusal to either relocate or to hire a private care giver, and her failure to pay her bills; the evidence also included a social worker's evaluation which detailed the mother's erratic behavior and her refusal to pay her bills, which the trial court properly considered pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-12(d)(4). In re Cash, 298 Ga. App. 110, 679 S.E.2d 124 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of county conservator upheld.</b> - Seeking to avoid the recovery of Medicaid payments from their mother's estate, when the daughters opted their mother out of Medicaid and planned to sell some of the mother's property, those decisions were properly held to not be in the mother's best interest and supported the appointment of the county conservator in said capacity. Cruver v. Mitchell, 289 Ga. App. 145, 656 S.E.2d 269 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Findings of parent's inability to manage property were supported.</b> - Given a parent's gravely-impaired judgment, which combined with a physical frailty and impaired vision, made the parent vulnerable to exploitation by a new person living with the parent, the probate court properly concluded that the parent lacked sufficient understanding to make significant responsible decisions concerning the management of the parent's property; moreover, because the parent chose not to include the transcript of the evidence in the appellate record, and, as any pre-trial ruling on the parent's capabilities was, after a trial determining the matter, harmless if not moot, the probate court's ruling was upheld. Yetman v. Walsh, 282 Ga. App. 499, 639 S.E.2d 491 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Finding of some evidence of parent's incapacity did not prove undue influence as matter of law.</b> - The fact that a probate court had found some evidence of a parent's incapacity under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6 (repealed) and had appointed a psychologist to evaluate the parent before the parent deeded real property to one of the adult children did not mean that there was undue influence as a matter of law; at that stage of the guardianship proceedings, the incapacity of the parent was an unproven proposition, not a proven fact. Chesser v. Chesser, 284 Ga. App. 381, 643 S.E.2d 764, cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 493 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ward's right to make will.</b> - The appointment of a guardian for adults who are incapacitated does not destroy the ward's right or ability to make a will. Pope v. Fields, 273 Ga. 6, 536 S.E.2d 740 (2000) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-7).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Probate court's jurisdiction to approve the settlement</b> of a malpractice claim and to protect the best interests of the incapacitated ward conferred upon that court the authority to require that the ward's attorneys pay into the registry of court such settlement funds as the attorneys disbursed to themselves, and to hold them in contempt for their refusal to do so. Gnann v. Woodall, 270 Ga. 516, 511 S.E.2d 188 (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-7).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment of conservator proper.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a petition for the appointment of a conservator to manage a ward's property and financial affairs because the Department of Human Services carried the Department's burden of proving under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-1(a) that the ward lacked sufficient capacity to make or communicate significant responsible decisions concerning the management of the ward's property and financial affairs; pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-12(d)(4), the evidence was sufficient for the probate court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the ward was in need of a conservator to protect the ward's assets because the ward suffered from cognitive loss that affected the ward's judgment with respect to financial affairs, and the ward's impaired judgment led the ward to incur significant financial losses as the ward repeatedly fell victim to fraud.

<p class="p4"><b>Requiring notice is to protect public and alleged incompetent.</b> - The object of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604 in requiring notice to relatives was not to confer any right upon them, but was solely for the purpose of protecting public and interest of alleged incompetent. Phillips v. Phillips, 202 Ga. 776, 44 S.E.2d 767 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Relations notified are not parties in their own behalf</b> but are notified for benefit of person to be considered and given an opportunity to be heard in that person's behalf. They are not summoned by process; no judgment can be rendered against them merely because of such notice; and there is no provision for taxing costs against them. Slaughter v. Heath, 127 Ga. 747, 57 S.E. 69, 27 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1 (1907) (decided under former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2573).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Names and addresses of adult children of ward.</b> - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established. Johnson v. Jones, 214 Ga. App. 386, 448 S.E.2d 1 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stepchildren are not included in "children."</b> - A ward's stepchildren are not children under the guardianship statute, nor are they next of kin, and because there were individuals in this case related to the ward by blood, who were not notified of the guardianship proceedings, the appointment of the guardian was void. Wilson v. James, 260 Ga. 234, 392 S.E.2d 5 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Requiring notice is to protect public and alleged incompetent.</b> - The object of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604 in requiring notice to relatives was not to confer any right upon them, but was solely for the purpose of protecting public and interest of alleged incompetent. Phillips v. Phillips, 202 Ga. 776, 44 S.E.2d 767 (1947) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-604).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Names and addresses of adult children of ward.</b> - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established. Johnson v. Jones, 214 Ga. App. 386, 448 S.E.2d 1 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Stepchildren are not included in "children."</b> - A ward's stepchildren are not children under the guardianship statute, nor are they next of kin, and because there were individuals in this case related to the ward by blood, who were not notified of the guardianship proceedings, the appointment of the guardian was void. Wilson v. James, 260 Ga. 234, 392 S.E.2d 5 (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-5-6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Evaluation required after initial probable cause is found.</b> - Probate court, having initially determined that there was probable cause to warrant filing of a petition for guardianship or conservatorship, erred in dismissing the petition without requiring an evaluation of the proposed ward as mandated by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 29-4-11 and 29-5-11; the ward's refusal to speak to the evaluator without counsel present meant the evaluation should have been rescheduled.

L. 2007, p. 133, <span class="s1">§</span> 1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">"(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under Laws 1810, Cobb's 1851 Digest, p. 317, former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 1817, former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 1817, former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2533, former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3052, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233, and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-52 are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Only surety or representative can institute proceeding.</b> - Proceeding under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-52) could be instituted only by surety, or, if surety was dead, by the surety's representative. Great Am. Indem. Co. v. Jeffries, 65 Ga. App. 686, 16 S.E.2d 135 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guardian must be cited before surety can be discharged.</b> - Surety on a guardian's bond can obtain no discharge without a petition and without having an ordinary (now judge of probate court) to cite guardian to appear and show cause against application. DuPont v. Mayo, 56 Ga. 304 (1876) (decided under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 1817).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Two distinct contingencies whereby surety may seek discharge.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3052 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-52), surety on guardian's bond could obtain relief in two distinct contingencies; first, in case of misconduct of guardian in discharge of trust; second, when for any other reason, the surety desires to be relieved. Means v. American Bonding Co., 23 Ga. App. 453, 98 S.E. 399 (1919) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3052). National Sur. Co. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Preremoval misconduct.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-52 did not require the court, based on the guardian's preremoval misconduct, to grant a surety's petition for relief from its obligations under bonds, and thereby discharge the surety from any liability for the guardian's misconduct. Osborne Bonding &amp; Sur. Co. v. Glaze, 230 Ga. App. 895, 497 S.E.2d 612 (1998) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-52).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Acts or omissions pertaining to mismanagement of estate constitute misconduct.</b> - Under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-52) all acts, whether of commission or omission, which pertain to mismanagement of estate by guardian or administrator, constituted misconduct and could authorize discharge of surety. Spradley v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 108 Ga. App. 865, 134 S.E.2d 850 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discharge prevents proceedings against continuing guardian's acts prior to discharge.</b> - Outgoing surety cannot by proceedings instituted subsequent to discharge, interfere with guardian who is continued in outgoing surety's office, in discharge of the surety's duties, because of acts of mismanagement and failure to comply with requirements of law relative to the surety's duties which occurred prior to discharge of first surety. Hooks v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 135 Ga. 396, 69 S.E. 484 (1910) (decided under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 3052).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasons other than official misconduct for which surety might seek discharge.</b> - A guardian's want of personal integrity, lack of business capacity, extravagant or reckless living, indulgence in vicious or immoral habits, criminality, and scores of other things which might be suggested, would certainly afford good reasons for a desire to be relieved as surety. National Sur. Co. v. Morris, 111 Ga. 307, 36 S.E. 690 (1900) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2533); Means v. American Bonding Co., 23 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Surety seeking discharge against continuing guardian is not entitled to accounting.</b> - Surety is not entitled to seek in a petition for discharge an accounting from guardian who, by providing new security, continues in a trust capacity. Spradley v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 108 Ga. App. 865, 134 S.E.2d 850 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Surety need not wait until liable for waste or mismanagement.</b> - Surety not bound to wait until liability for actual waste or mismanagement arises. The surety may reasonably anticipate same and move for relief at that time. National Sur. Co. v. Morris, 111 Ga. 307, 36 S.E. 690 (1900) (decided under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2533).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Surety need not show actual loss by guardian's misconduct.</b> - To state a cause of action for discharge under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233 (former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-52), it was not necessary that surety show actual loss had accrued to estate by reason of official misconduct of the principal, it being sufficient to show that guardian or administrator has refused to comply with the law, thereby raising reasonable apprehension of future loss. Spradley v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 108 Ga. App. 865, 134 S.E.2d 850 (1964) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 49-233).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever any portion of the dividends, interest, or rents payable to a conservator is required by law of the United States or other governmental unit to be withheld by the person paying the same for income tax purposes, the amount withheld shall be deemed to have been collected by the conservator. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
