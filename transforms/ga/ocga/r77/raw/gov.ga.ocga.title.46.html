</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Definition of "private carrier."</b> - A "private carrier" is one who, without being engaged in the business of carrying as a public employment, undertakes to deliver goods in a particular case for hire or reward. McIntyre v. Harrison, 172 Ga. 65, 157 S.E. 499 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Whether person is common carrier or private carrier depends upon facts;</b> and where there is a question whether the carrier is a private or a common carrier, it is to be determined by the facts relating to, first, whether it is public business or employment, and whether the service is to be rendered to all indifferently; and, second, whether one has so held oneself out as so engaged as to make the person liable for a refusal to accept the employment offered. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Taylor, 172 Ga. 100, 157 S.E. 515 (1931); In re Ga. Air, Inc., 345 F. Supp. 636 (N.D. Ga. 1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Public nature of common carrier business.</b> - Whether a person is a common carrier or a private carrier depends upon whether it is public business or employment, and whether the service is to be rendered to all indifferently; and, whether one has so held oneself out as so engaged as to make one liable for refusal to accept the employment offered. McIntyre v. Harrison, 172 Ga. 65, 157 S.E. 499 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier not common carrier merely by inviting employment by all.</b> - Mere fact that carrier invites all and sundry persons to employ the carrier does not render the carrier a common carrier, if the carrier reserves the right of accepting or rejecting their offers of goods for carriage, whether the carrier's vehicles are full or empty, being guided in the carrier's decision by the attractiveness or otherwise of the particular offer, and not by the carrier's ability or inability to carry, having regard to the carrier's other engagements. McIntyre v. Harrison, 172 Ga. 65, 157 S.E. 499 (1931); Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Taylor, 172 Ga. 100, 157 S.E. 515 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Single contract of transportation.</b> - One who contracts to transport goods from one point to another and deliver them in good order and condition, unavoidable accidents only excepted, is not a common carrier, but is responsible on one's own contract as one. Fish v. Chapman &amp; Ross, 2 Ga. 349, 46 Am. Dec. 393 (1847).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Making individual bargains tends to make service private.</b> - If a carrier does not deal with the public indiscriminately as a matter of routine, but in effect makes an individual bargain in each case, this course of business tends to show that the service is upon a private basis. McIntyre v. Harrison, 172 Ga. 65, 157 S.E. 499 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Making individual bargains not conclusive of nature of carrier.</b> - The making of separate contracts is considered in determining whether a person is a private or a public carrier, but is not conclusive, since contracts might be made simply to escape the duties of a common carrier by subterfuge. McIntyre v. Harrison, 172 Ga. 65, 157 S.E. 499 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Common carrier must be entitled to compensation.</b> - To make one a common carrier, one must be entitled, either by the bargain or by implication, to toll or hire. Self v. Dunn &amp; Brown, 42 Ga. 528, 5 Am. R. 544 (1871).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrying goods as common employment.</b> - To make a person a common carrier, a person must exercise it as a common employment; the person must undertake to carry goods for persons generally, and the person must hold oneself out as ready to engage in the transportation of goods for hire as a business, and not as a casual occupation pro hac vice. Fish v. Chapman &amp; Ross, 2 Ga. 349, 46 Am. Dec. 393 (1847).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence that carrier is common carrier.</b> - That one is a common carrier may be evidenced by carrier's own notice, or practically by a series of acts, by one's own habitual continuance in one's line of business. McIntyre v. Harrison, 172 Ga. 65, 157 S.E. 499 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Common carrier bound to use extraordinary diligence.</b> - While a carrier of passengers is not an insurer of the safety of the carrier's passengers in the sense that a common carrier of goods is said to be an insurer of the safety of goods carried, the carrier is bound to exercise extraordinary care and diligence for the safety of the carrier's passengers, and it matters not the kind of conveyance used or the nature of the motive power employed.

<p class="p4"><b>Venue provisions constitutional.</b> - The mandatory venue provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2(c) were not impliedly repealed by the venue provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code, O.C.G.A. Ch. 2, T. 14, and do not violate the equal protection guarantees of the federal constitution. Driskell v. Georgia Power Co., 260 Ga. 488, 397 S.E.2d 285 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of section.</b> - The scheme of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2 is to make the jurisdiction exclusive in the county where the cause of action originates when there is such resident agent, but elective when there is not. Devereux v. Atlanta Ry. &amp; Power Co., 111 Ga. 855, 36 S.E. 939 (1900). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The combined intent of this O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 46-1-2 and 46-2-90 is to provide for the recovery of compensatory and exemplary damages as well as attorney fees for the tortious infliction of property damages upon the owner or possessor of property where the damage is inflicted as the result of a wilful act. Southern Ry. v. Malone Freight Lines, 174 Ga. App. 405, 330 S.E.2d 371 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No distinction made as to how actions begin.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2 makes no distinction as to how actions begin, whether by petition and process or by the levy of an attachment, but refers to "any judgment" in any action against "all railroad * * * companies." Grand Trunk W.R.R. v. Barge, 75 Ga. App. 646, 44 S.E.2d 281 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

App. 6, 137 S.E.2d 696 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Increased venue for actions against railroad corporations.</b> - The only exceptions to the general rule that a railroad corporation must be sued in the county where its principal office is located are contained in Ga.

Atlanta-Asheville Motor Express v. Dooley, 78 Ga. App. 265, 50 S.E.2d 822 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2334 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2) was not applicable to action against railroad company for injuries sustained in foreign state on account of the negligence of the agents and servants of the company in that state. Atlanta, K. &amp; N. Ry. v. Wilson, 116 Ga. 189, 42 S.E. 356 (1902); Reeves v. Southern Ry., 121 Ga. 561, 49 S.E. 674, 70 L.R.A. 573, 2 Ann.

<p class="p4"><b>"Injury to property" defined.</b> - The expression "injury to property" is used, in its broad and general sense, and is broad enough to comprehend a wrongful conversion of property. Crawford v. Crawford, 134 Ga. 114, 67 S.E. 673, 28 L.R.A. (n.s.) 353, 19 Ann. Cas. 932 (1910); Lamb v. Howard, 145 Ga. 847, 90 S.E. 63 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Constructor of plant not "electric company."</b> - A general contracting corporation, engaged in the construction of a tunnel, building a dam and power house, is not an "electric company" within the meaning of Ga. L. 1912, p. 66 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2). Northern Contracting Co. v. Maddux, 144 Ga. 686, 87 S.E. 892 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What constitutes an agent of a railroad.</b> - For service upon a railroad corporation to be effectual by reason of service upon an agent, at the time of the service the person must be its agent. Pennington &amp; Evans v. Douglas, A. &amp; G. Ry., 6 Ga. App. 854, 65 S.E. 1084 (1909), later appeal, 10 Ga. App. 288, 73 S.E. 425 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agent of state not agent of corporation under receivership.</b> - An agent of the state, under a receiver who has possession of the road in consequence of a seizure by the Governor for nonpayment of interest on bonds which the state has endorsed, is not the agent of the corporation. Cherry v. North &amp; S.R.R., 59 Ga. 446 (1877).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Classification of electric companies within meaning of this section.</b> - The fact that electric membership corporations have by the law extended to them privileges and enjoy certain immunities not granted to other corporations does not of itself remove them from the category of electric companies within the definition contained in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1101 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2). Since the act creating such corporation empowers them to do nothing else but generate and transmit electric energy, and to perform functions incidental thereto, they must be classified as a species of electric companies within the meaning of that section.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pleading and Practice</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of pleading in tort action against railroad.</b> - It has been held under former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 3406 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2) that a declaration against a railroad company showing upon its face that the company was duly chartered under the laws of this state, and complaining that it damaged the plaintiffs by constructing a railroad upon their land in the county in which the action was located, showed substantially, though not in accurate form, that the railroad of the company was wholly or partly in that county. East Ga. &amp; F. R.R. v. King, 91 Ga. 519, 17 S.E. 939 (1893); Gilbert v. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking Co., 104 Ga. 412, 30 S.E. 673 (1898).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of pleading in contract action against railroad.</b> - In an action against a railroad company on a contract instituted in a county other than the one where its chief office of business is located, the pleadings should show that the contract was either made or was to be performed in the county where such action was brought. Corley &amp; Dassett v. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking Co., 49 Ga. 626 (1873).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdictional defect is amendable.</b> - Failure to show jurisdiction, is an amendable defect in a petition, and unless such defect is challenged by demurrer (now motion to dismiss), and opportunity given to amend, a dismissal entered for another and different reason will not be upheld because of such omission. Burton v. Wadley S. Ry., 25 Ga. App. 599, 103 S.E. 881 (1920).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relevance of allegations of willful conduct to recovery of exemplary damages.</b> - In an action for damages sustained on account of a violation of a rule of the commission, exemplary damages may be recovered, if it appears that the conduct of the company amounted to a willful violation of law under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2197 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2); and therefore allegations of the petition which, if proved, would throw light on the question as to whether the conduct of the company was willful, should not be stricken as irrelevant and impertinent. Augusta Brokerage Co. v. Central of Ga. Ry., 121 Ga. 48, 48 S.E. 714 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence must show injury occurred in county where action brought.</b> - In actions against railway and electric companies, it is essential, for the rendition of a valid judgment, that it be shown by evidence that the alleged injury occurred in the county in which the action was brought. Georgia Power Co. v. Woodall, 48 Ga. App. 85, 172 S.E. 76 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mandamus by shipper.</b> - A railroad company owes to the public a duty to obey the reasonable tariff rates fixed by the commission, and a shipper, whose shipment has been rejected on the ground that one of the rates of the commission's schedule is, in the opinion of the carrier, too low, has such special interest in the observance by the railroad company of its duty to the public in this regard as that one may compel its performance by mandamus. Southern Ry. v. Atlanta Stove Works, 128 Ga. 207, 57 S.E. 429 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Election of assignee between action in tort or on contract.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2334 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2), it has been held that where the assignee of a bill of lading has the option to sue the carrier either in tort or for a breach of the contract, and elects the former remedy, and the case is dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the election to proceed in tort does not prevent a subsequent action on the contract. Louisville &amp; N.R.R. v. Pferdmenges, Preyer &amp; Co., 8 Ga. App. 81, 68 S.E. 617 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Service of Process</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of service on agent.</b> - Where an action was brought against a railroad company in the county where the injury complained of took place, and the sheriff returned that the sheriff had served a certain person as agent for defendant at the depot in that county, and a second original of the declaration and process also had been served upon the president of the company, such service was sufficient. Mitchell v. Southwestern R.R., 75 Ga. 398 (1885), overruled on other grounds, Woodley v. Coker, 119 Ga. 226, 46 S.E. 89 (1903). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Personal service upon a ticket-agent in charge of a ticket office of a railroad company, and selling tickets and handling passenger business for it is sufficient service. Seaboard Air-Line Ry. v. Browder, 144 Ga. 322, 87 S.E. 6 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of provisions concerning service on domestic and foreign railroads.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1101 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2) provided that if the carrier by rail had no agent in the county where the accident took place, then plaintiff may sue the company in that county and service may be perfected by the issuance of a second original to be served upon said company in the county of its principal office and place of business, if in this state, and if not, on any agent of such company, or suit may be brought in the county of the residence of such company.

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant cannot waive jurisdiction where improper venue in action against railroad.</b> - Where former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1101 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2), relating to venue of actions against railroad companies, was applicable, it was exclusive; an action brought elsewhere than was there provided, was void, and the defendant cannot waive the question of jurisdiction by pleading to the merits. Georgia, A., S. &amp; C. Ry. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., 88 Ga. App. 426, 76 S.E.2d 724 (1953), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 887, 76 S. Ct. 142, 100 L. Ed. 782 (1955).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party not required to bring suit in county where injury occurred.</b> - For the purpose of determining the venue in a suit against a railroad, the language used in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2 is permissive; thus, a party has the option of bringing suit in the county where an injury occurred, rather than being required to bring suit therein. Southern Ry. v. Lawson, 174 Ga. App. 101, 329 S.E.2d 288 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Atlanta-Asheville Motor Express v. Dooley, 78 Ga. App. 265, 50 S.E.2d 822 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If there is an agent of the railroad company in the county where the cause of action arose, jurisdiction of the action in that county is mandatory, but it is elective with the person injured as to whether the person shall bring an action in the county where the cause of action originated or in the county where the company has its principal place of business or the county of its residence, where there is no agent of the defendant railroad company in the county where the cause originated. Atlanta-Asheville Motor Express v. Dooley, 78 Ga. App. 265, 50 S.E.2d 822 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Venue of action where absence of agent in county where tort occurred.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2334 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2) an action against a railway company for a tort may be brought in the county of the residence of the company when it had no agent in the county where the cause of action arose. Georgia S. &amp; F. Ry. v. Pearson, 120 Ga. 284, 47 S.E. 904 (1904); Southwestern R.R. v. Vellines, 14 Ga. App. 674, 82 S.E. 166 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jurisdiction exclusive where agent has residence in county where cause of action originates.</b> - Since the sole jurisdictional fact is the place of the origin of the cause of action, and the statute has not superadded the further fact of the residence of an agent as one requisite to jurisdiction, it must be held that the scheme of the law is to make the jurisdiction exclusive in the county where the cause of action originates when there is such residence, but elective when there is not. United Motor Freight Term. Co. v. Driver, 74 Ga. App. 244, 39 S.E.2d 496 (1946).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provisions jurisdictional in nature and cannot be waived.</b> - Provisions such that "railroad and electric companies shall be sued by anyone whose person or property has been injured . . . for the purpose of recovering damages for such injuries, in the county in which the cause of action originated . . ." are jurisdictional in their nature and cannot be waived. Southern Ry. v. Wooten, 110 Ga. App. 6, 137 S.E.2d 696 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Georgia, A., S. &amp; C. Ry. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., 88 Ga. App. 426, 76 S.E.2d 724 (1953), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 887, 76 S. Ct. 142, 100 L.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proper venue in county of residence of either tort-feasor.</b> - An action against a railroad and another as joint tort-feasors may be brought in the county of the residence of the individual tort-feasor; and, the fact that the individual tort-feasor is the servant of the railroad and the servant's negligence is the only negligence charged against the railroad, will not alter the rule. Southern Ry. v. Wooten, 110 Ga. App. 6, 137 S.E.2d 696 (1964).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Venue of joint and several action against company and another tort-feasor.</b> - A joint and several action can be brought against a railroad company and another tort-feasor, and as against the railroad company and its employee, a conductor or engineer, and the action can be brought in the county where the cause of action originated and service perfected by second original, and this is true even though neither defendant resides or has an agent in that county; the same principle is applicable to an action against a motor common carrier and the driver of its motor vehicle for a tort.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Futile action where court without jurisdiction due to improper venue.</b> - An action against a common carrier by rail for damages on account of an injury sustained by reason of the negligence of the railroad company in the operation of one of its trains would have to be brought in the county where the injury took place, if the company had an agent in that county; otherwise, the action would be futile, the court not having jurisdiction of the case and any judgment therein void.

<p class="p4"><b>Venue of action where continuous tort to passenger.</b> - The county in which the transportation and the alleged injuries commenced is not a wrong venue for an action by a passenger against a carrier who tortiously and continuously failed to provide for the plaintiff's comfort during a journey from a point in this state to a point in another state.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to foreign corporations.</b> - Former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2334 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2) fixing the venue of actions against railroad companies, applied to foreign as well as domestic corporations. Mitchell v. Southern Ry., 118 Ga. 845, 45 S.E. 703 (1903); Bracewell v. Southern Ry., 134 Ga. 537, 68 S.E. 98 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Venue in action against foreign corporation having no residence in this state.</b> - A foreign corporation not operating under a domestic franchise, has no residence in this state, and the action, if brought in this state, must be brought in the county in which the cause of action originated, whether the defendant has an agent in that county or not. Coakley v. Southern Ry., 120 Ga. 960, 48 S.E. 372 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Required procedure where foreign railroad companies involved in actions.</b> - While foreign railroad companies are subject to action by attachment or in personam for any cause of action arising in Georgia and the plaintiff may proceed by attachment and secure a lien on property of said company located in Georgia, the attachment must be returned to and the case tried in a court having jurisdiction of the attachment in the county designated by the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1101 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-1-2), for the trial of such case.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Venue of actions involving foreign motor common carriers.</b> - Foreign motor common carrier, engaged in the business of trucking, hauling and transporting freight over the various public highways within the state, and having designated a resident agent upon whom service of process can be made, under the clear mandate of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 68-619 was, so far as the right to sue was concerned, a resident of this state, and a resident of the county in which the cause of action originated, so far as the right to bring an action against it for a cause of action originating in that county was concerned. Southeastern Truck Lines v. Rann, 214 Ga. 813, 108 S.E.2d 561 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A motor common carrier may be a nonresident corporation, yet since it is engaged in doing business in this state, and has agents in the state for that purpose, it is a resident of this state and a resident of the county in which the cause of action originated, so far as the right to bring an action against it for a cause of action originating in that county is concerned, and, being a resident of that county for the purpose of action, a joint tort-feasor, notwithstanding that the person may reside in another county of this state, may be sued jointly with the motor common carrier in the county in which the cause of action originated.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Circumstances under which action brought in county where cause of action originated.</b> - If the company has no agent in the county in which the cause of action originated, the action may nevertheless be brought in that county, the court having power to perfect service upon the defendant by second original, and such ruling is not contrary to the provisions of the state Constitution that all civil cases, except those enumerated, shall be tried in the county where the defendant resides. Atlanta-Asheville Motor Express v. Dooley, 78 Ga. App. 265, 50 S.E.2d 822 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A foreign corporation operating in this state as a motor common carrier may be sued in the county where the cause of action originated, and service on one designated by the corporation for that purpose may be had by second original; it is not necessary, if such foreign corporation have an agent and a place of business in this state, that the action be brought in that county.

<p class="p4"><b>Residency requirement upheld.</b> - Requiring appellee candidate to reside in the district for 12 months prior to the general election did not deny the candidate equal protection under the United States Constitution or the Georgia Constitution as the residency requirement for election to the Georgia Public Service Commission was rationally related to the state's legitimate interests in fostering informed voters and promoting knowledgeable and responsive candidates with ties to the community, and did not place an unreasonable burden on the right of voters to choose a candidate or the right of the candidate to run for public office.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commission not authorized to determine whether street railroad company may discontinue service.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2663 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-20) the commission had no express or implied power to determine whether a chartered street railroad company may entirely discontinue or abandon service upon a line, or part thereof, voluntarily constructed by it and devoted to the public use. Railroad Comm'n v. Macon Ry. &amp; Light Co., 151 Ga. 256, 106 S.E. 282 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitation of damages for interrupted telephone service proper.</b> - Since the fixing of utility rates is no longer a matter of private contract, but is charged with a public interest, and it is to the public interest to have uninterrupted service at a reasonable price, it necessarily follows that a reasonable limitation of liability for damages for interrupted telephone service may be considered as a part of the telephone rate-making function. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Invenchek, Inc., 130 Ga. App. 798, 204 S.E.2d 457 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Requiring extension of power lines beyond utility's commitment unconstitutional.</b> - Requiring extension of existing power lines beyond scope of carrier's commitment to public service is an unconstitutional taking of property. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Georgia Power Co., 182 Ga. 706, 186 S.E. 839 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commission may investigate contracts impairing utilities public duties.</b> - Commission is authorized to investigate possibility that a contract impairs obligation of a utility to discharge its public duties.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commission not to issue special order without notice and hearing.</b> - Former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2663 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-20) contemplated that notice and an opportunity of a hearing be given and that provision may be made for such notice either by statute or rule of the commission. That section was to be construed to mean that the commission shall not issue a special order in a particular case, directed to a person or corporation, without first giving notice and an opportunity for hearing to the person or corporation so to be affected thereby. Wadley S. Ry. v. State, 137 Ga. 497, 73 S.E. 741 (1912), aff'd, 235 U.S. 651, 35 S. Ct. 214, 59 L. Ed. 405 (1914); City of Atlanta v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts to investigate only unreasonable, arbitrary, or confiscatory commission orders.</b> - Courts should not interfere with valid order of Public Service Commission unless it is clearly shown that the order is unreasonable, arbitrary, or confiscatory; and courts have no power to substitute their judgment for that of the commission. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Georgia Power Co., 182 Ga. 709, 186 S.E. 839 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Commission has no authority to adjudicate contractual disputes between local exchange carriers.</b> - The statute does not grant authority to the Georgia State Public Commission to adjudicate contractual disputes between local exchange carrier. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. MCImetro Access Transmission Servs., 278 F.3d 1223 (11th Cir. 2002), vacated, 297 F.3d 1276 (11th Cir. 2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Power to regulate construction belongs to Commission.</b> - The regulation of the construction of electric power substations by municipalities was preempted based on the authority given to the Public Service Commission under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-20. City of Buford v. Ga. Power Co., 276 Ga. 590, 581 S.E.2d 16 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) had the authority to regulate the placement of electrical substations, no requirement existed that every complex construction project be subject to zoning-like restrictions as an agency was not required to exercise the agency's zoning power under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-66-2(a); the broad statutory delegations of authority to the PSC did not specifically mention siting and did not provide sufficient objective standards to control the PSC's discretion so a trial court improperly directed the PSC to consider the propriety of a power company's construction of a substation and apply specific standards to the case.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commission may fix different rates for classes of customers.</b> - Since the Public Service Commission has by statute authority to fix just and reasonable gas rates to be paid by consumers, it has the power to make classifications which are reasonable, and to fix a different rate for each class of consumers; and where such rates are attacked in the courts, there is a presumption that they are valid, and the burden is on the attacking party to show that the same are invalid in that they are unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory. Carmichael v. Atlanta Gaslight Co., 185 Ga. 34, 193 S.E. 896 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Matters to be considered in rate-making.</b> - What is just and reasonable to be charged, what is actuarially sound, what limitations of liability are necessary to reach this result, are matters which need to be taken into account in the determination of public utility rates, just as there are proper actuarial considerations in fixing insurance premiums. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Invenchek, Inc., 130 Ga. App. 798, 204 S.E.2d 457 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts have no power to make rates.</b> - Making and controlling utility rates is a legislative function delegated to a quasi-legislative body and the courts have no power to control and make such rates. DeKalb County v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 358 F. Supp. 498 (N.D. Ga. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 700 (5th Cir. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Administrative remedies must be exhausted before court may exercise jurisdiction.</b> - Where plaintiff fails to utilize the administrative remedies available for investigations and hearings (see O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 2, T. 46), a court lacked jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of a public utility's rate structure. Norman v. United Cities Gas Co., 231 Ga. 788, 204 S.E.2d 127 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court lacked jurisdiction to hear utility company's appeal from an interim order.</b> - Trial court erred by affirming a decision of the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) in a ratemaking appeal filed by a gas distribution company and by denying the PSC's motion to dismiss the company's appeal; the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the company's petition for judicial review since one order appealed from was an interim order, and not a final order, and a voice note appealed from was not even a decision subject to review.

<p class="p4"><b>Maximum rates fixed by commission presumptively reasonable.</b> - Where the legislature confers upon the commission the power to fix maximum rates for service rendered to the public by individuals or corporations engaged in a public service, the maximum rates fixed by the commission are presumptively reasonable, and public service companies may demand such maximum rates.

<p class="p4"><b>Unreasonable, arbitrary, or confiscatory commission orders within court's scope.</b> - Courts should not interfere with valid order of Public Service Commission unless it is clearly shown that the order is unreasonable, arbitrary, or confiscatory; and courts have no power to substitute their judgment for that of the commission.

<p class="p4"><b>Administrative remedies must be exhausted before court may exercise jurisdiction.</b> - Where plaintiff fails to utilize the administrative remedies available (see O.C.G.A.

<p class="p4"><b>Legislature's power to regulate.</b> - The grant of authority to regulate public utilities to the Public Service Commission, to the exclusion of other executive branch agencies, does not mean that the General Assembly has divested itself of its constitutional power to regulate public utilities. Lasseter v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 253 Ga. 227, 319 S.E.2d 824 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Review of commission order lowering electric rates.</b> - Order of Public Service Commission lowering rates charged for electricity is quasi-legislative in character, and writ of certiorari will not lie from the superior court to review such an order. Mutual Light &amp; Water Co. v. City of Brunswick, 158 Ga. 677, 124 S.E. 178 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agency decision supported by facts.</b> - Where the Public Service Commission granted a rate increase, but disallowed some of the utility company's costs in calculating the rate base for a fair increase because it concluded that some of the costs were the result of the company's imprudent management of the project, the agency's decision was within its authority and was supported by the facts.

<p class="p4">As O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-23(a) authorized the Georgia Public Service Commission to determine "just and reasonable" rates for electric service, and the evidence formed a sufficient basis for the Commission's decision to reallocate franchise fees paid to municipalities in exchange for access to municipal roads and rights-of-way so as to reduce the burden on non-municipal customers, the Commission's decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.

Taffet v. Southern Co., 967 F.2d 1483 (11th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1021, 113 S. Ct. 657, 121 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consumer cannot establish own rate.</b> - Since the legislature has provided by law that the Public Service Commission shall establish the legal rate for a utility's services, although a consumer of a utility's services has the right to participate in the rate-setting process within the parameters set up by this legislature, the consumer has no legal right to pay any rate other than the one established by the Public Service Commission. Taffet v. Southern Co., 967 F.2d 1483 (11th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1021, 113 S. Ct. 657, 121 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">In a putative class action against the power company regarding the collection of municipal franchise fees, the plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing their putative class action because the plaintiffs did not seek judicial relief from the Public Service Commission's orders; the plaintiffs did not dispute that the Commission could authorize the collection of those fees; the merits of the case were not committed by law to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission; and the putative class action would not infringe upon the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction to make just and reasonable rates for electrical service.

Pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the commission, upon filing with such schedule and delivering to the utility affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a period longer than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect, provided that the commission may apply to the Superior Court of Fulton County for an extension of such period, as provided for in Code Section 46-2-57.

If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order not made at the expiration of the suspension period, the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service shall go into effect at the end of such period; but in case of a proposed increased rate or charge, the commission shall by order require the interested utility to keep accurate account in detail of all amounts received by reason of such increase, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts were paid; and upon completion of the hearing and the rendering of a decision, the commission shall by further order require such utility to refund, with interest at the maximum legal rate, in such manner as the commission may direct, such portion of such increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified.

<p class="p4"><b>Effect of 1976 amendment to section.</b> - The 1976 amendment to former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 93-307.1 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25), which added subsection (d), was a recognition by the legislature that section prior to amendment did not prohibit the effectuating of rates according to the date of billing, which would therefore cover some electricity used prior to the date of the effectuating order. Moore v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 242 Ga. 182, 249 S.E.2d 549 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with other statutes.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25 supercedes contrary provisions of the Georgia Administrative Procedure Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-13-17, with regard to the judicial review of decisions made by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Atmos Energy Corp. v. Ga. PSC, 290 Ga. App. 243, 659 S.E.2d 385 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Entitlement to lower rate must be shown to challenge increase on constitutional grounds.</b> - Utility customers must show they have a legal entitlement to or a vested right in the utility rates being charged before any proposed increase, before they can claim any property rights protected by the United States Constitution. Georgia Power Project v. Georgia Power Co., 409 F. Supp. 332 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Utility customers have no vested rights in fixed utility rates.</b> Georgia Power Project v. Georgia Power Co., 409 F. Supp. 332 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Utility customers have no property interest in rate increases.</b> - Utility customers have no sufficient property interest in given utility rate increase to invoke procedural protections of due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. 14. Georgia Power Project v. Georgia Power Co., 409 F. Supp. 332 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Collective ratemaking activities carried on by "rate bureaus" immune from antitrust liability.</b> - Collective ratemaking activities carried on by "rate bureaus" composed of motor common carriers operate in several states, although not compelled by the states involved, "clearly articulated state policy" and thus were immune from antitrust liability. Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery of costs of demand-side programs.</b> - The commission had authority under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3A-9 to allow a utility to recover the costs of demand-side energy conservation programs and interruptible service credits through riders or surcharges outside of a general rate case and the test year statute. Georgia Power Co. v. Georgia Indus. Group, 214 Ga. App. 196, 447 S.E.2d 118 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Order addressing disposition of overearnings authorized.</b> - Neither the Public Service Commission's determination that Tier 2 local exchange companies' return on equity earnings exceeded that authorized, nor its order for the application of over-earnings to reduce intrastate access rates violated either subsection (d) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25, which prohibits rate-making orders with retroactive effect, or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-5-166(f)(2), regarding adjustments to intrastate access rates.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What constitutes a rate case.</b> - A hearing before the commission to consider a utility's proposed alternate rate plan that did not recommend or request any rate changes for customers did not constitute a rate case requiring a full hearing. Georgia Public Serv. Comm'n v. Campaign for a Prosperous Ga., 229 Ga. App. 28, 492 S.E.2d 916 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficiency of findings of fact.</b> - Where the Public Service Commission granted a rate increase, but disallowed some of the utility company's costs in calculating the rate base for a fair increase because it concluded that some of the costs were the result of the company's imprudent management of the project, the agency's decision was within its authority, and was supported by the facts. Georgia Power Co. v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 196 Ga. App. 572, 396 S.E.2d 562 (1990), cert. denied, 196 Ga. App. 908, 396 S.E.2d 562 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court lacked jurisdiction to hear utility company's ratemaking appeal from an interim order.</b> - Trial court erred by affirming a decision of the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) in a ratemaking appeal filed by a gas distribution company and by denying the PSC's motion to dismiss the company's appeal; the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the company's petition for judicial review since one order appealed from was an interim order, and not a final order, and a voice note appealed from was not even a decision subject to review. Atmos Energy Corp. v. Ga. PSC, 290 Ga. App. 243, 659 S.E.2d 385 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Natural gas distribution company could not challenge a rate change ruling by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) because the order was not a final order under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25(d) as the language indicated that it was only an interim decision; <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25 did not mandate the entry of a final order at the end of the six-month "file and suspend" period, and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-13-17(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act did not prevail over the more restrictive requirements imposed by <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25(d) as to the manner in which the PSC rendered a decision. Atmos Energy Corp. v. Ga. PSC, 285 Ga. 133, 674 S.E.2d 312 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutional challenges to statute could not be considered on appeal.</b> - Taxpayers constitutional challenges to the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25(c.1), could not be considered on appeal because the trial court declined to reach the merits of the constitutional challenges and merely ruled that the taxpayers lacked standing to raise the claims; because the taxpayers neither enumerated as error the ruling of the trial court that the taxpayers lacked standing to raise a constitutional challenge to <span class="s1">§</span> 46-2-25(c.1) nor provided any argument or citation of authority with respect to that ruling, it was not made an issue in the appeal and would not be considered.

Such determination shall consider the availability of funds and other revenue sources to affected companies to offset the costs associated with such toll-free calling areas. It shall be within the discretion of the Public Service Commission to determine the methodology and source of recovery for any such affected telephone company.

<p class="p4">In a putative class action against the power company regarding the collection of municipal franchise fees, the plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing the plaintiffs' putative class action because the plaintiffs did not seek judicial relief from the Public Service Commission's orders; the plaintiffs did not dispute that the Commission could authorize the collection of those fees; the merits of the case were not committed by law to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission; and the putative class action would not infringe upon the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction to make just and reasonable rates for electrical service.

In each such proceeding, the commission shall maintain a record as provided in paragraph (8) of subsection (a) of Code Section 50-13-13 including all pleadings, a transcript of proceedings, a statement of each matter of which the commission takes official notice, and all staff memoranda or data submitted to the commission in connection with its consideration of the case.

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">After March 29, 1973, and continuing thereafter as rapidly as it is administratively practicable to do so, the commission is authorized and directed to assign to electric suppliers or to declare as unassigned areas-B all geographic areas in this state that were, on March 29, 1973, located outside the corporate limits of any municipality. Such assignments and declarations of unassignment shall be effected by the commission in accordance with the following standards:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10">(1) Assigned areas shall be described by defined boundaries on maps to be filed with the commission and incorporated by it in its orders. Where deemed necessary or appropriate, the commission may require boundaries to be additionally described by written metes and bounds; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Each geographic area assigned shall be assigned to only one electric supplier, as determined by public convenience and necessity, having primary regard for the location of electric suppliers' lines but having no regard for differences in electric suppliers' retail rates or for the fact that retail consumers are not then being served from such lines; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Each geographic area assigned shall be so assigned that its boundaries enclose land spaces in which the assignee electric supplier owns all or a preponderance of the lines, provided that a geographic area may be so assigned or declared unassigned even though it is completely surrounded by the inner boundaries of another geographic area assigned to an electric supplier. Boundaries will be located around the perimeter of such land spaces so as to be approximately 1,000 feet from the nearest of the assignee electric supplier's lines so enclosed, provided that if the lines of two or more electric suppliers are closer together than 2,000 feet, the boundary shall be located approximately halfway between them; provided, however, that where compelling factors of public convenience and necessity so require, including the need for using natural and manmade landmarks for boundary references, the location of a boundary may vary somewhat more or somewhat less than such 1,000 foot or halfway distance; provided, further, that such 1,000 foot or halfway distance standards shall not apply to any lines of the assignee electric supplier which extend from inside the assigned area outside such area or to any lines of any other electric supplier which extend from outside the area inside or completely across such area and which do not otherwise occasion assignment or unassignment of land space, the rights and restrictions applying to such other electric supplier's lines inside such area being as provided for in paragraph (4) of this Code section; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) A line of an electric supplier which extends into or completely crosses a land space in which another electric supplier owns a preponderance of the lines may nevertheless be considered as the basis for assigning or declaring unassigned land space related thereto; but, unless such line so occasions an assignment or an unassignment, then, from and after the date of the assignment to an electric supplier of the geographic area within which such line is enclosed and based upon the location of both suppliers' lines on that date, the electric supplier owning such enclosed line shall have the exclusive right to extend and continue furnishing service to all new premises locating at least partially within 500 feet of such line and wholly more than 500 feet from the assignee electric supplier's lines and shall have the right, if chosen by the consumer utilizing such premises, to extend and continue furnishing service to new premises locating at least partially within 500 feet of both electric suppliers' lines but shall not otherwise have the right, unless so agreed by the assignee electric supplier and the consumer utilizing such premises, to extend and furnish service to any other premises locating inside such assigned area; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) Except where public convenience and necessity require their assignment, the commission shall declare as unassigned areas-B those land spaces which are not assigned to an electric supplier pursuant to any other provision of this part; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Not inconsistent with Code Section 46-3-8, any electric supplier may apply to the commission for assignment to it of one or more geographic areas or for the commission to declare one or more geographic areas to be unassigned areas-B.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">Whenever, after March 29, 1973, any geographic area is annexed to a municipality including the inclusion of a geographic area in a new municipality formed by the merger, consolidation, or any other combination of a then existing municipality and one or more other geographically defined political subdivisions, if the resulting political subdivision constitutes a municipality as defined in Code Section 46-3-3, such geographic area shall be assigned or assignable or become unassigned, and the rights and restrictions applying to electric suppliers therein shall be as follows:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p10">(1) In so much of such geographic area, if any, as was immediately theretofore within the limits of a municipality as they existed on March 29, 1973, or as they existed on the date on which a wholly new municipality came into existence, and if such annexation is caused by the merger, consolidation, or any other combination of such previously existing municipality and one or more other geographically defined political subdivisions, resulting in a political subdivision which constitutes a municipality as defined in Code Section 46-3-3, the rights and restrictions applying to all electric suppliers therein shall continue to be governed by Code Section 46-3-5 or 46-3-6, whichever is applicable; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) As to such geographic areas other than those provided for in paragraph (1) of this Code section: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) So much of such geographic area, if any, as was already assigned to a primary supplier within a municipality which was in existence on March 29, 1973, shall continue to be so assigned, provided that if such annexation is caused by the merger, consolidation, or any other combination of two or more such municipalities having different primary suppliers, such assignments shall continue in favor of such primary suppliers respectively; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) If the annexation is to a wholly new municipality, then so much of such geographic area, if any, as was already assigned to an electric supplier then serving as an assignee electric supplier within such municipality shall continue to be so assigned; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) If such annexation includes one or more wholly new municipalities or one or more municipalities which were in existence on March 29, 1973, then so much of such geographic area, if any, as was then contiguous to a wholly new municipality and was already assigned to an assignee electric supplier within such wholly new municipality, or which was contiguous to a municipality which was in existence on March 29, 1973, and was already assigned to the primary supplier within such municipality, shall continue to be so assigned; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) As to such geographic areas which are annexed by other than merger, consolidation, or other combination of a previously existing municipality and one or more other geographically defined political subdivisions so as to result in a political subdivision which constitutes a municipality as defined in Code Section 46-3-3 but are not provided for in paragraph (1) of this Code section or in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, so much of such geographic area, if any, as was already assigned to any electric supplier shall continue to be so assigned. In the event the primary supplier delivers, not less than 45 nor more than 90 days prior to the effective date of such annexation, written notice of such annexation upon every other electric supplier owning lines within the county or counties in which the annexing municipality is located (or, though not in the same county, within one mile of any portion of such geographic area), such portions of such geographic area as shall not have been already assigned to any other electric supplier shall by operation of this part become assigned to the primary supplier unless, on or before the effective date of such annexation, there is filed with the commission one or more applications by one or more other electric suppliers for the assignment of any portion of such geographic area. If such an application or applications are filed, then, until there is a final determination with respect to such application or applications, the service rights and restrictions applying to electric suppliers in so much of such geographic area as is the subject matter of the application or applications shall continue as they were immediately prior to the effective date of annexation. In such a proceeding, the commission, acting in accordance with Code Section 46-3-4, may make assignments of all or any portion of such geographic area to one or more applicant electric suppliers. Any portion of such geographic area not so assigned to any other electric supplier shall, effective as of the final determination of such application or applications, be assigned by operation of this part to the primary supplier, provided that if the commission finds and determines upon complaint that such assignment to the primary supplier of any such portion thereof will be grossly inimical to the public interest, it shall designate such portion as an unassigned area-B. In any geographic area assigned by operation of this part pursuant to this subparagraph, every secondary supplier shall have, based upon the location of all secondary suppliers' lines therein on the effective date of the annexation, the exclusive right to extend and continue furnishing service to new premises locating therein at least partially within 300 feet of its line and wholly more than 300 feet from the lines of every other electric supplier; and shall have the right, if chosen by the consumer utilizing such premises, to extend and continue furnishing service to new premises locating therein at least partially within 300 feet of both its lines and the lines of any other electric supplier; but shall not otherwise have the right, unless so agreed by the assignee electric supplier and by any other secondary supplier whose lines are located at least partially within 300 feet thereof and the consumer utilizing such premises, to extend and continue furnishing service to any other premises locating therein, which shall be the exclusive right of the assignee electric supplier or such other secondary supplier, if such be the case; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) If such geographic area was already an unassigned area-A or an unassigned area-B and was annexed by merger, consolidation or other combination of a previously existing municipality and one or more other geographically defined political subdivisions so as to result in a political subdivision which constitutes a municipality as defined in Code Section 46-3-3, or if such an unassigned area-A or unassigned area-B was otherwise annexed but the notice of annexation required by subparagraph (D) of this paragraph was not given, such geographic area shall, on the effective date of the annexation, become or continue to be, as the case may be, an unassigned area-B until and unless the commission assigns all or any portion thereof to an electric supplier pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of Code Section 46-3-8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Lack of notice of risk to power company insignificant where lines negligently installed or maintained.</b> - One whose injury is caused by negligent installation or maintenance of high-voltage lines, even where such injury occurs while engaged in acts enumerated in former Code section 46-3-32 within eight (now ten) feet of the lines, is not barred by failure to give notice. Malvarez v. Georgia Power Co., 250 Ga. 568, 300 S.E.2d 145 (1983), superceded by statute as stated in Williams v. Mitchell County Elec. Mbrshp.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to give notice allowed power company to maintain indemnity action against employer.</b> - Purpose of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-40(b), allowing a power company to pursue an indemnity action against an employer whose workers were injured by contact with high voltage power lines because the workers failed to notify the power company of the work, was to prevent injury, a legitimate legislative purpose, and the purpose was served because the threat of an indemnity action would motivate employers to follow the notice requirement and thereby prevent accidents.

<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of section.</b> - Ga. L. 1960, p. 181, <span class="s1">§</span> 5 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-34) means that for a construction work risk to be brought within the duty owed by the owner and maintainer of the high-voltage lines, then the notice required by that section must have been given by the responsible party. Carden v. Georgia Power Co., 231 Ga. 406, 202 S.E.2d 55 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction.</b> - There is no doubt engendered by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-34 about the necessity of giving notice prior to working in proximity to high-voltage power lines or about the effect of failing to give notice. Thus, persons of common intelligence need not guess at the meaning of that section, and, once in the possession of the necessary facts, should not differ as to its application. Santana v. Georgia Power Co., 269 Ga. 127, 498 S.E.2d 521 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Duty where notice of work risk given.</b> - Ga. L. 1960, p. 181, <span class="s1">§</span> 5 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-34) places duty upon owner and maintainer of high-voltage lines where notice is given of a construction work risk although such owner would otherwise not be liable. Carden v. Georgia Power Co., 231 Ga. 406, 202 S.E.2d 55 (1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The phrase "person responsible for the work to be done" is defined in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-30(2) and, when read in conjunction with subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-34, requires the person or persons immediately responsible for the operation of machinery within eight feet of a high-voltage line to give notice. Green v. Moreland, 200 Ga. App. 167, 407 S.E.2d 119 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Activities of employee not constituting contributory negligence.</b> - A mere employee of a construction company, not having notification responsibility under Ga. L. 1960, p. 181, <span class="s1">§</span> 5 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-34), cannot be contributorily negligent as a matter of law just because the employee performed activities within the prohibited eight feet from high-voltage lines.

<p class="p4">Assumption of the risk did not apply as a defense to a farm worker's death by electrocution since there was no evidence to show that the farm worker appreciated the danger of the sagging power lines; despite the fact that the power company failed to maintain or inspect its power lines, it was immune from liability since it had no notice that the deceased was working within 10 feet of its lines. Williams v. Mitchell County Elec. Mbrshp. Corp., 255 Ga. App. 668, 566 S.E.2d 356 (2002), aff'd, 276 Ga. 759, 582 S.E.2d 107 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a suit by employees of a subcontractor who were electrocuted while working on a construction project, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to a power company based on lack of notice required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-34.

<p class="p4"><b>Where energy used is irrelevant.</b> - Since the intent of the General Assembly is to authorize operators of cogeneration facilities to manufacture energy as necessary to meet their needs and to authorize the operators to sell any excess electrical energy to other electric utilities, it appears clear that the phrase "at such cogeneration facility" modifies the word "produced" and not the term "uses." Therefore, so long as the operator of the cogeneration facility uses all of the useful energy produced at the cogeneration facility with the exception of any excess electrical energy which is sold in accordance with the act, it is irrelevant where the energy is used. 1988 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Power of authority to function and contract as state instrumentality.</b> - The Municipal Electric Authority has authority to function and contract as instrumentality of the state in providing electric power to the political subdivisions of the state which own and operate electric distribution systems, and to contract with power companies, electric membership corporations, and political subdivisions for the purchase, ownership, operation, and maintenance of the facilities which constitute the subject matter of the contracts.

<p class="p4"><b>Immunity from antitrust laws.</b> - The Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) is an "instrumentality of the state" as are its participants, political subdivisions who entered long-term power supply agreements, and is therefore immune from the antitrust laws under the state action immunity doctrine broadened by the Supreme Court in Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985) and Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985).

<p class="p4"><b>Fact that property used as resort does not prevent owner from becoming member.</b> - The fact that an applicant's property is used for a fishing camp or pleasure resort, and not as a farm home, permanent dwelling, or place of business, does not prevent the applicant becoming a member of the corporation and receiving electric service, or the corporation from furnishing electric energy to the applicant.

O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-204 governed the acquisition of rights of way and did not apply to noise pollution claims, and the evidence as to whether the noise and vibrations from the plant were abatable nuisances or permanent nuisances was in sharp conflict.

<p class="p4"><b>Application to "all rights of action".</b> - Trial court correctly concluded that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-3-204 applied to the class member claims. The class was defined to include owners of land onto which the electric company unlawfully entered to erect structures; thus, the developer and other potential class members could not avoid the limiting language of the Code section by seeking equitable relief in the form of deed reformation because the Code section applied to "all rights of action."

<p class="p4"><b>Claims were not time-barred.</b> - Property owners' claims against a utility were not time-barred because the owners filed suit within two months of the utility's alleged trespass and conversion as the destruction of more vegetation by the utility, which had previously clear cut trees on the owners' property, was new. Given the evidence that a utility representative disclaimed any easement or other right to enter the property again after the first incident, the second entry could not be deemed as a matter of law to be part of a continuing trespass.

<p class="p4"><b>Claims were time-barred.</b> - Property owners' argument that a utility defrauded the owners by claiming that the utility had no easement and no plan to enter the owners' property again did not toll the owners' claims relating to the entry of the owners' property because the trespass was completed and would not recur, and no matter what, the utility could not put back the trees and vegetation the utility had clear-cut, so the conversion was complete. There was no allegation, much less evidence, that the utility misled the owners as to a damages action. Daniel v. Amicalola Elec. Mbrshp.

<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly finds that electric membership corporations providing broadband services should be permitted to use existing electric easements to provide or expand access to broadband services. The General Assembly also finds that utilizing existing electric easements to provide broadband services, without the placement of additional poles or other ground based structures, does not change the physical use of the easement, interfere with or impair any vested rights of the owner or occupier of the real property subject to the electric easement, or place any additional burden on the property interests of such owner or occupier. Consequently, the installation and operation of broadband services within any electric easement are merely changes in the manner or degree of the granted use as appropriate to accommodate a new technology and, absent any applicable express prohibition contained in the instrument conveying or granting the electric easement, shall be deemed as a matter of law to be a permitted use within the scope of every electric easement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(5) If the proxy expressly provides, any proxy holder may appoint in writing a substitute to act in his place; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">The General Assembly finds that certain political subdivisions of this state now own and operate gas distribution systems to serve their citizens, inhabitants, and customers by providing them with gas for all purposes; and if such political subdivisions are to furnish, and if the members of the public in the areas they serve are to receive, adequate service, such political subdivisions must have adequate, dependable, and economical sources of gas supplies. The General Assembly declares that there exists in this state a need for an authority to function without profit in developing and promoting for the public good in this state adequate, dependable, and economical sources and supplies of gas for the purposes expressed in this Code section, and to assist in the financing of additions and other expenditures for the municipal gas systems of such political subdivisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">(1) It is in the public interest to establish a new regulatory model for the natural gas industry in Georgia to reflect the transition to a reliance on market based competition as the best mechanism for the selection and provision of natural gas services at the most efficient pricing; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

V or Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. III, Para. I because after the true up process had operated as intended, and after the fact, a marketer sought to obtain from the government amounts representing the marketer's commercial losses on gas delivered to the LLC's customers, and that was merely a "consequential" loss to the marketer.

In such proceeding, the commission shall also prescribe a mechanism by which 95 percent of the revenues to the electing distribution company from rates for interruptible distribution service shall be credited to the universal service fund established for that electing distribution company pursuant to Code Section 46-4-161. Each electing distribution company is authorized to retain for the benefit of its shareholders or owners 5 percent of the revenues the electing distribution company received from rates for interruptible service.

<p class="p10">(5) A plan for establishing and operating an electronic bulletin board by which the electing distribution company will provide marketers with equal and timely access to information relevant to the availability of firm distribution service. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Such surcharge shall be paid promptly upon receipt into the universal service fund. This surcharge shall not be applied to any hospital that has a medicare and Medicaid payor mix of at least 30 percent and has uncompensated writeoffs for the provision of charity, indigent, and free health care services of not less than 5 percent of such hospital's annual operating expenses based on the annual hospital surveys by the Department of Community Health.

In addition, the rates for firm distribution service of the electing distribution company shall be adjusted to eliminate any applicable recovery of the operation and maintenance expenses associated with such facilities and gas in storage in such facilities, as well as the return on investment attributable to the amount removed from the rate base. For purposes of such review and determination, the fact that such services have been obtained by a marketer which is not affiliated with the electing distribution company shall create a presumption that there are reasonably available alternatives for such peaking services in the delivery group. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The commission shall make a separate determination for each type of service.

<p class="p10">(3) At least every third year following the date when the rates for commodity sales service within a delivery group or groups become no longer subject to commission approval nor to the provisions of Code Section 46-2-26.5, the electing distribution company shall file, on or before August 1 of such year, a capacity supply plan which designates the array of available interstate capacity assets selected by the electing distribution company for the purpose of making gas available on its system for firm distribution service to retail customers in such delivery group or groups. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Not less than ten days after any such filing by an electing distribution company, the commission shall conduct a public hearing on the filing.

At any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection, the burden of proof to show that the proposed capacity supply plan is appropriate shall be upon the electing distribution company. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(C) Describe the criteria of the electing distribution company for entering into contracts under such array of interstate capacity assets from time to time to meet such requirements; provided, however, that a capacity supply plan approved or adopted by the commission shall not prescribe the individual contracts to be executed by the electing distribution company in order to implement such plan; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) Specify the portion of the interstate capacity assets which must be retained and utilized by the electing distribution company in order to manage and operate its system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) When interstate capacity assets that are contained in a capacity supply plan approved or adopted by the commission are allocated by the electing distribution company to a marketer pursuant to the provisions of this article, all of the costs of the interstate capacity assets thus allocated shall be borne by such marketer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) The provisions of law relating to parties, intervention, and discovery in proceedings before the commission shall apply with respect to proceedings under this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(9) All commission orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall contain the commission's findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the commission's action is based. Any such order shall be deemed a final order subject to judicial review under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(10) Prior to the approval or adoption of a capacity supply plan pursuant to this subsection, the interstate capacity assets of the electing distribution company in the most current gas supply plan of such company approved or adopted by the commission pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 46-2-26.5 shall be treated as a capacity supply plan that is approved or adopted by the commission for purposes of this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(11) After a capacity supply plan has become effective pursuant to provisions of this subsection as a result of a proceeding before the commission, the commission shall retain jurisdiction of the proceeding for the purposes set forth in this subsection. Upon application of the affected electing distribution company or upon its own initiative, the commission may, after affording due notice and opportunity for hearing to the affected electing distribution company and the intervenors in the proceeding, amend the capacity supply plan of the affected electing distribution company. Any such amendment shall not adversely affect rights under any contract entered into pursuant to such plan without the consent of the parties to such contracts. If an amendment proceeding is initiated by the affected electing distribution company and the commission fails or refuses to issue an order by the ninetieth day after the electing distribution company's filing, the amended capacity supply plan proposed by the electing distribution company shall thereupon be deemed approved by operation of law. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(12) After an electing distribution company has no obligation to provide commodity sales service to retail customers pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 46-4-156 and upon the petition of any interested person and after notice and opportunity for hearing afforded to the electing distribution company, all parties to the most current proceeding establishing a capacity supply plan for such electing distribution company, all marketers who have been issued a certificate of authority pursuant to Code Section 46-4-153, and all owners or operators of interstate gas pipelines that are a part of said capacity supply plan, the commission may issue an order eliminating the responsibility of the electing distribution company for acquiring and contracting for interstate capacity assets necessary for gas to be made available on its system as well as the obligation of such electing distribution company to file any further capacity supply plans with the commission pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, if the commission determines that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) Marketers can and will secure adequate and reliable interstate capacity assets necessary to make gas available on the system of the electing distribution company for service to firm retail customers; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) Adequate, reliable, and economical interstate capacity assets will not be diverted from use for service to retail customers in Georgia; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) There is a competitive, highly flexible, and reasonably accessible market for interstate capacity assets for service to retail customers in Georgia; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) Elimination of such responsibility on the part of the electing distribution company would not adversely affect competition for natural gas service to retail customers in Georgia; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) Elimination of such responsibility on the part of the electing distribution company is otherwise in the public interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">If the commission eliminates the responsibility of an electing distribution company for acquiring and contracting for interstate capacity assets and filing further capacity supply plans in accordance with this subsection, the commission shall annually review the assignment of interstate capacity assets. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(13) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Code section to the contrary, no later than July 1, 2003, the commission shall, after notice afforded to the electing distribution company, all marketers who have been issued a certificate of authority in accordance with Code Section 46-4-153, and all owners or operators of interstate gas pipelines that are a part of said capacity supply plan, hold a hearing regarding a plan for assignment of interstate assets. After such hearing, the commission may adopt a plan for assignment of interstate capacity assets held by the electing distribution company, except for those interstate capacity assets reasonably required for balancing. If adopted, the plan shall provide for interstate capacity assets to be assigned to certificated marketers who desire assignment and who are qualified technically and financially to manage interstate capacity assets. Marketers who accept assignment of interstate capacity assets shall be required by the commission to use such assets primarily to serve retail customers in Georgia and shall be permitted to use such assets outside Georgia so long as the reliability of the system is not compromised. Thereafter, the commission shall annually review the assignment of interstate capacity assets. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(14) Any order eliminating the responsibility of the electing distribution company for acquiring and contracting for interstate capacity assets pursuant to paragraph (12) of this subsection and any plan for assignment of interstate capacity assets pursuant to paragraph (13) of this subsection shall, at a minimum, ensure that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) Shifts in market share are reflected in an orderly reassignment of interstate capacity assets; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) Marketers hold sufficient interstate capacity assets to meet the needs of retail customers; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) Before any such assignment is authorized, the assignee demonstrates to the commission that such assignment will result in financial benefits to firm retail customers; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) Before any marketer discontinues service in the Georgia market, it assigns its contractual rights for interstate capacity assets used to serve Georgia retail customers in a manner designated by the commission; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) In the event that the commission imposes temporary directives in accordance with Code Section 46-4-157, interstate capacity assets assigned to marketers are subject to reassignment by the commission to protect the interests of retail customers; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(F) Any other requirement that the commission finds to be in the public interest is imposed upon assignees as a condition of the assignment of interstate capacity assets. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(15) After notice and an opportunity for hearing, the commission may authorize, subject to reasonable terms and conditions, an electing distribution company or its designee to utilize or monetize excess interstate capacity assets available to the electing distribution company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">The General Assembly finds that the rising cost and uncertain supply of energy resources require an active program of energy conservation assistance, especially for the residential sector, which often has limited access to expert advice on energy conservation. In response to this need and to the mandate of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, P.L. 95-619, the former Office of Energy Resources, now the Division of Energy Resources of the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, on behalf of the Office of Planning and Budget, has developed the state plan for the Residential Conservation Service, which requires certain utilities to offer home energy audits and related services to residential customers. Further, the General Assembly finds that in order to ensure the implementation of the state plan for the Residential Conservation Service and avoid the imposition of the federal plan, adequate authority for state enforcement of the state plan must be instituted. Therefore, in order to provide Georgia's regulated utilities and their customers with the most appropriate and flexible plan for carrying out the Residential Conservation Service, the General Assembly declares that the Office of Planning and Budget shall be authorized to promulgate regulations to establish the Residential Conservation Service and provide for its enforcement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">(a) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any telephone company chartered by the laws of this or any other state shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines and facilities upon, under, along, and over the public roads and highways and rights of way of this state with the approval of the county or municipal authorities in charge of such roads, highways, and rights of way. The approval of such municipal authorities shall be limited to the process set forth in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this Code section, and the approval of the county shall be limited to the permitting process set forth in subsection (c) of this Code section. Upon making due compensation, as defined for municipal authorities in paragraph (9) of subsection (b) of this Code section and as provided for counties in subsection (c) of this Code section, a telephone company shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines through or over any lands of this state; on, along, and upon the right of way and structures of any railroads; and, where necessary, under or over any private lands; and, to that end, a telephone company may have and exercise the right of eminent domain. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Notwithstanding any other law, a municipal authority or county shall not: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) Require any telephone company to apply for or enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement with such municipal authority or county; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) Impose any occupational license tax or fee as a condition of placing or maintaining lines and facilities in its public roads and highways or rights of way, except as specifically set forth in this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) A county or municipal authority shall not impose any occupational license, tax, fee, regulation, obligation, or requirement upon the provision of the services described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of Code Section 46-5-221, including any occupational license, tax, fee, regulation, obligation, or requirement specifically set forth in any part of this chapter other than Part 4. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Whenever a telephone company exercises its powers under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the posts, arms, insulators, and other fixtures of its lines shall be erected, placed, and maintained so as not to obstruct or interfere with the ordinary use of such railroads or public roads and highways, or with the convenience of any landowners, more than may be unavoidable. Any lines constructed by a telephone company on the right of way of any railroad company shall be subject to relocation so as to conform to any uses and needs of such railroad company for railroad purposes. Such fixtures, posts, and wires shall be erected at such distances from the tracks of said railroads as will prevent any and all damage to said railroad companies by the falling of said fixtures, posts, or wires upon said railroad tracks; and such telephone companies shall be liable to said railroad companies for all damages resulting from a failure to comply with this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) No county or municipal authority shall impose upon a telephone company any build-out requirements on network construction or service deployment, and, to the extent that a telephone company has elected alternative regulation pursuant to Code Section 46-5-165, such company may satisfy its obligations pursuant to paragraph (2) of Code Section 46-5-169 by providing communications service, at the company's option, through any affiliated companies and through the use of any technology or service arrangement; provided, however, that such company shall remain subject to its obligations as set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of Code Section 46-5-169. The obligations required pursuant to paragraph (2) of Code Section 46-5-169 shall not apply to a telephone company that has elected alternative regulation pursuant to Code Section 46-5-165 and does not receive distributions from the Universal Access Fund as provided for in Code Section 46-5-167. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as set forth in paragraph (6) of this subsection, any telephone company that places or seeks to place lines and facilities in the public roads and highways or rights of way of a municipal authority shall provide to such municipal authority the following information: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) The name, address, and telephone number of a principal office and local agent of such telephone company; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) Proof of certification from the Georgia Public Service Commission of such telephone company to provide telecommunications services in this state; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) Proof of insurance or self-insurance of such telephone company adequate to defend and cover claims of third parties and of municipal authorities; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) A description of the telephone company's service area, which description shall be sufficiently detailed so as to allow a municipal authority to respond to subscriber inquiries. For the purposes of this paragraph, a telephone company may, in lieu of or as a supplement to a written description, provide a map on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper that is clear and legible and that fairly depicts the service area within the boundaries of the municipal authority. If such service area is less than the boundaries of an entire municipal authority, the map shall describe the boundaries of the geographic area to be served in clear and concise terms; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) A description of the services to be provided; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(F) An affirmative declaration that the telephone company shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including municipal ordinances and regulations, regarding the placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights of way that are reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and applicable to all users of the public rights of way, including the requirements of Chapter 9 of Title 25, the "Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act"; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(G) A statement in bold type at the top of the application as follows: "Pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of Code Section 46-5-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, the municipal authority shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies in this application within 15 business days of receipt of this application." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) If an application is incomplete, the municipal authority shall notify the telephone company within 15 business days of the receipt of such application; such notice shall specifically identify all application deficiencies. If no such notification is given within 15 business days of the receipt of an application, such application shall be deemed complete. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Within 60 calendar days of the receipt of a completed application, the municipal authority may adopt such application by adoption of a resolution or ordinance or by notification to the telephone company. The failure of a municipal authority to adopt an application within 60 calendar days of the receipt of a completed application shall constitute final adoption of such application. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) If it modifies its service area or provisioned services identified in the original application, the telephone company shall notify the municipal authority of changes to the service area or the services provided. Such notice shall be given at least 20 days prior to the effective date of such change. Such notification shall contain a geographic description of the new service area or areas and new services to be provided within the jurisdiction of the affected municipal authority, if any. The municipal authority shall provide to all telephone companies located in its rights of way written notice of annexations and changes in municipal corporate boundaries which, for the purposes of this Code section, shall become effective 30 days following receipt. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) An application adopted pursuant to this Code section may be terminated by a telephone company by submitting a notice of termination to the affected municipal authority. For purposes of this Code section, such notice shall identify the telephone company, the affected service area, and the effective date of such termination, which shall not be less than 60 calendar days from the date of filing the notice of termination. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Any telephone company that has previously obtained permits for the placement of its facilities, has specified the name of such telephone company in such permit application, has previously placed its facilities in any public right of way, and has paid and continues to pay any applicable municipal authority's occupational license taxes, permit fees, franchise fees, except as set forth in paragraph (8) of this subsection, or, if applicable, county permit fees shall be deemed to have complied with this Code section without any further action on the part of such telephone company except as set forth in paragraphs (8), (9), (11), and (17) of this subsection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) Any telephone company that has placed lines and facilities in the public roads and highways or rights of way of a municipal authority without first obtaining permits or otherwise notifying the appropriate municipal authority of its presence in the public roads and highways or rights of way shall provide the information required by paragraph (1) of this subsection, if applicable, to such municipal authority on or before October 1, 2008. As of October 1, 2008, if any telephone company, other than those who meet the requirements of paragraph (6) of this subsection, has failed or fails to provide the information required by paragraph (1) of this subsection to the municipal authority in which its lines or facilities are located, such municipal authority shall provide written notice to such telephone company giving that company 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of such notice to comply with this subsection. In the event the 15 calendar day cure period expires without compliance, such municipal authority may petition the Georgia Public Service Commission which shall, after an opportunity for a hearing, order the appropriate relief. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) (A) In the event any telephone company has an existing, valid municipal franchise agreement as of January 1, 2008, the terms and conditions of such existing franchise agreement shall only remain effective and enforceable until the expiration of the existing agreement or December 31, 2012, whichever shall first occur. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) In the event any telephone company is paying an existing occupational license tax or fee, based on actual recurring local services revenues, as of January 1, 2008, such payment shall be considered the payment of due compensation without further action on the part of the municipal authority. In the event that the rate of such existing tax or fee exceeds 3 percent of actual recurring local service revenues, that rate shall remain effective until December 31, 2012; thereafter, the payment by such telephone company at the rate of 3 percent shall be considered the payment of due compensation without further action on the part of the municipal authority. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(9) As used in this Code section, "due compensation" for a municipal authority means an amount equal to no more than 3 percent of actual recurring local service revenues received by such company from its retail, end user customers located within the boundaries of such municipal authority. "Actual recurring local service revenues" means those revenues customarily included in the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission for Class "A" and "B" companies; provided, however, that only the local service portion of the following accounts shall be included: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) Basic local service revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5000; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) Basic area revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5001; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) Optional extended area revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5002; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(D) Public telephone revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5010; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(E) Local private line revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 35.5040; provided, however, that the portion of such accounts attributable to audio and video program transmission service where both terminals of the private line are within the corporate limits of the municipal authority shall not be included; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(F) Other local exchange revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5060; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(G) Local exchange service, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5069; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(H) Network access revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5080; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(I) Directory revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5230; provided, however, that the portion of such accounts attributable to revenue derived from listings in portion of directories not considered white pages shall not be included; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(J) Nonregulated operating revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5280; provided, however, that the portion of such accounts attributable to revenues derived from private lines shall not be included; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(K) Uncollectible revenue, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 32.5300. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">Any charge imposed by a municipal authority shall be assessed in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(10) Any due compensation paid to municipal authorities pursuant to paragraph (9) of this subsection shall be in lieu of any other permit fee, encroachment fee, degradation fee, disruption fee, business license tax, occupational license tax, occupational license fee, or other fee otherwise permitted pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (7) of Code Section 36-34-2 or Code Section 32-4-92 et seq. or any other provision of law regardless of nomenclature. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(11) A telephone company with facilities in the public rights of way of a municipal authority shall begin assessing due compensation, as defined in subsection (a) of this Code section, on subscribers on the date that service commences unless such company is currently paying a municipal authority's occupational license tax. Such due compensation shall be paid directly to each affected municipal authority within 30 calendar days after the last day of each calendar quarter. In the event that due compensation is not paid on or before 30 calendar days after the last day of each calendar quarter, the affected municipal authority shall provide written notice to such telephone company, giving such company 15 calendar days from the date such company receives such notice to cure any such nonpayment. In the event the due compensation remitted to the affected municipal authority is not postmarked on or before the expiration of the 15 day cure period, such company shall pay interest thereon at a rate of 1 percent per month to the affected municipal authority. If the 15 day cure period expires on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a state legal holiday, the due date shall be the next business day. A telephone company shall not be assessed any interest on late payments if due compensation was submitted in error to a neighboring municipal authority. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(12) Each municipal authority may, no more than once annually, audit the business records of a telephone company to the extent necessary to ensure payment in accordance with this Code section. As used in this Code section, "audit" means a comprehensive review of the records of a company which is reasonably related to the calculation and payment of due compensation. Once any audited period of a company has been the subject of a requested audit, such audited period of such company shall not again be the subject of any audit. In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of due compensation due to an affected municipal authority under this Code section, an action may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by an affected municipal authority seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due or by a company seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment; provided, however, that any such action shall be brought within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates, although such time period may be extended by written agreement between the company and such affected municipal authority. Each party shall bear the party's own costs incurred in connection with any dispute.

<p class="p4"><b>Maintenance of poles in middle of street does not constitute negligence as matter of law.</b> - Since the city can lawfully authorize the erection of the poles in the middle of the street, the acquiescence by the city in the maintenance of the poles in the middle of the street, although they had originally been erected there by the power company in violation of the restriction placed by the city on the manner of their erection, amounts to a waiver by the city of the restriction which it had imposed upon the power company, and the maintenance by the power company of the poles in the middle of the street, while acquiesced in by the city, and where otherwise not unlawful, does not, as to persons lawfully using the street, constitute negligence as a matter of law.

<p class="p10">(2) It shall be unlawful for any person to use, to employ or direct another person to use, or to contract for the use of ADAD equipment for the purpose of advertising or offering for sale, lease, rental, or as a gift any goods, services, or property, either real or personal, primarily for personal, family, or household use or for the purpose of conducting polls or soliciting information where: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) Consent is not received prior to the initiation of the calls as specified in paragraph (3) of this subsection; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</b></p>
<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid. There currently exist numerous different emergency phone numbers throughout the state. Provision for a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public service efforts by making it easier to notify public safety personnel. Such a simplified means of procuring emergency services will result in the saving of lives, a reduction in the destruction of property, and quicker apprehension of criminals. It is the intent of the General Assembly to establish and implement a cohesive state-wide emergency telephone number 9-1-1 system which will provide citizens with rapid, direct access to public safety agencies by dialing telephone number 9-1-1 with the objective of reducing the response time to situations requiring law enforcement, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly further finds and declares that the benefits of 9-1-1 service should be widely available, regardless of whether a 9-1-1 call is placed from a traditional landline telephone or from a wireless telephone. It is also in the public interest that users of wireless telephones should bear some of the cost of providing this lifesaving service, as users of landline telephones currently do. It is the intent of the General Assembly to bring wireless telephone service within the scope of this part and to establish a means by which local public safety agencies may provide enhanced 9-1-1 service to wireless telephone users. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly further finds and declares that communication technology is rapidly and constantly changing. It is in the public interest that as different means of accessing 9-1-1 service emerge, that the users of such technology bear some of the cost of providing this lifesaving service, as users of landline and wireless telephones currently do. It is the intent of the General Assembly to bring these new and emerging technologies within the scope of this part and establish a means by which local public safety agencies may provide 9-1-1 service to such users. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(d)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly further finds and declares that the safety and well-being of the citizens of Georgia is of the utmost importance, and it is in the public interest to provide the highest level of emergency response service on a local, regional, and state-wide basis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly further finds that the collection methodology for prepaid wireless telecommunications service should effectively capture 9-1-1 charges from prepaid users. It is the intent of the General Assembly to move the collection of existing 9-1-1 charges on prepaid wireless service to the retail point of sale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Such 9-1-1 charge shall be $1.50 per month per telephone service provided to the telephone subscriber except as reduced pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(ii) In computing the amount due under this subsection, the number of 9-1-1 charges a telephone subscriber shall be assessed shall not exceed the number of simultaneous outbound calls that can be made from voice channels the service supplier has activated and enabled. For telephone service that provides to multiple locations shared simultaneous outbound voice channel capacity configured to and capable of accessing a 9-1-1 system in different states, the monthly 9-1-1 charge shall be assessed only for the portion of such shared voice channel capacity in this state as identified by the service supplier's books and records. In determining the portion of shared capacity in this state, a service supplier may rely on, among other factors, a customer's certification of its allocation of capacity in this state, which may be based on each end user location, the total number of end users, and the number of end users at each end user location. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) All telephone services billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt from the 9-1-1 charge.

As part of its normal billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 9-1-1 charge for each month a telephone service is in service, and it shall list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a service supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a surcharge or separate entry on each bill. Service suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a service supplier receives a partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service supplier first. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality of amendment.</b> - Georgia Laws 1907, p. 72 does not offend the Constitution of Georgia. Wadley S. Ry. v. State, 137 Ga. 497, 73 S.E. 741 (1912), aff'd, 235 U.S. 651, 35 S. Ct. 214, 59 L. Ed. 405 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of commission.</b> - The Railroad Commission (now Public Service Commission) is an administrative, and not a legislative, body. It has only such powers as the legislature has expressly, or by fair implication, conferred upon it. Southern Ry. v. Melton, 133 Ga. 277, 65 S.E. 665 (1909); Zuber v. Southern Ry., 9 Ga. App. 539, 71 S.E. 937 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Powers of commission in general.</b> - Public Service Commission has only such powers as are granted to it by statute. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 205 Ga. 863, 55 S.E.2d 618 (1949). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Public Service Commission has power to regulate rates and practices of public utilities. Gas Light Co. v. Georgia Power Co., 440 F.2d 1135 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1062, 92 S. Ct. 732, 30 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commission has power to prevent unjust discrimination in handling of freight.</b> - The commission has power to promulgate a rule requiring railroad companies, in the conduct of their intrastate business, to afford to all persons equal facilities in the transportation and delivery of freight, without unjust discrimination against any. Augusta Brokerage Co. v. Central of Ga. Ry., 121 Ga. 48, 48 S.E. 714 (1904); Southern Ry. v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 218 Ga. 157, 127 S.E.2d 12 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Commission may declare unlawful practice of dispensing with prepayment of charges.</b> - Under the power given by former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2630 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-20) it was competent for the commission to declare as an unlawful discrimination a course of conduct whereby a railroad company, connecting with other railroad companies at each of its termini, which converge to a common point, affording a choice of routes from the common point to stations on its own line, received from one of its connections freights destined to points on its own line without requiring repayment of the earned charges of the favored carrier, and declined to receive from the connecting carrier at the other terminus freight destined to points on its own line without prepayment of the freight charges earned by that connecting carrier, where the conditions were substantially similar, and the effect of the course of conduct was to seriously curtail competition in rates and service to the patrons on its own line. Wadley S. Ry. v. State, 137 Ga. 497, 73 S.E. 741 (1912), aff'd, 235 U.S. 651, 35 S. Ct. 214, 59 L. Ed. 405 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

(see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 46-2-21, 46-8-20, 46-9-130, and 46-9-131), it was evident that the power of a common carrier to make reasonable regulations must yield where regulations have been made by authority of the state, unless they are invalid. Railroad Comm'n v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., 140 Ga. 817, 80 S.E. 327, 1915E L.R.A. 902, 1915A Ann. Cas. 1018 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between "transportation" and "switching" or "transfer" service.</b> - The test of distinction between "transportation" service relative to loaned freight-cars for which a railway company can lawfully charge tonnage rates, and "switching" or "transfer" service for which it was restricted to a fixed charge per car under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2189 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-20), was not whether the movement of the cars involved the use of a portion of the company's main line, or that of another, for there may be a transportation service over one or more spur-tracks of the same company, if the contract of affreightment required no movement over other tracks or lines of railway; whereas a switching or transfer service was one which preceded or followed a transportation service, and applied only to a shipment on which legal freight charges have already been earned, or were to be earned. Dixon v. Central of Ga. Ry., 110 Ga. 173, 35 S.E. 369 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Venue upon failure to erect depot.</b> - If a railroad company of this state refused to comply with an order passed by the Commissioners, requiring it to erect a depot building as empowered by former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2189 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-20), such refusal, in contemplation of law, was at the company's principal office, or place of business, and consequently controlled the venue.

<p class="p4"><b>Commission's exclusive power to make intrastate rates.</b> - Power to make intrastate rates is exclusive prerogative of Public Service Commission. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Lumberman's Co., 168 Ga. 851, 149 S.E. 128 (1929). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2630 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-20) the commission had the power to determine what are just and reasonable rates and charges for transportation of passengers of each of the railroads doing business in this state. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R., 164 Ga. 822, 139 S.E. 725 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What matters to be considered in rate-making.</b> - What is just and reasonable to be charged, what is actuarially sound, what limitations of liability are necessary to reach this result, are matters which need to be taken into account in the determination of public utility rates, just as there are proper actuarial considerations in fixing insurance premiums. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel Co. v. Invenchek, Inc., 130 Ga. App. 798, 204 S.E.2d 457 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Hill v. Wadley S. Ry., 128 Ga. 705, 57 S.E. 795 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No fixed and arbitrary rule for making of joint rate.</b> - There was no fixed and arbitrary rule for making of joint rate. It was often done by deducting some prescribed percent from each of the local rates and adding together the two rates thus reduced; but this was not the only possible method of fixing a rate which will fall within the term, "joint rate," as used in former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2189 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-20). Hill v. Wadley S. Ry., 128 Ga. 705, 57 S.E. 795 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Customers lack property interest in utility rate increases.</b> - Utility customers have no sufficient property interest in given utility rate increase to invoke procedural protections of due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. 14.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Entitlement to lower rate must be shown to challenge increase on constitutional grounds.</b> - Utility customers must show they have a legal entitlement to or a vested right in the utility rates being charged before any proposed increase, before they can claim any property rights protected by the United States Constitution. Georgia Power Project v. Georgia Power Co., 409 F. Supp. 332 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Large discretion in location of route.</b> - Where a railroad company has the right to condemn private property for public uses in the construction and operation of its road, it has a large discretion in the selection of a location for its route over such property; and unless such discretion has been abused, it will not be controlled or interfered with by the courts. Piedmont Cotton Mills v. Georgia Ry. &amp; Elec. Co., 131 Ga. 129, 62 S.E. 52 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testimony regarding road location admissible as to bad faith in selection.</b> - Upon the trial of a case wherein the owner of the property through which it is proposed to run such road complains that such discretion of the company has been abused by it, it is error to exclude testimony relevant and material upon the issue as to whether or not the company has acted in bad faith in the selection of such location. Piedmont Cotton Mills v. Georgia Ry. &amp; Elec. Co., 131 Ga. 129, 62 S.E. 52 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Testimony of attempts by condemnor to acquire property admissible for injunction against condemnation.</b> - Upon the trial of a case wherein the owner of land seeks to have a party having the right of condemnation enjoined from condemning his land, it is not error to admit testimony of such condemnor that he made an effort, before instituting such condemnation proceeding, to acquire by contract the property sought to be condemned and failed in such effort. Piedmont Cotton Mills v. Georgia Ry. &amp; Elec. Co., 131 Ga. 129, 62 S.E. 52 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Manner of exercise of eminent domain power.</b> - It was provided by former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2588 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-124) that in the event the company cannot procure from the owners title to the right of way or other lands necessary and proper for the construction of stations, terminal facilities, and the like, such property may be acquired in the manner prescribed in T. 22. Atlantic &amp; B.R.R. v. Penny, 119 Ga. 479, 46 S.E. 665 (1904); Bibb Brick Co. v. Central of Ga. Ry., 151 Ga. 83, 105 S.E. 833 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When property of other railroad may be condemned.</b> - The property of another railroad company may be condemned if the property thus sought to be acquired is not actually used by the other company for railroad purposes, and will not be needed by that company for such purposes in the immediate future. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Atlanta, B. &amp; A.R.R., 124 Ga. 125, 52 S.E. 320 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Railroad taking easement of other railroad must pay compensation.</b> - Where a railroad lays its track in a city street with the permission of the city, it acquires an easement, and such easement will be as much protected from unlawful invasion as any other property right. The construction of a railroad track by another railroad across the street and its track amounts to a taking of its property by the crossing railroad, and the easement holder is entitled to have such construction enjoined until compensation is paid.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere presence of safety precautions does not absolve railroad from negligence.</b> - Mere presence of safety precautions such as automatic signalling devices does not render railroad free from negligence as matter of law or relieve it from adopting such other measures as public safety and common prudence dictate; this is especially true when the evidence shows that a train was running at an undue and highly dangerous rate of speed over a much frequented crossing located in a city or town.

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duties to persons on tracks not declared by statute.</b> - The defendant may owe many duties to a person on its tracks, the presence of whom it is bound to anticipate, whether as trespasser or licensee, which are not declared by statute. Southern Ry. v. Waldrup, 76 Ga. App. 356, 45 S.E.2d 775 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of employees to keep lookout.</b> - If those in control of the movement of the train have no reason to apprehend that there may likely be a human being on the track in front of the engine, they are under no duty to one who may in fact be there until they have actually discovered that one is there; but if, from the locality or surrounding circumstances, there is reason to apprehend that the track in front of the locomotive may not be clear of human beings, then it is the duty of the employees of the company to keep a lookout ahead of the train. Hunt v. Pollard, 51 Ga. App. 948, 181 S.E. 793 (1935), later appeal, 55 Ga. App. 423, 190 S.E. 71 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Peddler permitted to be on property a licensee.</b> - A peddler, in going in between the tracks to a railroad car for the purpose of vending the peddler's wares to the employees of a railroad company, where this was permitted by the employees for their benefit, is a licensee, and it can not be said that the peddler's presence there is negligence as a matter of law. Hunt v. Pollard, 51 Ga. App. 948, 181 S.E. 793 (1935), later appeal, 55 Ga. App. 423, 190 S.E. 71 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>2. Passengers</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duration of carriers liability to passengers.</b> - Liability of carrier to passengers begins at starting point and does not end until passenger is discharged. Metts v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., 52 Ga. App. 115, 182 S.E. 531 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No liability generally to one traveling on gratuitous pass including liability limitation.</b> - A railroad company cannot be held liable for injuries received by a passenger while being transported over the company's lines by virtue of a gratuitous pass, which exempted the company from liability for injuries caused by ordinary negligence, unless the injuries were inflicted willfully and wantonly; to authorize a recovery against the company by such a person, it must appear that the conduct of the defendant was such as to evince a willful intention to inflict such an injury, or else was so reckless or so charged with indifference to the consequences, where human life, limb, or health was involved, as to justify the jury in finding a wantonness equivalent in spirit to actual intent. Devero v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 51 Ga. App. 699, 181 S.E. 421 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employee traveling on gratuitous pass a passenger for hire.</b> - Where one employed generally by a railroad is issued trip passes on trains to go to and from work, and who is also permitted to ride without the payment of fare without using one's pass, and who is not engaged in or within the scope of one's employment while so riding on a train, one occupies the status of a passenger for hire, and the railroad is liable to that person for injuries inflicted by its negligence, while one is so riding, and if the injury occurs at a time when the employee is using one's pass, a limitation therein relieving the railroad from liability on account of its negligence is void. Fowler v. Western &amp; A.R.R., 75 Ga. App. 156, 42 S.E.2d 499 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ejection of passenger where negligence not involved may be improper conduct.</b> - Where an action against a carrier was founded upon the alleged wrongful ejection of the plaintiff as a passenger, and no negligence of the carrier or the carrier's employees was alleged, the wrong complained of was to be regarded not as negligence, but as "improper conduct," under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2779 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-290), and the law relating to diligence and negligence on the part of carriers with reference to their passengers is not involved. Georgia Ry. &amp; Power Co. v. Turner, 33 Ga. App. 101, 125 S.E. 598 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages recoverable for unlawful ejection.</b> - One who is unlawfully ejected from a train may recover all damages which proximately flow from the expulsion, excluding all damages which, although in some measure traceable to the wrongful act, are not its natural and probable consequence.

<p class="p6"><b>3. Trespassers</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General rule of liability only to discovered trespasser.</b> - The general rule is that a railroad company owes to a trespasser, walking upon its tracks, the duty not to injure the trespasser willfully or wantonly after the trespasser's presence is known to its servants in charge of the train; but this duty is not active until the trespasser's presence is actually known. Collett v. Atlanta, B. &amp; C.R.R., 51 Ga. App. 637, 181 S.E. 207 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where party is a trespasser, and the party is not in a path which the railroad knows people customarily use, the only duty the railroad owes the party is not to wantonly or willfully injure the trespasser after the trespasser's presence is discovered. Cook v. Southern Ry., 62 Ga. App. 613, 9 S.E.2d 123 (1940). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ordinarily, the servants of a railway company are not bound to anticipate the presence of a trespasser on or about its tracks, and the duty of exercising ordinary care in order to protect such a trespasser does not generally arise until after the trespasser's presence has been actually discovered. Southern Ry. v. Kelley, 52 Ga. App. 137, 182 S.E. 631 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General rule of liability applies to dead body on tracks.</b> - Ordinarily the only duty which a railway company owes to a trespasser upon or about its property is not to injure the trespasser willfully or wantonly after the trespasser's presence has been discovered, and this principle of law applies to the duty of a railway company towards a dead body which happens to be upon its tracks. Pollard v. Phelps, 56 Ga. App. 408, 193 S.E. 102 (1937).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability rule does not apply where private passageway used with knowledge of railroad.</b> - Where a number of persons habitually, with the knowledge and without the disapproval of a railroad company, use a private passageway for the purpose of crossing the tracks of the company at a given point, the employees of the company in charge of one of its trains, who are aware of the custom, are bound on a given occasion to anticipate that persons may be upon the tracks at this point, but it is not their duty to take such precautions as would prevent injury to such person; their duty is merely to take such precautions to prevent such injury as ordinary care and diligence would require. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Hemmings, 66 Ga. App. 881, 19 S.E.2d 787 (1942); Southern Ry. v. Waldrup, 76 Ga. App. 356, 45 S.E.2d 775 (1947). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where there is evidence that the portion of the switchyard where an accident occurred was not in fact used as a switchyard but rather was used as a passageway with the knowledge of the railroad, the rule that the railroad owes a duty of ordinary care to a trespasser only after discovering the trespasser does not apply. McClain v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 473 F.2d 357 (5th Cir. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability rule requires railroads to anticipate trespassers in certain areas.</b> - Whether plaintiff is a trespasser or licensee, the railroad is bound to use ordinary care and diligence in approaching and traversing places where there is reason for it to anticipate that persons might be on the track; in such a situation, the general rule, that the railroad owes a trespasser a duty of ordinary care only after discovery of the trespasser in a place of peril, does not apply. McClain v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 473 F.2d 357 (5th Cir. 1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where, from the locality, circumstances, and known habits of the public generally, there is reason to apprehend that the track in front of the locomotive may not be clear of human beings, then the duty of anticipating the presence of and danger to such trespassers devolves on the employees of the company operating the train. Southern Ry. v. Kelley, 52 Ga. App. 137, 182 S.E. 631 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it is true that a railroad track is a place of danger, and one who trespasses thereon is guilty of negligence, yet when the railroad company discovers this negligence, or has reason to anticipate it, and such a trespasser is on the track in an apparently helpless condition, ordinary diligence requires the use of every means then available to avoid running down and killing the trespasser; and if, under such circumstances, this degree of care is not exercised, and death results, the killing will be deemed in law to have been willful and wanton. Hammontree v. Southern Ry., 50 Ga. App. 822, 179 S.E. 155 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to anticipate or discover presence of people not willful or wanton misconduct.</b> - The mere failure of the employees of a railway company to discover the presence of a trespasser at a place where, and at a time when, it was their duty to anticipate the presence of trespassers, and thereafter to take such needful and proper measures for the trespasser's protection as ordinary care might require, might amount to a lack of ordinary care but would not, in and of itself, amount to willful and wanton misconduct. Hammontree v. Southern Ry., 50 Ga. App. 822, 179 S.E. 155 (1935); Southern Ry. v. Kelley, 52 Ga. App. 137, 182 S.E. 631 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Railroad might be liable for lack of ordinary care in not anticipating trespasser's presence.</b> - If the presence of a trespasser on the track at the time and place of the injury is brought about by peculiar facts and circumstances which relieve the trespasser from the guilt of a lack of ordinary care in thus exposing oneself, the company might be liable for a lack of ordinary care on its part in failing to anticipate the trespasser's presence at a time when and a place where it was charged with such duty, and in thereafter failing to take such proper precautions for the trespasser's safety as might seem reasonably necessary. Southern Ry. v. Kelley, 52 Ga. App. 137, 182 S.E. 631 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability for failure to discover presence of livestock on tracks.</b> - Railroad companies may be held liable for ordinary negligence in failing to discover presence of livestock or other domestic animals on tracks or in avoiding their injury, as well as for their willful or wanton killing by failing to exercise ordinary care after becoming aware of their presence. Powell v. Nelson, 52 Ga. App. 351, 183 S.E. 348 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Domestic animals not to be regarded as trespassers.</b> - Domestic animals ranging on unenclosed rights of way of railroad companies are not to be regarded as trespassers, and the companies owe to the owners of such animals the duty of exercising ordinary care both in discovering their presence on railroad tracks and in avoiding their injury. Powell v. Nelson, 52 Ga. App. 351, 183 S.E. 348 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Railroad companies not required to reduce speed of trains during bad weather to avoid injuring animals.</b> - The law expects railroad companies to run their passenger trains on schedule, so far as they may be able to do so; and they are not ordinarily required, when it is foggy or raining, to reduce their trains to such a rate of speed that the engineer may be in a position to discover livestock on the track in time to prevent injuring them. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Sears, 80 Ga. App. 338, 56 S.E.2d 129 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Procedure where animal near track in place of safety.</b> - Railroad company is not required to slow up or to check its trains when animal is seen near the track in place of safety, unless the animal is apparently approaching the track, or there is apparent danger that, through fright or otherwise, it will get on the track. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Sears, 80 Ga. App. 338, 56 S.E.2d 130 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When engineer charged with duty of stopping train.</b> - Only when the engineer sees, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence could see, that an animal in proximity to the track is in danger of getting on it in front of the moving train, is one charged with the duty of exercising all reasonable diligence to check the train and to avoid killing or injuring the animal. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Sears, 80 Ga. App. 338, 56 S.E.2d 130 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence insufficient to prove dog killed by train.</b> - Evidence that the plaintiff's dog was found lying dead about ten feet from the defendant's railroad track, that there were no marks or lacerations on the dog, but the slag along railroad looked as though something had been knocked or dragged over it, is insufficient to authorize inference that the dog was killed by the operation of one of the defendant's trains.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No action where party could have avoided accident by exercising ordinary care.</b> - Where one who is injured by the running of a railroad train could by the exercise of ordinary care for one's own safety, have avoided the consequences to oneself of the defendant's negligence after it came into existence and was known to defendant, or could have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care, an action for damages against the railroad company on account of negligence will not lie.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Negligence of person injured does not bar recovery where railroad guilty of gross negligence.</b> - If a homicide occurs at a place upon the track of a railway company where it is the duty of the servants of the company to anticipate the presence of persons on the track, and their failure to so anticipate the presence of others thereon amounts to mere negligence, the negligence of the person killed, under such circumstances, amounting to the lack of ordinary care for one's safety, will prevent a recovery by a plaintiff who sues for such homicide, but if the servants of the company are guilty of willful and wanton negligence, which results in the homicide of the person killed, then the negligence of the person killed, however gross, will not defeat a recovery of damages for such homicide by a plaintiff who is entitled under the law to sue therefor. Pressley v. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R., 48 Ga. App. 382, 172 S.E. 731 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Operator of train may assume person will not leave place of safety.</b> - While the operators of trains and cars are bound to anticipate the presence of persons crossing the tracks on pathways of the kind involved, yet, where they see a person in a position of safety on such pathway, and it is apparent to them that such person is proceeding in a direction of continued safety, such operators have the right to presume that such person will continue in the place of safety, and not abruptly turn and step in front of the on-coming train or car.

<p class="p4"><b>Duty of person in good health to look for approaching trains.</b> - Person in generally good health is bound as matter of law to look for approach of trains and cars, and where such person steps upon the railroad tracks in front of oncoming cars without looking, and the employees of the company on the cars immediately shout at such person and apply the brakes, such operators are in the use of ordinary care for the protection of such pedestrian, and such pedestrian was lacking in due care for the pedestrian's own safety as a matter of law to such an extent as to bar recovery.

<p class="p4"><b>Complaint alleging mutilation of dead body sets out cause of action.</b> - Complaint alleging that a railroad company wantonly and wrongfully ran its train over, mangled, and mutilated the dead body of the husband of the plaintiff, such mangling and mutilation not being incident to the homicide of the deceased but occurring thereafter, set out a cause of action in favor of the plaintiff where plaintiff was entitled in law to receive the body after death.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere allegations of injuries insufficient to make case where railroad owed no duty.</b> - Where there were no allegations of willful and wanton negligence, nor is there any proof of the same, proof by plaintiff that injuries were caused by running of train does not make out a prima facie case against defendant railroad, where plaintiff was at a place where defendant owed plaintiff no duty until after plaintiff was discovered.

<p class="p4"><b>Charge on invalidity of attempt to limit liability erroneous in absence of such attempt.</b> - It is error to give charge that where the person or property of an individual shall be injured or the property destroyed, by the negligence of any railroad company, such company shall be liable to pay damages, notwithstanding any bylaws, rules, and regulations, or notice which may be given by such company, limiting its liability where there are no issues in the case involving an effort by the defendant to limit its liability by rules.

Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Mitchell, 157 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Contributory negligence does not bar recovery by plaintiff unless plaintiff's negligence is equal to or greater than that of defendant.

Campbell v. Southern Ry., 198 F. Supp. 661 (N.D. Ga. 1961), aff'd, 309 F.2d 569 (5th Cir. 1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">The true comparative-negligence rule is that, if a plaintiff and defendant are both guilty of negligence which concurs proximately to bring about an injury to a plaintiff, and if the defendant's negligence is sufficient to predicate an action on, for example, ordinary negligence, and if the plaintiff is negligent, even if plaintiff's negligence amounts to a failure to exercise ordinary care, and the plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant, the plaintiff is still entitled to recover, provided the plaintiff could not have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence by the exercise of ordinary care after it was actually discovered or should have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care. Willis v. Jones, 89 Ga. App. 824, 81 S.E.2d 517 (1954). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The comparative negligence rule is that where there is negligence by both parties which is concurrent and contributes to the injury sued for, a recovery by the plaintiff is not barred, but plaintiff's damages shall be diminished by an amount proportioned to the amount of fault attributable to plaintiff, provided that plaintiff's fault is less than the defendants, and that, by the exercise of ordinary care, plaintiff could not have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence after it became apparent or in the exercise of ordinary care should have been discovered by the plaintiff. Rogers v. McKinley, 48 Ga. App. 262, 172 S.E. 662 (1934), later appeal, 52 Ga. 161, 182 S.E. 805 (1935); Georgia Power Co. v. Maxwell, 52 Ga.

Lamb v. McAfee, 18 Ga. App. 584, 90 S.E. 103 (1916), later appeal, 26 Ga. App. 3, 105 S.E. 250 (1920).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Southern Ry. v. Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 376 F. Supp. 96 (S.D. Ga. 1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How damages calculated.</b> - If jury finds the plaintiff was negligent, and that neither plaintiff's negligence nor defendant's negligence was the sole proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries, but that plaintiff's negligence and defendant's negligence combined to cause plaintiff's injuries, and the defendant's negligence was greater than the plaintiff's, then they should find a verdict for the plaintiff in an amount calculated by determining the total amount in which plaintiff has been damaged, and then reducing that amount in proportion to the negligence of the plaintiff compared with that of the defendant. Underwood v. Atlanta &amp; W. Point R.R., 105 Ga. App. 340, 124 S.E.2d 758, aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 218 Ga. 193, 126 S.E.2d 785 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Comparative negligence doctrine denies any recovery if plaintiff's negligence equals or exceeds defendant's. Damages are proportionately reduced where the latter's fault exceeds that of the plaintiff. Thus, if each party is 50 percent at fault, there can be no recovery. But should plaintiff's negligence be 49 percent, plaintiff is entitled to recover 51 percent of plaintiff's damages. Southern Ry. v. Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 376 F. Supp. 96 (S.D.

<p class="p4">The plaintiff can never recover in an action for personal injuries, no matter what the negligence of the defendant may be, short of actual wantonness, when the proof shows plaintiff could, by ordinary care, after the negligence of the defendant began or was existing, have avoided the consequences to oneself of that negligence; the law of contributory negligence is applicable only where both parties are at fault, and when, also, the plaintiff could not by ordinary care have avoided the injury which the defendant's negligence produced. Pollard v. Kent, 59 Ga. App. 118, 200 S.E. 542 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Rule of ordinary care extends to negligence discoverable by plaintiff.</b> - The rule that, in order for the plaintiff to recover plaintiff must have exercised ordinary care to avoid the consequences to oneself caused by the defendant's negligence is not limited to the negligence of the defendant which may have been actually discovered, but extends also to the negligence which might have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care on the plaintiff's part.

<p class="p4"><b>Last clear chance doctrine applied to plaintiff.</b> - The failure to exercise ordinary care to escape the consequences of the defendant's negligence which is a bar arises in situations in which the defendant's negligence exists first and is apparent or may readily be known, and the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care, can escape its consequences but does not. It is the doctrine of "the last clear chance" applied to the plaintiff instead of to the defendant. Southern Ry. v. Wilbanks, 67 F.2d 424 (5th Cir. 1933), cert. denied, 291 U.S. 678, 54 S.

<p class="p4"><b>Jumping from moving train.</b> - Plaintiff's injuries were solely caused by plaintiff's own decision to jump from a train after helping a passenger on board, and a car attendant's actions did not constitute an inducement to plaintiff to attempt to leave the train while in motion, where the attendant exercised no control over the movement or management of the train, and the attendant specifically advised plaintiff to remain on the train until it stopped at the next station.

<p class="p4"><b>No error in failing to charge express words of section where jury fully instructed.</b> - Where the court has instructed the jury that the plaintiff could not recover if the decedent could have avoided death by the exercise of ordinary care or if decedent's negligence was the proximate cause of death, and having also fully instructed the jury upon the law of comparative negligence, there was no error, especially in the absence of a written request, in the failure of the court to give in charge the express terms of former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2781 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-291).

<p class="p4"><b>Amount of evidence making comparative negligence charge appropriate.</b> - The amount of evidence which makes a comparative negligence charge appropriate, and thus rendered it error to refuse a timely request, need not be great, but it was sufficient if there was slight evidence from which inferences of negligence can be drawn by the jury.

<p class="p4"><b>This section and </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 51-11-7 to be charged separately.</b> - The different rules contained in this section and <span class="s1">§</span> 51-11-7 should not be so stated as to mislead the jury into believing that they would be authorized to find that the plaintiff, in an action for personal injuries against a railroad company, can recover when, by the use of ordinary care, plaintiff could have avoided the consequences to oneself caused by the defendant's negligence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to charge </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 51-11-7 not error where qualification of diminished damages unnecessary.</b> - Where the court, in stating to the jury a number of contingencies in which the plaintiff could not recover, instructs the jury that if the negligence of the plaintiff was equal to or greater than that of the defendant the plaintiff could not recover, the charge is not error for the reason that the court failed to qualify the diminished damages rule by the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 105-603 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-11-7), because if the plaintiff's negligence was not merely less than, but equal to or greater than, that of the defendant, the defendant would not be liable, and the qualification was unnecessary.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>3. Specific Instructions</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge that plaintiff could have avoided injury by exercise of ordinary care.</b> - In the trial of an action wherein the plaintiff seeks recovery of damages for injuries alleged to be due to the negligence of a railroad company at a public crossing, where the evidence authorizes a finding that the plaintiff could have avoided the negligence of the railroad company by the exercise of ordinary care, it is error for the court to refuse to give a charge on request that if the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care, could have avoided the consequences to oneself caused by defendant's negligence, plaintiff would not be entitled to recover. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Green, 84 Ga. App. 674, 67 S.E.2d 184 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charging no recovery where plaintiff's negligence equal to or greater than defendant's.</b> - It is proper for court to instruct jury that plaintiff cannot recover if his negligence is equal to or greater than defendant's negligence. Yellow Cab Co. v. Adams, 71 Ga. App. 404, 31 S.E.2d 195 (1944). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the judge charged the law of contributory negligence and diminution of damages substantially as set out in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-703 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-291), it furnishes no ground for a new trial that the court failed, in connection with such charge, to also instruct the jury that if the parties were equally negligent there could be no recovery. Southern Ry. v. Maddox, 63 Ga. App. 508, 11 S.E.2d 501 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charge on diminishing damages proper.</b> - A charge that, if the plaintiff and the defendant are both at fault, the plaintiff may nevertheless recover, but the damage should be diminished in proportion to the amount of default attributable to the plaintiff, states a correct rule of law and is not subject to the objection that it contains as instruction to the jury that the plaintiff can recover, if plaintiff's negligence is equal to the negligence of the defendant. Southern Ry. v. Reed, 40 Ga. App. 332, 149 S.E. 582 (1929). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The instruction: "If you find that the deceased and the defendant were both negligent, and then negligence of the deceased was equal to or greater than that of the defendant, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover. If you should find that both the deceased and the defendant were negligent, but that the negligence of the defendant was greater than that of the deceased, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, if otherwise entitled to recover under the rules I have given you, but in such event you would reduce the amount of the recovery in proportion to the negligence of the deceased, if she was guilty of such negligence," is not reversible error. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking Co. v. Farmer, 45 Ga. App. 130, 164 S.E. 71 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to charge negligence before duty to avoid negligence arises.</b> - A court errs in charging the jury that, under the comparative-negligence rule and doctrine, the plaintiff would be barred from recovery if the plaintiff was guilty of a failure to exercise ordinary care before plaintiff's duty to discover and avoid the negligence of the defendant arose. Willis v. Jones, 89 Ga. App. 824, 81 S.E.2d 517 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charging "avoidance of consequences" and "apportionment of damages" together.</b> - It is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>error to charge "avoidance of consequences" rule and in immediate connection therewith "apportionment of damages" rule, in such manner as to qualify the former by the latter, and without making the proper explanation as to the class of cases to which this latter charge is applicable. Underwood v. Atlanta &amp; W. Point R.R., 105 Ga. App. 340, 124 S.E.2d 758, aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 218 Ga. 193, 126 S.E.2d 785 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Charging plaintiff's negligence less than failure to exercise ordinary care.</b> - Where court instructed that, in order for the plaintiff to be entitled to a reduced recovery in the event the plaintiff and defendant both were negligent, the jury must find that the plaintiff's negligence was "less than failure to exercise ordinary care," the instruction was improper. Underwood v. Atlanta &amp; W. Point R.R., 105 Ga. App. 340, 124 S.E.2d 758, aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 218 Ga. 193, 126 S.E.2d 785 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to charge recovery where plaintiff's negligence greater than defendant's.</b> - It is error to charge that plaintiff can recover if both plaintiff and the defendant were negligent although plaintiff's negligence exceeded that of defendant. Georgia Power Co. v. Maxwell, 52 Ga. App. 430, 183 S.E. 654 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to charge plaintiff's negligence bars recovery in car collision.</b> - In an action by a traveler upon a highway, against a railway company, for damages resulting from a collision between a car of the company and the vehicle in which the traveler was riding, it is error to charge the jury that "the plaintiff's contributory negligence in such a case defeats recovery, and your verdict must be for the defendant." Thomas v. Gainesville &amp; D.E. Ry., 124 Ga. 748, 52 S.E. 801 (1906); Savannah Elec. Co. v. Crawford, 130 Ga. 421, 60 S.E. 1056 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Comparative negligence charge does not exclude defense that plaintiff's negligence greater.</b> - Where a trial judge charged the jury in substance that where both parties were negligent, but the plaintiff could not have avoided injury by the exercise of ordinary care, and the defendant's was greater than that of the plaintiff, that the rule of comparative negligence and consequent diminution of damages was applicable, this instruction did not exclude the defense that the plaintiff's injury was brought about by plaintiff's own failure to exercise ordinary care.

<p class="p4"><b>Cases before 1929 of no benefit.</b> - Cases decided before 1929 are of no benefit in determining where the burden of proof rests after the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction with former Code 1933, </b><span class="s1"><b>§§</b></span><b> 18-607 and </b>68-710. - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 18-607, 68-710 and 94-1108 were construed alike since they contained almost the exact same language and they were intended to operate only when the facts in a case were not or could not be produced, in which event the burden was upon the railroad or bus company to produce the facts which were, as a general rule, peculiarly within its knowledge. An instruction upon the principle embraced in these sections ought not to be given where the testimony in the case sufficiently explained every material fact connected with the infliction of the injury; and these sections have served their purpose when they compel the railroad or bus company to explain how the injury occurred; and that the question of negligence or no negligence was to be decided from the facts in the case. Scott v. Torrance, 69 Ga. App. 309, 25 S.E.2d 120 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of negligence repealed.</b> - The legal presumption of negligence against a carrier was codified, found unconstitutional, recodified as a burden-shifting standard and, as to buses for hire, subsequently repealed by Ga. L. 1992, p. 1179, <span class="s1">§</span> 1; therefore, the presumption is no longer valid. Adams v. MARTA, 246 Ga. App. 698, 542 S.E.2d 130 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of section to actions in justice of the peace courts.</b> - Although the strictness of pleading necessary in action in the superior and city courts is not required in justice of the peace courts, nevertheless, where an action is brought in a justice of the peace court against a railroad company for the killing of livestock, it is essential that the plaintiff should, at least in general terms, allege that the killing was the result of the negligence of the defendant company, the presumption of negligence which the law raises against a railroad company being a rule of evidence, and not of pleading, applicable as such to all actions brought against railroad companies for damage sustained by the running of their engines, cars, or other machinery.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rule of evidence under this section exists in favor of plaintiff.</b> - In an action against a railroad for damages because of injury sustained by the running of its train there existed a rule of evidence in favor of the plaintiff in the beginning of plaintiff's case which did not apply against defendants in general; this provision was found in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292).

<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of liability of railroad arises where injury caused by operation of trains.</b> - When it is proved that the damage was occasioned because of the operation of trains, the presumption arises that the railroad company is liable, but the railroad company may rebut this presumption by introducing evidence to show that it was not liable; the burden of procedure is shifted from the plaintiff to the railroad company. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Hester, 94 Ga. App. 226, 94 S.E.2d 124 (1956). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Until the defendant puts in some evidence, the presumption continued in force and was a positive aid to the plaintiff's case. Ellis v. Southern Ry., 89 Ga. App. 407, 79 S.E.2d 541 (1953), later appeal, 99 Ga. App. 687, 101 S.E.2d 230 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Initial burden placed on railroad.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292 places the initial burden of production on the railroad to prove all facts that are peculiarly within the railroad's knowledge.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of injury alone sufficient to carry case to jury.</b> - If the plaintiff introduces no evidence tending to support the allegations of negligence contained in the petition, the proof of injury from the operation of the train would be sufficient to carry the case to the jury unless the plaintiff's evidence showed nonliability on the part of the defendant as a matter of law. Fowler v. Western &amp; Atl. R.R., 75 Ga. App. 156, 42 S.E.2d 499 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No prima facie case where no proof that injury caused by running of train.</b> - Under Ga. L. 1929, p. 315, <span class="s1">§</span> 1 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) proof of an injury is prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the railroad company only in a case where such injury is inflicted by the running of a locomotive or cars of such company. If the proof does not disclose that the injury was inflicted by the running of a locomotive or cars of the company, then there is no prima facie evidence of want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the company.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant may prove negligence by showing plaintiff's lack of ordinary care.</b> - If the plaintiff sets up in the petition other allegations of negligence than the mere fact that the damage was occasioned by other acts of negligence than the operation of its trains, the defendant must in some way put up evidence in its behalf to show that the defendant is not liable for any reason which it may show; among those reasons is that even though the defendant was negligent in some manner or other of the acts of negligence alleged by the plaintiff, nevertheless the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, because by the exercise of ordinary care plaintiff could have avoided the negligence of the defendant.

<p class="p4"><b>Burden on railroad to produce evidence countering prima facie case.</b> - Former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) casts upon railway company burden of producing some evidence contrary to prima facie case; and when that was done the inference was at an end.

<p class="p4"><b>Section's purpose served when railroad has explained cause of injury.</b> - The inference created by a prima facie proof of injury by the running of railroad cars is at an end and vanishes when the railroad company produces some evidence to the contrary. In such a situation former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) had served its purpose when the railroad was compelled to explain how the injury occurred and the question of negligence or nonnegligence was to be decided by the entire facts of the case. Then the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the negligence of the defendant was the proximate cause of the alleged injury. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Rowe, 83 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Prima facie presumption rebutted with positive evidence to the contrary.</b> - Where as a result of proved facts, only a prima facie presumption arises that certain additional facts exist in favor of one party, and positive, unequivocal, and uncontradicted testimony is introduced in behalf of the other party, emphatically denying the facts thus presumed, such presumption is legally rebutted and cannot prevail against such testimony. Floyd v. Colonial Stores, Inc., 121 Ga. App. 852, 176 S.E.2d 111 (1970). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">By showing that plaintiff's mule was killed by the operation of train, plaintiff successfully invoked the prima facie presumption of want of reasonable skill and care afforded by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292); but the inference created by proof of injury by the running of the defendants' train came to an end when defendants produced evidence to the contrary, and the burden then fell on the plaintiff to make out a case without any aid from that section.

<p class="p4"><b>Inference terminated where defendant carrier has produced contrary evidence.</b> - The purpose of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 68-710 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) was to create an inference and cast upon the defendant carrier the duty of producing some evidence to the contrary, and when that was done the inference was at an end and the question of negligence became one for the jury upon all the evidence.

<p class="p4">The presumptions of negligence against a carrier towards a passenger who is injured by a carrier in the running of its train vanishes upon the introduction by the defendant of testimony in rebuttal of such presumption, and the question of negligence is then for the jury. The burden then rests upon the plaintiff to establish the alleged negligence by a preponderance of the evidence. Alabama G.S.R.R. v. McBryar, 65 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Rule is applicable only where defendant rebuts each act of negligence alleged.</b> - The rule that when the railroad company introduced evidence that its employees were not negligent in the operation of the train the presumption under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) disappeared was only applicable when the defendant's testimony showed that the trainmen were not guilty of any of the acts of negligence alleged in the petition and relied on by the plaintiff as the basis of recovery.

<p class="p4"><b>Contrary evidence may show exercise of reasonable skill and care by railroad.</b> - The presumption afforded by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292 is a rebuttable presumption and disappears when the railroad company introduces evidence showing the exercise of reasonable care and skill, that is, ordinary care, by its employees in the operation of the train at the time and place in question.

<p class="p4">This is a rule of evidence, and the presumption thus created is overcome by the introduction of evidence of the exercise of reasonable care and skill on the part of the servants of the railroad at the time and place in question, and such evidence is controlling, if not discredited or contradicted, in the absence of any evidence of negligence on the part of such servants at the time and place in question.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of evidence shifting back to plaintiff.</b> - When the railroad offers opposing evidence as to each act of alleged negligence the statutory presumption immediately vanishes, and the plaintiff must go forward with the evidence if any more is needed to establish a preponderance of the evidence. Plaintiff does this, not because the burden of proof has been shifted to plaintiff, since such a burden never left plaintiff from the beginning of the case, but because the burden of evidence was shifted back to plaintiff. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Thomas, 83 Ga. App. 477, 64 S.E.2d 301 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The prima facie presumption of want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of railroad companies which arises upon proof of injury inflicted by the running of their locomotives or cars disappears upon the introduction of some evidence showing absence of such negligence.

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence introduced by railroad cannot be arbitrarily disregarded.</b> - This rule is merely a rule of evidence, so that the presumption thus created is overcome by the introduction by the railroad company of evidence of the exercise by it or its servants operating the train of reasonable skill and care in the performance of their duties at the particular time and place in question. Such evidence on behalf of the railroad cannot arbitrarily be disregarded in the absence of any evidence to discredit or contradict it. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Hodges, 79 Ga. App. 563, 54 S.E.2d 500 (1949); Wright v. Central of Ga. Ry., 85 Ga. App. 654, 69 S.E.2d 902 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence introduced by railroad is controlling if not contradicted.</b> - Where it is shown that injury was inflicted by the running of a railroad train, a presumption of negligence arises against the railroad, but the presumption is overcome by evidence on behalf of the railroad showing the exercise of ordinary and reasonable care and skill, and, in the absence of any evidence to discredit or contradict this evidence, or showing negligence on the part of servants of the railroad, it is controlling, and a verdict for the plaintiff is unauthorized. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Martin, 79 Ga. App. 194, 53 S.E.2d 176 (1949); Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Clemmons, 87 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Case to be decided on facts alone after presumption rebutted.</b> - Where testimony is introduced tending to explain every material fact connected with the infliction of the injury, and to rebut every allegation of negligence, the presumption is dead, and the case is to be decided upon its facts alone. Louisville &amp; N.R.R. v. Bennett, 89 Ga. App. 534, 80 S.E.2d 195 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Question of negligence is for jury from all evidence.</b> - Proof of injury inflicted by the running of a locomotive or cars of a railroad company is prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the company, and proof thereof casts upon the railroad company the burden of producing some evidence to the contrary; and when this is done the inference is at an end, and the question of negligence is one for the jury from all the evidence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assumption of risk.</b> - Evidence adduced by the railroad rebutted the presumption of negligence granted by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292, where decedent's actions in going upon a trestle and relying on a water barrel stand as a place of safety in the event a train passed constituted assumption of the risk and would bar recovery. Munger v. Central R.R. Co., 199 Ga. App. 301, 404 S.E.2d 647 (1991), cert. denied, 199 Ga. App. 906, 404 S.E.2d 647 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Presumption overcome by testimony of only eyewitnesses.</b> - Presumption of negligence on the part of the defendant railroad created by proof that the plaintiff's cattle were killed by the running of defendant's train, was entirely overcome and rebutted by the defendant when it introduced the testimony of the engineer and firemen of the train, who were the only eyewitnesses to the killing, and this clearly and sufficiently explained every material fact connected with the killing.

<p class="p4"><b>Presumption overcome by testimony that weather too foggy to avoid injury.</b> - Where relying entirely upon the presumption of negligence against railroad companies the plaintiff shows that one of plaintiff's cows had been killed by the defendant company's train, and the presumption is overcome by the uncontradicted evidence of the engineer that the weather was so foggy that it was impossible for the engineer to have seen the animal in time to avoid killing it, in the absence of anything to discredit or contradict such evidence a verdict was demanded for the railroad company.

<p class="p4"><b>Dog found dead near railroad tracks does not imply dog killed by train.</b> - Evidence that the plaintiff's dog was found lying dead about ten feet from the defendant's railroad track, that there were no marks or lacerations on the dog, but the slag along said railroad looked as though something had been knocked or dragged over it, was insufficient to authorize the inference that the dog was killed by the operation of one of the defendant's trains.

Alabama G.S.R.R. v. McBryar, 65 Ga. App. 153, 15 S.E.2d 563 (1941) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 18-607).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No error in failing to charge section where presumption rebutted.</b> - It is not error for the court to fail to charge the jury on the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) where the defendant railroad company introduced evidence in rebuttal of plaintiff's allegations of negligence, and to charge that the burden of proof rested on the plaintiff to prove the essential allegations of the complaint.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to charge section not error where inference rebutted.</b> - Where there was any evidence tending to rebut the inference raised by the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 68-710 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) failure to charge its provisions was not error.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to charge on presumption of section where presumption rebutted.</b> - In an action against a railroad company for damages to persons or property resulting from the running of its locomotives or cars, the inference created by proof of injury so inflicted was at an end when the company introduced evidence in rebuttal of the plaintiff's allegations of negligence; and it was then reversible error for the court to charge the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292).

<p class="p4">When all of the facts touching the injury inflicted were in evidence, both from the testimony of the plaintiff and of the defendant, the court should not give former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) in charge to the jury.

<p class="p4">Where the defendant introduced evidence sufficient to authorize a finding of its exercise of ordinary care under the circumstances and introduced material facts connected with the collision, the principle set out in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 94-1108 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-8-292) had no place and court erred in charging thereon.

<p class="p4">In an action for damages against railway company for the killing of plaintiff's cow by defendant's locomotive, where the defendant introduced testimony as to the manner in which the cow was killed, the presumption of negligence ceased to exist and should not have been given in the charge to the jury.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to charge that burden is on defendant to show no liability.</b> - Where the plaintiff relies entirely upon the presumption of negligence arising against railroad companies by proof of injury to persons or property by the running of the defendant's trains or cars, and the defendant introduces evidence which the jury would be authorized to find exonerates the defendant, it is error to charge the jury that the burden is upon the defendant to show that the railroad company was not liable, that is, that the servants or employees of the company exercised all due and ordinary care and diligence on their part. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Sears, 80 Ga. App. 338, 56 S.E.2d 130 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Error to require defendant to show exercise of ordinary care by preponderance of evidence.</b> - Where the defendant railroad company has produced some evidence contrary to each of the alleged acts of negligence testified to on behalf of the plaintiff, it is reversible error, in the absence of corrective instructions elsewhere in the charge, for the court to charge the jury that when it is shown that livestock is killed by the railroad company that the burden shifts to the defendant railroad company to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it has exercised ordinary care and diligence to prevent the injury and damage.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How error in charging section may be cured.</b> - Error committed by court in charging in effect that injury inflicted by locomotive is presumed to have been caused by railroad's negligence, although railroad's evidence destroyed such presumption, may be cured where there is an express withdrawal by the court of that portion of the charge in another part thereof, but it is not cured merely by further explanation to the effect that, when railroad introduces evidence as to its manner of running its locomotives and cars, the question of negligence is then to be decided upon its facts.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Considerations</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Federal preemption.</b> - The Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 11707(a)(1), preempts state law remedies against common carriers for negligent loss or damages to goods shipped under a lawful bill of lading. Joseph Land &amp; Co. v. Christopher Edwards Cos., 211 Ga. App. 597, 440 S.E.2d 234 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Extraordinary diligence" defined.</b> - Extraordinary diligence is defined as that extreme care and caution which very prudent and thoughtful persons use under like circumstances. Richmond &amp; D.R.R. v. White &amp; Co., 88 Ga. 805, 15 S.E. 802 (1892); Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Jacobs' Pharmacy Co., 135 Ga. 113, 68 S.E. 1039 (1910). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Rule of extraordinary diligence imposed upon common carriers by former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2263 and 2264 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1), required the exercise of that degree of diligence to avoid needlessly exposing goods to injury or destruction by an unforseen act of God, such as an extraordinary flood or freshet, and also to protect and preserve the goods after the peril became apparent. Richmond &amp; D.R.R. v. White &amp; Co., 88 Ga. 805, 15 S.E. 802 (1892).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Loss" construed.</b> - "Loss," as used in former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2065 and 2066 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1), included injury or damage to the goods. Central R.R. v. Hasselkus &amp; Stewart, 91 Ga. 382, 17 S.E. 838, 44 Am. St. R. 37 (1892).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Common carrier distinguished from ordinary carrier.</b> - A carrier was bound to exercise ordinary diligence while a common carrier was bound to use extraordinary diligence under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2711 and 2712 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1). Western &amp; A.R.R. v. Waldrip, 18 Ga. App. 263, 89 S.E. 346 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Private carrier held to ordinary diligence.</b> - Person undertaking to transport goods as private carrier and not as a common carrier is bound only to ordinary diligence. Bloomberg-Michael Furn. Co. v. Urquhart, 38 Ga. App. 304, 143 S.E. 789 (1928).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Private carrier is liable for willful tort of its servant.</b> - A carrier is absolutely liable for the willful tort of its servant against a passenger, even where the carrier was a private carrier and was thus held only to the duty of reasonable care for the passenger's protection against the carrier's negligence. Bricks v. Metro Ambulance Serv., Inc., 177 Ga. App. 62, 338 S.E.2d 438 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Common carrier's absolute liability as insurer.</b> - Law fixes upon common carrier absolute liability as insurer, from which it may free itself only by showing that the loss or damage was occasioned by "the act of God or the public enemies of the state." Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Henry Chanin Corp., 84 Ga. App. 442, 66 S.E.2d 113 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier of passengers to exercise extraordinary care for passenger's safety.</b> - While carrier of passengers is not insurer in sense as common carrier of goods, the carrier is bound to exercise extraordinary care and diligence for the safety of the carrier's passengers, and it matters not the kind of conveyance used or the nature of the motive power employed. Sheffield v. Lovering, 51 Ga. App. 353, 180 S.E. 523 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rule requiring exercise of extraordinary care applicable to partial loss.</b> - The rule under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2711 and 2712 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1) which placed upon a common carrier the burden of showing the exercise of extraordinary diligence in the transportation of goods applied not only in cases of total loss, but also in case of partial loss by injury or damage to the goods from delay in transportation or delivery, and required that extraordinary diligence shall be shown as to the time of completing this service. Southern Cotton-Oil Co. v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., 15 Ga. App. 751, 84 S.E. 198 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General grounds of common carrier's liability.</b> - When a carrier fails to deliver the goods intrusted to the carrier's care, or delivers them in a damaged condition, no excuse avails the carrier, unless it was occasioned by the act of God, the public enemy, an inherent vice or natural deterioration of the object carried, or, in case of livestock, the viciousness of the animals, or that the carrier is excused by special contract made with the shipper, by statute, or by negligence of the shipper. Hines v. Vann, 26 Ga. App. 704, 106 S.E. 921 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Goods seized under legal process.</b> - If goods are seized and taken from the carrier's possession under legal process, its liability ceases. Savannah, G. &amp; N.A.R.R. v. Wilcox, Gibbs &amp; Co., 48 Ga. 432 (1873). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If delivery by the carrier has been prevented and rendered impossible by the seizure of the shipment in the enforcement by properly constituted legal officials of existing laws, the carrier is bound not to violate the law by making delivery of the goods which have been seized by properly authorized officers. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Evans, 172 Ga. 53, 157 S.E. 313 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acts of God</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Act of God" distinguished from unavoidable accident.</b> - There is, doubtless, a distinction between an act of God and an unavoidable accident. The former covers only natural accidents, such as lightning, earthquakes, tempests, and the like, and not accidents arising from the negligence or act of man. Harmony Grove Tel. Co. v. Potts, 24 Ga. App. 178, 100 S.E. 236 (1919).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Act of God" includes unavoidable accidents.</b> - For decisions holding that "act of God" includes unavoidable accidents, see Fish v. Chapman &amp; Ross, 2 Ga. 349 (1847); Central of Ga. Ry. v. Council Bros., 36 Ga. App. 573, 137 S.E. 569, cert. denied, 36 Ga. App. 825,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>S.E.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier utilizing act of God exception.</b> - In order for carrier to avail oneself of act of God exception, the carrier must establish not only that the act of God ultimately occasioned the loss, but that the carrier's own negligence did not contribute thereto. Loo-Mac Freight Lines v. American Type Founders, Inc., 100 Ga. App. 203, 110 S.E.2d 566 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Carrier as Insurer</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conditions precedent to common carrier's liability.</b> - The liability of the common carrier in case of loss, for which there is no excuse unless the loss was occasioned by the act of God or the public enemies of the state, exists only, in the absence of an express or implied contract to the contrary, when the carrier is in complete possession and control of the goods for immediate shipment with nothing remaining to be done by the shipper to complete the consignment to the shipper for the purpose of carriage, and only until the goods are delivered to their destination and notice given to the consignee. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Point at which common carrier's responsibility as insurer commences.</b> - Responsibility of common carrier as insurer under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 18-102 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1) commenced where there has been a complete delivery for the purpose of immediate transportation. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability of carrier where shipper requests delay of shipment.</b> - If shipment is delayed by request of shipper, liability of carrier is only that of warehouseman during such delay, and carrier cannot be charged with the loss of the goods if, while they were in the carrier's custody pending instruction from the shipper, the carrier exercised ordinary care. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier liable only as warehouseman where goods stored only to accommodate shipper.</b> - If a common carrier receives goods into the carrier's own warehouse for the accommodation of oneself and one's customers, so that the deposit there is a mere accessory to the carriage and for the purpose of facilitating it, the carrier's liability as a carrier will commence with the receipt of the goods; but, on the contrary, if the goods when so deposited are not ready for immediate transportation, and the carrier cannot make arrangements for their carriage to the place of destination until something further is done, or some further direction is given or communication made concerning them by the owner, or consignor, the deposit must be considered to be in the meantime for the carrier's convenience and accommodation, and the receiver, until some change takes place, will be responsible only as a warehouseman. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Shipper seeking damages must show carelessness or negligence by carrier.</b> - Shipper seeking to recover damages of common carrier must show some injury which cannot be the result of inherent nature or defects of goods shipped, or some carelessness or negligence on the part of the carrier likely to cause the injury, before the burden is cast on the carrier to show that the carrier is not in fault. Hussey v. Saragossa, 12 F. Cas. 1066 (S.D. Ga. 1876). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To make out case for damage to goods, the shipper need only show the delivery in good condition and the receipt in damaged condition; the carrier, to make good the carrier's defense must then show that the damage arose from causes unmixed with any negligence on the carrier's part. Loo-Mac Freight Lines v. American Type Founders, Inc., 100 Ga. App. 203, 110 S.E.2d 566 (1959); Empire Aluminum Corp. v. SS Korendijk, 391 F. Supp. 402 (S.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Establishing prima facie case against delivering carrier.</b> - Prima facie case against delivering carrier is shown by alleging the delivery of the goods or merchandise shipped in good order to the initial carrier and receipt at the destination from the terminal carrier of the goods in a damaged condition. Empire Aluminum Corp. v. SS Korendijk, 391 F. Supp. 402 (S.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ending responsibility as delivering carrier.</b> - Because the injured party was injured when a container that had held hazardous materials exploded, the carrier that had delivered the container hours earlier was not liable as an insurer under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1, as the injured party was not an owner of the goods. Booth v. Quality Carriers, Inc., 276 Ga. App. 406, 623 S.E.2d 244 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Proof of receipt in good order and delivery in damaged condition shifts burden to carrier.</b> - Proof of receipt in good order and delivery in damaged condition casts burden on common carrier of establishing an affirmative defense. Empire Aluminum Corp. v. SS Korendijk, 391 F. Supp. 402 (S.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Shipper must show receipt in good order where condition of goods not apparent.</b> - Where real condition of goods is not apparent, carrier is not liable except upon a showing by shipper that they were in fact in good order when delivered. Empire Aluminum Corp. v. SS Korendijk, 391 F. Supp. 402 (S.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption that goods received in good order.</b> - Where it does not appear carrier received goods in bad order, presumption is that they were in good order. Empire Aluminum Corp. v. SS Korendijk, 391 F. Supp. 402 (S.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption that goods received back by shipper are in good order.</b> - There is presumption that goods received are received back by shipper in good order when the contrary does not affirmatively appear. Loo-Mac Freight Lines v. American Type Founders, Inc., 100 Ga. App. 203, 110 S.E.2d 566 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier not liable for theft of goods still in customers' exclusive control.</b> - Where customers' jewelry was never delivered to defendant, a moving company, for transportation, but remained in the exclusive control of the customers until the time of its theft, allegedly by the defendant's employee, the carrier did not owe its customers a duty of extraordinary diligence to protect the jewelry and is not absolutely liable to them for the alleged theft. Effort Enters., Inc. v. Crosta, 194 Ga. App. 666, 391 S.E.2d 477 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Last carrier presumed responsible for damage absent evidence to contrary.</b> - In the absence of evidence locating the place of damage to goods in transit over several connecting lines, the presumption is that where goods are delivered to an initial carrier in good condition and are delivered by the terminal carrier in a damaged condition, that they were injured on the line of the last carrier, and the burden of proof is on the terminal carrier, when sued, to show that the damage was not done on its line. Empire Aluminum Corp. v. SS Korendijk, 391 F. Supp. 402 (S.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contributory negligence of shipper.</b> - The presumption of liability raised by former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2263 and 2264 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1) may be rebutted, if it appeared that the injury was caused by the plaintiff personally, whether the act which caused the injury be due to negligence or design. In other words, the provisions of that section have no reference to a case where the loss was attributable, either in whole or in part, to the act of the shipper personally. Southern Ry. v. Morrison, 105 Ga. 543, 31 S.E. 564 (1898); Coweta County v. Central of Ga. Ry., 4 Ga. App. 94, 60 S.E. 1018 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Carrier claiming negligence by shipper must show the carrier's own lack of fault.</b> - If a common carrier relies upon the defense that the loss was occasioned by the fault of the shipper or the shipper's agent, the carrier must bring oneself within the defense by negativing contributing fault on the carrier's own part. Bugg v. Perry &amp; Faircloth, 42 Ga. App. 523, 156 S.E. 708 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where it appears that the injury resulted solely from the fault of the shipper in improperly packing the merchandise the rule is that if the defendant defends on the ground that the shipper is guilty of negligence in improper packing, the burden is on the carrier not only to show that the loss was occasioned by such fault on the part of the shipper but the carrier must negative any contributing fault on the carrier's own part. Loo-Mac Freight Lines v. American Type Founders, Inc., 100 Ga. App. 203, 110 S.E.2d 566 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carriers not liable for damages due to intrinsic qualities of goods carried.</b> - Injury from inherent qualities is somewhat in nature of damages resulting from act of God; and in the more recent development of the rules as to the liability of carriers it has been held that they are not liable for loss or damage due to the intrinsic qualities of the goods carried. Forrester v. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking, 92 Ga. 699, 19 S.E. 811 (1893); Susong v. Florida C. &amp; P.R.R., 115 Ga. 361, 41 S.E. 566 (1902); Ohlen v. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R., 2 Ga. App. 323, 58 S.E. 511 (1907); Capital City Oil Co. v. Central of Ga. Ry., 16 Ga. App. 750, 86 S.E. 57 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier may assert defense of inherent defects in goods.</b> - The carrier's right of defense for a failure to deliver goods of a perishable nature entrusted to the carrier's care, or where the carrier delivered them in a damaged condition, has been so enlarged that the carrier may show that the damage was occasioned by an inherent vice or natural deterioration in the goods. Bugg v. Perry &amp; Faircloth, 42 Ga. App. 523, 156 S.E. 708 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier must show lack of negligence where inherent defect claimed as defense.</b> - When goods, though perishable or liable to rapidly deteriorate from internal causes, are damaged while in the hands of the carrier, the burden of proof is upon the carrier to show either that the carrier was free from negligence, or that notwithstanding the carrier's negligence the damage occurred without the carrier's fault; that is, that the carrier's negligence did not contribute to the damage. Central R.R. v. Hasselkus &amp; Stewart, 91 Ga. 382, 17 S.E. 838, 44 Am. St. R. 37 (1892); Southern Express Co. v. Bailey, 7 Ga. App. 331, 66 S.E. 960 (1910). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There is a defense of inherent vice but the burden of establishing it is on the defendant and the defendant must affirmatively show that the damage resulted from such inherent vice unmixed with defendant's own negligence. Loo-Mac Freight Lines v. American Type Founders, Inc., 100 Ga. App. 203, 110 S.E.2d 566 (1959). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Carrier's duty to show bad condition of goods delivered.</b> - It is carrier's duty to show that goods were in bad condition when delivered to the carrier. Empire Aluminum Corp. v. SS Korendijk, 391 F. Supp. 402 (S.D. Ga. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier's duty to advise shipper as to transportation delays.</b> - Carrier has duty to advise shipper as to any cause likely to delay transportation of which it knows or has reason to know, and if it fails in its duty in this respect, a delay in the transportation of the goods will not be excused, and that too irrespective of the nature of the cause. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. South Ga. Milling Co., 44 Ga. App. 316, 161 S.E. 282 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumptions and burden of proof.</b> - In case of loss the presumption was against the carrier under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§§</span> 2263 and 2264 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-1). The burden, however, is on the plaintiff to show the loss; but for the purposes of a prima facie case this may be done by showing such circumstances as would create the inference against the defendant that the goods were lost; as, for instance, they were bailed to the carrier a sufficient length of time to be transported to destination and have not arrived there. Southern Ry. v. Montag, 1 Ga. App. 649, 57 S.E. 933 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Extraordinary negligence presents jury question.</b> - In determining what very prudent and thoughtful persons would do under certain circumstances, the situation and surrounding facts, including the existence of an emergency, if there was one, are to be considered by the jury. Richmond &amp; D.R.R. v. White &amp; Co., 88 Ga. 805, 15 S.E. 802 (1892); Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v.

Central of Ga. Ry. v. Hall, 124 Ga. 322, 52 S.E. 679, 110 Am. St. R. 170, 4 L.R.A. (n.s.) 898, 4 Ann. Cas. 128 (1905); Georgia S. &amp; F. Ry. v. Greer, 2 Ga. App. 516, 58 S.E. 782 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meaning of "except for its negligence" in contract.</b> - The use of the words "except for its negligence," in a contract, meant the negligence contemplated by former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2726 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2), which was the failure to exercise extraordinary care. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. McLemore, 45 Ga. App. 154, 164 S.E. 464 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Usage or course of dealing may imply duty of safe-keeping.</b> - Contract imposing upon carrier exclusive duty of safe-keeping may be implied by usage or a particular course of dealing between the parties; but the implication that the carrier assumes the duty of immediate transportation and so responsibility as an insurer, without knowing to what place and to whom goods are to be shipped, must be clear. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reduced rate as consideration for special contract.</b> - A contract for carriage, limiting the liability of a carrier in consideration of a reduced rate, is valid and binding. Western &amp; A.R.R. v. Waldrip, 18 Ga. App. 263, 89 S.E. 346 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier may not contract exemption from liability due to own negligence.</b> - Common carrier cannot, by special contract, exempt oneself from liability for loss occasioned by the carrier's own negligence. Berry v. Cooper &amp; Boykin, 28 Ga. 543 (1859); Purcell v. Southern Express Co., 34 Ga. 315 (1866); Georgia R.R. v. Gann &amp; Reaves, 68 Ga. 350 (1882). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While a common carrier may by special contract based upon a sufficient consideration modify or limit the carrier's common-law liability in the transportation of freight, the carrier cannot make a valid contract exempting oneself altogether from negligence. Bugg v. Perry &amp; Faircloth, 42 Ga. App. 523, 156 S.E. 708 (1931). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A railroad company was under the duty, as a common carrier, of exercising diligence in transporting goods; and although it may relieve itself from its liability as an insurer of such goods, it was well established that it may not, by special contract under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2276 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2), limit or procure release from its liability for negligence in so doing.

<p class="p4">An express contract entered into by the carrier and the passenger, under the terms of which the carrier is released from all liability to the passenger for personal injuries received while a passenger on a freight train, is in effect a contract by which the carrier undertakes to relieve itself from the consequences of the negligence of itself and servants, and cannot be enforced. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Lippman, 110 Ga. 665, 36 S.E. 202, 50 L.R.A. 673 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Arbitrary limitation as to amount recoverable impermissible.</b> - While a bona fide agreement may be made as to the value of property to be transported, as a basis for fixing the charges, and may be valid, yet a common carrier cannot, even by express contract, put an arbitrary limitation upon its liability for damages. Such a contract is contrary to public policy. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Hall, 124 Ga. 322, 52 S.E. 679, 110 Am. St. R. 170, 4 L.R.A. (n.s.) 898, 4 Ann. Cas. 128 (1905); Southern Express Co. v. Hanaw, 134 Ga. 445, 67 S.E. 944, 137 Am. St. R. 227 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Value of goods stipulated in carrier's receipt not binding upon owner.</b> - Stipulation in receipt given by carrier as to value of goods is not binding upon the owner unless expressly agreed to by the owner; and in the event of a breach of the contract of carriage by the carrier, the owner is entitled to recover full damages as shown by the evidence, regardless of such statement as to the value of the goods. Southern Express Co. v. Briggs, 1 Ga. App. 294, 57 S.E. 1066 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract must be independent of receipt.</b> - The express contract made with the shipper of the goods, limiting the legal liability of the common carrier under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2042 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2), must be made independently of the receipt given for the goods, and be proved independently thereof, as any other contract was proved, when entered into by two or more parties to it. Southern Express Co. v. Purcell, 37 Ga. 103, 92 Am. Dec. 53 (1867).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stipulation of limitation in receipt insufficient.</b> - The mere insertion, in a printed form of receipt used by an express company, of terms limiting its liability, and the delivery of such a receipt to a shipper, without more, will not under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2726 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2) suffice to make an express contract for the purpose of limiting its liability as a common carrier. Southern Express Co. v. Hanaw, 134 Ga. 445, 67 S.E. 944, 137 Am. St. R. 227 (1910). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The carrier cannot limit liability by entry on receipts given, though the carrier may make an express contract. Former Code 1863, <span class="s1">§</span> 2041 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2) was intended to require the assent of the shipper to be given to any modification of the common law contract of common carriers. Southern Express Co. v. Newby, 36 Ga. 635, 91 Am. Dec. 783 (1867). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A stipulation in a receipt, not known to the shipper, given to the shipper by an agent of an express company, does not limit the company's liability as a common carrier. Mosher &amp; Co. v. Southern Express Co., 38 Ga. 37 (1868).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reference in receipt to provision in bill of lading.</b> - The inclusion in a receipt given by a compress company to the owner of cotton of a provision that it was "subject to all the conditions of bill of lading of the carrier, which may be issued in exchange for this receipt," and the existence in the printed conditions on the back of the bill of lading of a statement that "No carrier or party in possession of all or any of the cotton hereby described shall be liable for any loss therefor or damage thereto by . . . fire," did not constitute such an express contract between the shipper and carrier as to relieve the latter from liability for loss occurring by fire. Atlantic Compress Co. v. Central of Ga. Ry., 135 Ga. 140, 68 S.E. 1028 (1910); Seaboard Air-Line Ry. v. Atlantic Compress Co., 135 Ga. 413, 69 S.E. 566 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Carrier cannot limit liability by notice of special acceptance.</b> - Carrier cannot vary the carrier's responsibility by notice or special acceptance, such being void as contravening the policy of the law. Fish v. Chapman &amp; Ross, 2 Ga. 349, 46 Am. Dec. 393 (1847). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Liability of carrier cannot be limited by mere notice in bill of lading; but if a special contract be incorporated in the bill of lading, and signed by both parties, it is sufficient. Georgia R.R. v. Spears, 66 Ga. 485, 42 Am. R. 81 (1881); Georgia R.R. v. Gann &amp; Reaves, 68 Ga. 350 (1882). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2068 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2), a carrier could not limit its liability by inserting in a bill of lading a provision that, for all loss or damage occurring in the transit, the legal remedy should be sought and held only against the particular carrier in whose custody the cotton might be at the time thereof, there being no express contract to that effect, the bill of lading being signed only by the agent of the company, and not having been agreed to by the shipper. Central R.R. v. Dwight Mfg. Co., 75 Ga. 609 (1885).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assent of shipper necessary to limitation placed in bill of lading.</b> - A stipulation in a bill of lading which exempted the carrier from liability unless notice was given of the damage within a specified time, was one of the matters forbidden by former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2068 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2), and was not effectual without proof of assent thereto by the shipper. Central R.R. v. Hasselkus &amp; Stewart, 91 Ga. 382, 17 S.E. 838, 44 Am. St. R. 37 (1892); McElveen &amp; Hardage v. Southern Ry., 109 Ga. 249, 34 S.E. 281, 77 Am. St. R. 371 (1899).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Signature of shipper.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2276 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2) a provision of the bill of lading that the railroad should only be liable for the safe delivery of the goods to its connecting carrier was without effect to relieve it from liability for damage to the goods while in the possession of the connecting carrier, unless such bill of lading was signed by the shipper. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Kavanaugh, 92 F. 56 (5th Cir. 1899). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where bill of lading attached to the plaintiff's petition shows that it was signed by the carrier's agent alone, and not by the shipper, the plaintiff was not bound by any stipulation therein by which it was sought to limit the liability of the carrier. Lamb v. McHan, 17 Ga. App. 5, 86 S.E. 252 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Using entry on ticket for making of express contract.</b> - Entry on ticket that it must be used within time specified did not make express contract under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2276 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2), unless the purchaser at the time the ticket was delivered knew of the entry and assented to its terms.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption against carrier.</b> - Where there was a special contract shown, limiting the liability of the carrier of live stock, where the plaintiff proved that the stock was lost or injured while in the possession of the carrier, the law would raise a presumption of negligence against the carrier, which must be rebutted by proof showing the exercise of that degree of diligence required by the contract. Georgia S. &amp; F. Ry. v. Greer, 2 Ga. App. 516, 58 S.E. 782 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Shipper's burden of proof as to liability.</b> - Where a shipper signed a contract under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2276 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2) limiting the liability of the common carrier and reciting that it was made in consideration of a reduced rate of freight, such recital was prima facie true, and the burden was upon the shipper to prove the contrary. Georgia S. &amp; F. Ry. v. Greer, 2 Ga. App. 516, 58 S.E. 782 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of parol evidence to show special contract.</b> - Parol evidence was admissible to show special contract between a shipper and a common carrier under former Code 1863, <span class="s1">§</span> 2041 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2), notwithstanding the carrier's clerk had given a receipt, specifying the terms on which the freight was received.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitation of liability of livestock carrier by special contract.</b> - Common carrier of livestock may limit the carrier's liability by special contract, as recognized in former Code 1873, <span class="s1">§</span> 2068 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-2).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Baggage.</b> - Where the evidence showed that the plaintiff had entered into an express contract in which it was agreed that the defendant would not be liable for loss of baggage beyond its own line, and that the baggage alleged to have been lost was delivered by the defendant to the connecting line, and not returned to the defendant, a recovery for the plaintiff was unwarranted.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agent delivering property to carrier.</b> - If the agent delivers the property in the agent's own name and the principal is undisclosed, the latter is bound by any special contract, but if the company receives the goods as those of the principal, and, without the knowledge or consent of the latter, the carrier attempts to make a special contract with the agent, the principal is not bound thereby, unless the principal does some act from which the law infers a ratification.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent.</b> - It was to meet conditions arising from emergency, no doubt, that the legislature provided in former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2631 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-20), that the "commission shall, from time to time, and as often as the circumstances may require, change and revise such schedules" of rates. City of Atlanta v. Atlanta Gas-Light Co., 149 Ga. 405, 100 S.E. 439 (1919).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts have no power to control and make rates.</b> - Making and controlling utility rates is legislative function delegated to quasi-legislative body and the Georgia courts have no power to control and make such rates. DeKalb County v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 358 F. Supp. 498 (N.D. Ga. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 700 (5th Cir. 1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rate-making power rests exclusively in Public Service Commission.</b> - The power to make intrastate rates in Georgia has frequently been held to be the exclusive prerogative of the Public Service Commission. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Lumberman's Co., 168 Ga. 851, 149 S.E. 128 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Establishment of rate by commission carries weight of legislative act.</b> - When commission establishes rate, such act is legislative in character, and binds all parties concerned in the same manner as if the rate had been fixed by an act of the General Assembly. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 205 Ga. 863, 55 S.E.2d 618 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rates operate prospectively and cannot be applied retroactively.</b> - Even if the commission, after fixing a rate or charge, subsequently determines that the rate was unreasonably high, it has no authority in the revision of the rate to require that refunds or reparations be made of collections under the rate which had been established. If, after fixing a rate which the commission determines to be just and reasonable, it decides that the rate is unreasonable or unjust, it has the right under the law at any time to revise or amend its rulings or orders but, like legislation in general, these revised orders look to the future, and cannot be applied retroactively. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 205 Ga. 863, 55 S.E.2d 618 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Carrier's duty to receive ordinary merchandise at full liability and at reasonable rates.</b> - Carrier was bound under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2278 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40) to receive ordinary merchandise for transportation with the full measure of liability and at reasonable rates on demand, and in case of its refusal to do so the shipper has a remedy in damages. Inman &amp; Co. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 159 F. 960 (S.D. Ga. 1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier under duty to furnish cars for usual quantity of goods.</b> - A railroad company is under a duty to provide sufficient cars for transporting, without reasonable delay, the usual and ordinary quantity of freight offered to it, or which might be ordinarily expected in its business. Wadley S. Ry. v. Kent &amp; Downs, 145 Ga. 689, 89 S.E. 765 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier not bound to anticipate unexpected increase of business.</b> - It is the duty of a railroad company to provide facilities for the transportation of goods, but this duty is not an absolute one, the company must furnish cars sufficient to transport goods offered in the usual and ordinary course of business, but it is not bound to anticipate and prepare for an unexpected press of business. Central of Ga. Ry. v. George P. Greene &amp; Co., 41 Ga. App. 794, 154 S.E. 809 (1930). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ordinarily a shipper, on reasonable demand, would be entitled to all the cars which it could promptly load with freight to be transported over the carrier's line. But that is not an absolute right, and the carrier is not liable if its failure to furnish cars was the result of sudden and great demands which it had no reason to apprehend would be made, and which it could not reasonably have been expected to meet in full. Central of Ga. Ry. v. George P. Greene &amp; Co., 41 Ga. App. 794, 154 S.E. 809 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Character of goods.</b> - There may be things of such an unusual character that a railroad company is not bound, under its general duty as a common carrier, to provide cars or special facilities for their transportation. But if in the ordinary course of its business it is accustomed to receive lumber which requires cars 40 feet in length for transportation, or holds itself out as a common carrier thereof, the duty to furnish cars for that purpose arises. Wadley S. Ry. v. Kent &amp; Downs, 145 Ga. 689, 89 S.E. 765 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier's regulations must yield to state's regulations.</b> - Power of common carrier to make reasonable regulations must yield where regulations are made by authority of state, unless they are invalid. Railroad Comm'n v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., 140 Ga. 817, 80 S.E. 327, 1915E L.R.A. 902, 1915A Ann. Cas. 1018 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Regulation requiring knowledge of goods valid.</b> - A carrier may adopt reasonable rules and regulations for the carrier's own safety and the benefit of the public, such as requiring the nature and value of the goods delivered to the carrier to be made known, and any fraudulent acts, sayings or concealments by the carrier's customers, will release the carrier from liability. Southern Express Co. v. Newby, 36 Ga. 635, 91 Am. Dec. 783 (1867).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Regulation providing for nonstoppage at certain place valid.</b> - If a railway company may under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2729 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40) make reasonable regulations in the conduct of its business, in the absence of a statute to the contrary a schedule which provided for the nonstoppage of a certain train at a particular place will not be considered unreasonable, where it appeared that other trains were scheduled to stop at such place, and it was not alleged that they did not afford adequate service. Southern Ry. v. Bailey, 143 Ga. 610, 85 S.E. 847, 1915E L.R.A. 1043 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Regulation permitting stopping only at designated places valid.</b> - In the absence of statutory prohibition or regulation, a railroad company may adopt a rule under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2729 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40), that certain passenger trains, running regularly on its road, will stop only at designated places. Southern Ry. v. Flanigan, 10 Ga. App. 745, 74 S.E. 85 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Regulation requiring reservation of ship space valid.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2729 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40) it was held that a rule that ship space must be reserved before lumber cars were switched from railroad yards to ship docks was reasonable. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Dixon, 141 Ga. 755, 82 S.E. 37 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rule stipulating no responsibility until goods received with instructions valid.</b> - A rule that no responsibility for freight would be assumed until received with proper shipping instructions and receipted for, was valid. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Smith, 31 Ga. App. 135, 120 S.E. 30 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Use of rules to relieve legal obligations impermissible.</b> - The law will not sanction any practice of a common carrier, under the guise of regulating its business, that will relieve the carrier of its legal obligation. Merchants &amp; Miners Transp. Co. v. Granger &amp; Lewis, 132 Ga. 167, 63 S.E. 700 (1909).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Invalid ordinance impermissible as excuse for nonreception of goods.</b> - A common carrier, able and accustomed to transport and deliver goods, cannot lawfully refuse to do so merely because of the passage of an invalid municipal ordinance regulating the transporting of the goods in question. Southern Express Co. v. Rose Co., 124 Ga. 581, 53 S.E. 185, 5 L.R.A. (n.s.) 619 (1906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mandamus to enforce duty of carrier.</b> - A private party may, by mandamus, enforce the performance of the public duty imposed by former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2278 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40) by a common carrier as to matters in which such party had a special interest.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Common carrier by sea may make bookings for transportation of goods.</b> - The obligation of receiving goods without preference under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2278 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40) did not inhibit common carrier by sea from making bookings, that was, from making specific arrangements for the transportation of goods by a particular vessel in advance of its sailing day, provided this privilege was indifferently extended to all patrons, or if the grant of this privilege to shippers of one commodity did not interfere with the carrier's discharge of its duty to the shippers of other commodities with respect to the receipt and transportation of goods. Ocean S.S. Co. v. Savannah Locomotive Works &amp; Supply Co., 131 Ga. 831, 63 S.E. 577, 127 Am. St. R. 265, 20 L.R.A. (n.s.) 867, 15 Ann. Cas. 1044 (1909); Merchants &amp; Miners Transp. Co. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability of carrier for conversion.</b> - Where a common carrier received goods offered under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2278 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40), the possession thereof by the person offering the same as freight being apparently rightful, though as a matter of fact it may not be actually so, the carrier will not be liable as for a conversion, in an action brought by the true owner, unless the latter intervened before the goods were delivered and demanded them or gave notice of the owner's right to the property in question and of the owner's intention to enforce it. Shellnut v. Central of Ga. Ry., 131 Ga. 404, 62 S.E. 294, 18 L.R.A. (n.s.) 494 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Jury instructions.</b> - The court having charged the jury in the language of former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2729 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-40), as to the duty of a common carrier generally, it was not error not to repeat the expression "which he is able and accustomed to carry" in other portions of the judge's charge dealing with the duty of a railroad company to furnish cars for transportation of freight without unreasonable delay. Wadley S. Ry. v. Kent &amp; Downs, 145 Ga. 689, 89 S.E. 765 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Considerations for jury.</b> - The condition of business, the demand for cars, whether usual and ordinary, or unusual and extraordinary, what the defendant had done with a view of providing facilities for the usual and ordinary demands of its business, and the ability or inability to get cars at the time in question, were facts for the consideration of the jury in determining whether the defendant had complied with its duty.

<p class="p4"><b>Reasonable time implied.</b> - Where the bills of lading are silent as to the time within which delivery was to be made, the law presumes it was to be done in a reasonable time, and parol evidence is not admissible to negative this presumption by showing that a definite and specific time was agreed upon either expressly or by implication.

<p class="p4"><b>Extraordinary diligence not required as to time of transportation.</b> - Where a common carrier receives goods for transportation and is sued for delay in delivering them, it is error to charge that the carrier is bound to extraordinary diligence as to the time of transportation.

<p class="p4"><b>Delivering carrier not liable to consignee for delays caused by consignor's instructions.</b> - Where a car of tin cans and cartons is delivered to an initial carrier which routes the car either upon its own judgment or at the direction of the consignor, a delivering carrier, other than the initial carrier, is not liable to the consignee for delay due to the routing of the car, even if the agent of the delivering carrier knew of the purpose for which the cans were needed by the consignee, and of the delay which would be caused by the routing of the car as it was routed, and even agreed with the consignee to route it so as not to cause delay.

<p class="p4"><b>Section not applicable where delay due to carrier's failure to replace strikers.</b> - Granting that the defendant railroad company could relieve itself from liability by showing that every possible effort was promptly made to secure other employees in lieu of those who had violated their obligations to their employer by striking, the proof offered fell far short of due diligence in this respect. If the company's engineers wrongfully refused to do their duty, certainly it was incumbent upon the railroad officials to discharge them and use every endeavor to secure new men who were competent and willing to perform the services they ought to have rendered. It did not appear that the officers of the company made any attempt whatever to do this; and however great their embarrassment may have been, if they voluntarily elected, for any cause, to retain in the service of the company employees who openly and willfully refused to properly attend to the duties devolving upon them, the company must be held answerable for any loss to its patrons which they may have suffered in consequence.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>General rule stated.</b> - The general rule is that the measure of damages for unreasonable delay by a common carrier in the delivery of goods shipped is the difference between their market value when they should have been delivered and their market value when they were delivered, with interest from the former date, less the freight, if unpaid. Mere unreasonable delay in transporting does not amount to conversion, so as to authorize the consignee, upon the arrival of the goods, to reject them and sue for their full value. The owner's remedy is to sue for the damages the owner has sustained by reason of the delay. Atlanta Coast Line R.R. v. Tifton Produce Co., 179 Ga. 624, 176 S.E. 624 (1934), answer conformed to, 50 Ga. App. 614, 179 S.E. 125 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The correct measure of damage is ordinarily the difference in the market value of the fruit at the point of shipment at the time the cars should have been furnished, and at the time they were actually furnished. Central of Ga. Ry. v. George P. Greene &amp; Co., 41 Ga. App. 794, 154 S.E. 809 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mitigation of damages.</b> - Where at the time of trial shipper had recovered the goods, the measure of its damages would be that for failure of the carrier to deliver the goods within a reasonable time, i.e., the difference between the market value at the time and place they should have been delivered and the market value at the time of actual delivery. The fact that the shipment on which the carrier claimed a lien was eventually returned to the shipper by court order before trial, and that shipper was able to sell it, would be relevant only in mitigation of the damages. Esquire Carpet Mills, Inc. v. Kennesaw Transp., Inc., 186 Ga. App. 367, 367 S.E.2d 569 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damage rule not strictly applicable where goods destroyed.</b> - The rule of damages under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2773 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-43) did not strictly apply to an action for the recovery of the value of potatoes that have been totally destroyed. Louisville &amp; N.R.R. v. Lovelace, 26 Ga. App. 286, 106 S.E. 6 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery for full value where carrier negligently delays delivery.</b> - Where the evidence showed that at the time of the actual delivery the goods had been rendered valueless by the negligent delay of the carrier, under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2319 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-43), a recovery for the full value of the goods when and where they should have been delivered would be upheld. Southern Express Co. v. Briggs, 1 Ga. App. 294, 57 S.E. 1066 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract contrary to section not valid.</b> - A common carrier cannot by special contract relieve itself from the measure of damages under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2773 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-43), where the goods were damaged by reason of its negligence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Point of which common carrier's responsibility as insurer commences.</b> - Responsibility of common carrier as insurer of goods commences where there is complete delivery for the purpose of immediate transportation. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier liable for delivery of goods within reasonable time.</b> Reception of goods to be carried makes carrier liable for their safe custody and transportation within a reasonable time; if the carrier would relieve oneself from liability, the carrier should, by proof, show such facts as may be necessary for that purpose. Southern Express Co. v. Newby, 36 Ga. 635, 91 Am. Dec. 783 (1867). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Liability of the common carrier exists only, in the absence of an express or implied contract to the contrary, when the carrier is in complete possession and control of the goods for immediate shipment with nothing remaining to be done by the shipper to complete the consignment to the shipper for the purpose of carriage, and only until the goods are delivered to their destination and notice given to the consignee. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Status as carrier or warehouseman distinguished.</b> - If a common carrier receives goods into the carrier's own warehouse for the accommodation of oneself and the carrier's customers, so that the deposit there is a mere accessory to the carriage and for the purpose of facilitating it, the carrier's liability as a carrier will commence with the receipt of the goods; but, on the contrary, if the goods when so deposited are not ready for immediate transportation, and the carrier cannot make arrangements for their carriage to the place of destination until something further is done, or some further direction is given or communication made concerning them by the owner, or consignor, the deposit must be considered to be in the meantime for the carrier's convenience and accommodation, and the receiver, until some change takes place, will be responsible only as a warehouseman. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The relation of shipper and carrier does not begin between the owner of goods and a railway company, though the former may have delivered the goods to the latter, if after such delivery anything required, either by law or the contract, remains to be done by the shipper, and in such case the rights and liability of the company are those only of a warehouseman.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Usage or course of dealing may imply duty of safe-keeping.</b> - Contract imposing upon carrier exclusive duty of safekeeping may be implied by usage or a course of dealing between the parties; but the implication that the carrier assumes the duty of immediate transportation and so responsibility as an insurer, without knowing to what place and to whom goods are to be shipped, must be clear. Bell v. Fitz, 78 Ga. App. 28, 50 S.E.2d 241 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Shipping directions essential to complete delivery.</b> - Giving of shipping directions, expressly or impliedly, is essential to complete delivery which causes the liability of the carrier as an insurer to arise.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loading car on sidetrack as delivery.</b> - Where a railroad company, in pursuance of an agreement with a warehouse company, places one of its cars on a sidetrack in front of the warehouse, for the purpose of having the car loaded with cotton stored in the warehouse, for immediate shipment, the railroad company to pay for the work of loading, and the cotton was loaded onto the car by employees of the warehouse company, properly marked as to destination, and with name of consignor and consignee, this was a delivery under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2730 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-45) to the railroad company as a common carrier of the cotton, and the railroad company would be responsible to the owner of the cotton for its destruction by fire while in its possession. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Bird, 10 Ga. App. 423, 73 S.E. 599 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Removing car from sidetrack.</b> - There is nothing in the laws or public policy of this state which prevents a shipper and a railroad company from making a contract in relation to the use of a sidetrack, wherein it is agreed that, as to cars loaded by the shipper on the sidetrack, delivery to the carrier is understood to have taken place whenever the carrier removes the car from the sidetrack and places it in its freight train for shipment. Bainbridge Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 8 Ga. App. 677, 70 S.E. 154 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reception of goods at depot.</b> - If the agent of a carrier agreed to receive goods at the depot where they were at the time, the liability as a common carrier began under former Code 1863, <span class="s1">§</span> 2043 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-45). Southern Express Co. v. Newby, 36 Ga. 635, 91 Am. Dec. 783 (1867).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery to carrier must be proved.</b> - Delivery of the goods must be proved in order to charge a common carrier for their loss. It is a fact for the jury to determine, and if there is any evidence of delivery, the case will go to the jury on that fact. Dibble v. Brown &amp; Harris, 12 Ga. 217, 56 Am. Dec. 460 (1852).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ending responsibility as carrier.</b> - As a general rule a railroad company is responsible as common carrier only for the safe deposit of goods shipped by freight upon the platform or in the warehouse of the road at the end of their transit, there to await delivery to the consignee when the consignee should call for them; and from the time of such deposit, even without notice by the carrier to the consignee, the liability of the railway is usually changed from that of a common carrier to that of a warehouseman. Georgia &amp; A. Ry. v. Pound, 111 Ga. 6, 36 S.E. 312 (1900). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where goods were shipped by railway, and arrive at their destination within the usual time required for transportation, and were there deposited by the company in a place of safety and held by them ready to be delivered on demand, their liability as common carriers ceased under former Code 1868, <span class="s1">§</span> 2044 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-45) (unless the custom of the trade was shown to be otherwise as to delivery), and that of warehouseman began. Southwestern R.R. v. Felder, 46 Ga. 433 (1872); Kight v. Wrightsville &amp; T.R.R., 127 Ga. 204, 56 S.E. 363 (1906); Allen v. Southern Ry., 33 Ga. App. 209, 126 S.E. 722 (1924). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Carrier was not liable for the injuries sustained by the injured party when a valve on a container holding hazardous materials exploded after delivery of the container; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-45, the carrier's responsibility ceased with the delivery of the goods to their destination. Booth v. Quality Carriers, Inc., 276 Ga. App. 406, 623 S.E.2d 244 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Delivery of loaded cars to consignee.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2730 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-45), it was held that the carrier's relation as such ceased on delivery of loaded cars to the consignee, and until it retook possession of the cars after unloading. The railroad was not liable, therefore for a destruction of the cars by fire. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Milledgeville Ry., 138 Ga. 434, 75 S.E. 614 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice to consignee.</b> - The law nowhere imposes upon common carriers the obligation of notifying consignees of the arrival of their freight at the point of destination; provided, it has arrived in the due course of transportation. Southwestern R.R. v. Felder, 46 Ga. 433 (1872); Georgia &amp; A. Ry. v. Pound, 111 Ga. 6, 36 S.E. 312 (1900). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If goods arrive out of time, and after they have been demanded by the consignee, it might require notice of their arrival to the consignee, and a reasonable time after, to relieve the company from the extraordinary liability imposed by law upon a common carrier. Southwestern R.R. v. Felder, 46 Ga. 433 (1872).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery at destination to agent.</b> - A delivery of goods to the duly authorized agent of the owner or assignee is a good delivery. Southern Express Co. v. Everett, 37 Ga. 688 (1868).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Goods remaining in car after verification at destination.</b> - Where a railroad company has transported a carload of goods and notified the consignee of their arrival, the delivery is complete when the agent of the consignee verifies the goods in the car and gives a receipt for the same; and where the agent of the consignee removes most of the goods, but leaves some in the car on account of approaching night, and the car is broken open after having been closed and sealed by the agent of the railroad company, and some of the goods stolen therefrom, the railroad company, if liable at all, is liable only for gross neglect, as a gratuitous bailee. Allen v. Southern Ry., 33 Ga. App. 209, 126 S.E. 722 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery beyond terminus.</b> - Whether a railroad company is bound to carry or transport goods to a point of destination beyond the terminus of its road, depends upon the contract between the parties. Savannah, F. &amp; W. Ry. v. Collins, 77 Ga. 376, 3 S.E. 416, 4 Am. St. R. 87 (1886).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Boat landing as destination.</b> - If the owner of a boat directs cotton to be left at a particular landing on the river, agreeing to receive it there, a deposit of the cotton at that place constitutes a good delivery. Fleming v. Hammond, 19 Ga. 145 (1855).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence of custom not admissible to vary contract.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2730 (see O.C.G.A <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-45), parol evidence of usage and custom to vary the terms of a plain, unambiguous written contract was not admissible.

But a carrier is not permitted to deposit a passenger at a place which it knows will reasonably expose the passenger to unusual and unnecessary peril, and it may be held liable for a proximately resulting injury.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Circumstances dictate degree of extraordinary care required.</b> - What extraordinary care requires depends upon circumstances. One circumstance for consideration in dealing with a passenger is the condition of such passenger, known to the carrier or its agents, or so apparent as to charge them with knowledge. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Madden, 135 Ga. 205, 69 S.E. 165, 31 L.R.A. (n.s.) 813, 21 Ann. Cas. 1077 (1910). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where the standard is the diligence of very thoughtful persons, and where utmost diligence is greater than the standard, the diligence of every prudent and thoughtful person is, if anything, less than the standard, for it includes the degree of diligence of all prudent and thoughtful persons, whether or not they reach the comparative form of very prudent and thoughtful persons or the superlative of the most prudent and thoughtful persons.

<p class="p4"><b>Passenger carrier bound to exercise extraordinary care.</b> - Carrier of passengers is bound to exercise extraordinary care and diligence for the safety of the carrier's passengers, and it matters not the kind of conveyance used or the nature of the motive power employed.

<p class="p4">Under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2067 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-132) there certainly can be no doubt that if a railroad company failed to exercise extraordinary diligence for the safety of its passengers, it would be liable for injuries occasioned because of such failure to a passenger who personally exercised the proper care for the passenger's own protection.

<p class="p4">A carrier of passengers is bound to exercise extraordinary diligence on behalf of the carrier and the carrier's agents to protect the lives and persons of his passengers, and if, after entering into the relation of carrier for hire and passenger, the servant of the carrier be guilty of any negligence resulting in a breach of duty owing to the passenger, the carrier will be liable for nominal damages at least. Tennessee Coach Co. v. Snelling, 51 Ga. App. 432, 180 S.E. 741 (1935). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">If plaintiff was a passenger in defendant's taxicab at the time plaintiff was raped by the driver of the cab, plaintiff would be entitled to recover, for plaintiff was entitled, by virtue of plaintiff's contract of passenger carriage, not only to be protected against the negligent acts of the company's agent resulting from the omission to perform its duties to its passengers, but plaintiff was likewise entitled to be protected against the wanton and willful acts of violence wrongfully committed on plaintiff's person by the servant of the company during the continuance of the relation instituted by plaintiff's contract with the company.

<p class="p4"><b>Liability for assault by servant not dependent upon scope of employment.</b> - Liability of a common carrier for an assault by one of its employees on a passenger is not dependent on the question as to whether the employee was acting within the scope of employment or in the line of the employee's duty, but is based upon its broad duty as a common carrier to protect its passengers from assault. Southeastern Greyhound Corp. v. Graham, 69 Ga. App. 621, 26 S.E.2d 371 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Servant's duty toward passenger becoming ill in transit.</b> - If a passenger on a railway train becomes ill in transit, and this is known to the servants of the carrier in charge of such train, or is so apparent that they are charged with knowledge of it, it is their duty to give the passenger such care and protection beyond that demanded under ordinary circumstances as is reasonably practicable with the facilities at hand, and consistent with the safe and proper conduct of the business and the safety and comfort of the other passengers. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Madden, 135 Ga. 205, 69 S.E. 165, 31 L.R.A. (n.s.) 813, 21 Ann. Cas. 1077 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An express contract attempting waiver void.</b> - An express contract entered into by the carrier and the passenger, under the terms of which the carrier is released from all liability to the passenger for personal injuries received while a passenger on such freight-train, is in effect a contract by which the carrier undertakes to relieve itself from the consequences of the negligence of itself and servants, and cannot be enforced. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Lippman, 110 Ga. 665, 36 S.E. 202, 50 L.R.A. 673 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presumption of negligence.</b> - Upon proof of injury to a passenger of a railroad company by the running of its locomotive, cars, or other machinery, or by any person in its employment and service, the law raises a presumption that the injury was caused by the negligence of the company. Douthitt v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., 136 Ga. 351, 71 S.E. 470 (1911). See also Central R.R. v. Freeman, 75 Ga. 331 (1885). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a passenger is injured, a legal presumption that the carrier failed to exercise extraordinary care arises in the passenger's favor. The carrier can, of course, rebut this presumption by making it appear that extraordinary care and diligence was exercised. This is a jury question. Eason v. Crews, 88 Ga. App. 602, 77 S.E.2d 245 (1953); Piller v. Hanger Cab. Co., 115 Ga. App. 260, 154 S.E.2d 420 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rebuttal of presumption.</b> - In an action by a passenger against a street-railway company on account of a personal injury, after a presumption of negligence arises from the evidence, in order to rebut it the defendant must make it appear from the evidence that its agents or servants exercised extraordinary care and diligence in connection with those things in which it was charged that its negligence consisted. Brunswick &amp; A.R.R. v. Gale, 56 Ga. 322 (1876); Georgia Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. Gilleland, 133 Ga. 621, 66 S.E. 944 (1909). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where an injury to a passenger is proved to have been caused by a company's negligence, the presumption against the company will not be rebutted by the company showing that it exercised only ordinary care and diligence; as railroad companies are bound to use extraordinary care and diligence for the safety of passengers by reason of former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2067 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-132).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Helping passenger alight.</b> - As a general rule, it is not the duty of the employees of a railway company in charge of a passenger train to physically assist passengers in alighting therefrom, but to furnish reasonable opportunity and facilities for leaving the train; but the duty of rendering assistance may arise from special circumstances. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Madden, 135 Ga. 205, 69 S.E. 165, 31 L.R.A. (n.s.) 813, 21 Ann. Cas. 1077 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier's duty toward passenger continues until passenger safely deposited.</b> - Where relation of carrier and passenger is once established, it continues until passenger is safely deposited at passenger's point of destination, and until the passenger has left or has had a reasonable time within which to leave the cab of the carrier; and if, during the continuance of this relation, the passenger suffers an injury in consequence of the negligent, wrongful or wanton tort of the carrier's driver, the carrier is liable. Co-op Cab Co. v. Singleton, 66 Ga. App. 874, 19 S.E.2d 541 (1942); Southeastern Greyhound Corp. v. Graham, 69 Ga. App. 621, 26 S.E.2d 371 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The relationship of carrier and passenger exists until the passenger's destination has been reached and the passenger has either alighted from the means of conveyance in safety or has been afforded reasonable time and opportunity to do so. Delta Air Lines v. Millirons, 87 Ga. App. 334, 73 S.E.2d 598 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The relationship of carrier and passenger terminates when the passenger has been safely discharged and when the carrier is no longer bound to exercise extraordinary care for the passenger's safety, but is bound to use only the same degree of care for the passenger's safety as it would for the safety of any other member of the public upon its premises by invitation, express or implied. Delta Air Lines v. Millirons, 87 Ga. App. 334, 73 S.E.2d 598 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Carrier's duty to exercise extraordinary care for the safety of its passengers continues until the passenger has been conducted to a place where the passenger has some freedom of locomotion and can in a measure look out for the passenger's own safety. Delta Air Lines v. Millirons, 87 Ga. App. 334, 73 S.E.2d 598 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a passenger is discharged at an unsafe place and is injured, it is immaterial that the passenger has alighted. The duty of the carrier continues until the passenger is out of such danger. Columbus Transp. Co. v. Curry, 104 Ga. App. 700, 122 S.E.2d 584 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Duties of train operators when entering or leaving stations.</b> - Plaintiff, in a suit seeking damages for injuries which occurred when plaintiff was struck by a train at a station, failed to come forward with any evidence rebutting the affidavits of the train's operators showing that they did nothing to breach their duty of care, i.e., each operator averred that the operator had been trained "to be extremely alert and to maintain a constant visual check of conditions as far ahead as possible" when entering and leaving the station and "to visually scan the entire station area, including the platforms and the track itself," and that the operator had done so upon entering and leaving the station on the morning in question and had observed nothing unusual. Robertson v. Metropolitan Atl. Rapid Transit Auth., 199 Ga. App. 681, 405 S.E.2d 745 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier's duty to discharge passenger at safe place.</b> - The duty of the operator of a public carrier to exercise extraordinary care and diligence in selecting a safe place to discharge passengers is met when the operator does in fact discharge them at a reasonably safe place. Columbus Transp. Co. v. Curry, 104 Ga. App. 700, 122 S.E.2d 584 (1961). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ordinarily a common carrier of passengers by street car or other conveyance on city streets discharges its legal duty to a passenger when it deposits the passenger at a usual and reasonably safe place for alighting and crossing the street.

<p class="p4"><b>Carrier liable for depositing passenger at unsafe location.</b> - Carrier is not permitted to deposit passenger at place which it knows will reasonably expose the passenger to unusual peril, and it may be held liable for a proximately resulting injury. Locke v. Ford, 54 Ga. App. 322, 187 S.E. 715 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Carrier not liable to passenger for usual dangers of traffic.</b> - A carrier is not under a duty to wait until approaching automobiles have stopped or to warn a passenger of the usual dangers of traffic which in the passenger's exercise of ordinary care would be avoidable. Locke v. Ford, 54 Ga. App. 322, 187 S.E. 715 (1936); Greeson v. Davis, 62 Ga. App. 667, 9 S.E.2d 690 (1940); Jordan v. Wiggins, 66 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rule of liability for failure to discharge at safe place.</b> - The rule of liability against a carrier for negligence in discharging a passenger at an unsafe place is not that the carrier must show knowledge on the part of its operator that an unsafe condition exists, but only slight negligence in depositing the passenger at a place which will reasonably expose the passenger to peril. Columbus Transp. Co. v. Curry, 104 Ga. App. 700, 122 S.E.2d 584 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty of care when discharging child passenger.</b> - In the case of a child of tender years diligence required of school bus driver to deposit passenger at a reasonably safe place must be exercised with a consideration of the limited abilities of the minor, and whether, with respect to the minor, a safe place has been selected is usually a question for the jury. Greeson v. Davis, 62 Ga. App. 667, 9 S.E.2d 690 (1940); Jordan v. Wiggins, 66 Ga. App. 534, 18 S.E.2d 512 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jury Issues and Instructions</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury instructions.</b> - Failure to instruct the jury that a cab driver could assume that the driver of the other car would obey the law of right of way was not error, as extraordinary diligence might, in the opinion of the jury, require that the driver should look out for law violators as one of the perils which might interfere with the driver's safe transit, and it was a question for the jury to determine what extraordinary diligence demanded. Black &amp; White Cab Co. v. Clark, 67 Ga. App. 170, 19 S.E.2d 570 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action against a carrier for wrongful death of a passenger due to negligent operation of a bus, the judge should instruct the jury that the duty of the driver to exercise extraordinary care continued in all events, whether or not the jury believed that the driver was confronted with a sudden emergency, but that if they should conclude that a sudden emergency did arise, in deciding whether the driver continued to exercise extraordinary care they should take into consideration the fact that when one is confronted with a sudden emergency the driver is not to be held to the same accuracy of judgment as would be required of the driver if the driver had time for deliberation. Scott v. Torrance, 69 Ga. App. 309, 25 S.E.2d 120 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Failure to define the term "extraordinary diligence" in an instruction on the law pertaining to the duty a carrier owes to its passengers was not harmful error because the term is comprised of words of ordinary understanding and is self-explanatory. Adams v. MARTA, 246 Ga. App. 698, 542 S.E.2d 130 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining facts sufficient for extraordinary diligence is jury question.</b> - What facts suffice to show exercise of extraordinary diligence is ordinarily question for jury. Modern Coach Corp. v. Faver, 87 Ga. App. 221, 73 S.E.2d 497 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">It was ordinarily for the jury to determine whether the performance or nonperformance of a specific act was in compliance with the duty imposed on a carrier by the provisions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 18-204 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-132) as to the exercise by it of extraordinary care and diligence.

<p class="p4">It is for the jury to say, under all the facts, whether the company was negligent in not providing a suitable conductor to preserve order, or whether the person in charge of the car as driver was negligent in the preservation of order thereof, and the safe carriage of the passengers to the place of destination. Holly v. Atlanta S.R.R., 61 Ga. 215, 34 Am. R. 97 (1878). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Where decedent was run over by a bus after the driver let decedent off on the roadway approximately four feet from the curb and about 25 feet from the bus stop, the issues of decedent's negligence and the duty of care owed to decedent were questions for the jury. Cuthbert v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 190 Ga. App. 550, 379 S.E.2d 413, cert. denied, 190 Ga. App. 897, 379 S.E.2d 443 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff's lack of due care also jury question.</b> - Whether there was a lack of due care on the part of the plaintiff who was injured when alighting from a bus which had stopped 35 feet from the regular stopping point was a question of fact for the jury.

<p class="p4"><b>Duty to exercise ordinary care in providing station facilities distinguished.</b> - The carrier's duty of exercising ordinary care to furnish safe station facilities for those to be received or for those who have been discharged as passengers is not to be confused with the carrier's duty to use extraordinary care in receiving, transporting and discharging its passengers. Delta Air Lines v. Millirons, 87 Ga. App. 334, 73 S.E.2d 598 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Passenger who has not entered cars.</b> - One who has a railroad ticket and is present to take the train at the ordinary point of departure, is a passenger, though the passenger has not entered the cars. In duties toward the passenger, directly involving the passenger's safety, the company is bound to extraordinary diligence, and in those touching the passenger's convenience or accommodation, to ordinary diligence.

Walker v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 226 Ga. App. 793, 487 S.E.2d 498 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Injury through fault of passenger.</b> - No person shall recover from a railroad company for an injury to oneself or the passenger's property, where the same is done by the passenger's consent, or is caused by the passenger's own negligence. If the plaintiff and the agents of the company are both at fault, the former may recover, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of default attributable to plaintiff. Central R.R. v. Brinson, 70 Ga. 207 (1883).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Passenger not relieved of duty to exercise ordinary care for own safety.</b> - The duty to exercise extraordinary care which was imposed upon common carriers as defendants did not abrogate the requirement which a tort plaintiff had under <span class="s1">§</span> 51-11-7 to exercise ordinary care for one's own safety to avoid the consequences caused by the defendant's negligence. Knight v. Atlanta Transit Sys., 137 Ga. App. 667, 224 S.E.2d 790 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice of possible criminal activity.</b> - Passenger's comments to bus company's ticket agent that police would probably be looking for the passenger and that the agent should not tell them where the passenger was were insufficient to put company on notice that the passenger would be a danger to other passengers. Southeastern Stages, Inc. v. Stringer, 263 Ga. 641, 437 S.E.2d 315 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When the event causing harm to a passenger is a criminal act by a third party, the duty of the carrier to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent that act arises only if the carrier has reason to anticipate it.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Injury or humiliation caused by third persons.</b> - A railroad company is bound to use extraordinary care and diligence to protect its passengers, while in transit, from violence, injury, or outrage and humiliation by third persons. This protection must be afforded by the conductor to the extent of all the power with which the conductor is clothed by the company or by the law, and the conductor's failure to afford it, when the conductor had knowledge that there was occasion for the conductor's interference, will subject the company to liability in damages. Hillman v. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking, 126 Ga. 814, 56 S.E. 68, 8 Ann. Cas. 222 (1906). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Legal principles applied equally to air and rail carriers.</b> - The governing principles of law concerning the termination of the relation of carrier and passenger have been laid down in cases involving carriers by rail, and these principles are also controlling in an action against a carrier by air, since both types of carrier operate upon fixed schedules and over fixed routes, and ordinarily discharge their passengers at a station or terminal facility located at the passenger's destination. Delta Air Lines v. Millirons, 87 Ga. App. 334, 73 S.E.2d 598 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Georgia R.R. v. Homer, 73 Ga. 251 (1884).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Elevator as carrier.</b> - The owner of an office building, equipped with an elevator which is operated for conveying the owner's tenants and their employees and patrons to and from the various floors, was not a common carrier in the sense that the owner was bound to serve all the public; yet the owner's duty as to protecting passengers in the elevator was the same under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2714 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-132) as that chargeable to carriers of passengers by other means. Grant v. Allen, 141 Ga. 106, 80 S.E. 279 (1913). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Owner of elevator in an office building owes duty of extraordinary diligence to elevator passengers and cannot delegate this duty to an independent contractor engaged in elevator repair; thus, the owner is liable for slight negligence.

<p class="p4">One who carries passengers on an elevator from floor to floor of a large office building, or of a hotel, constantly and continuously, is a carrier of passengers. No rational distinction in principle can be based on the fact that the passengers are carried vertically rather than horizontally; and the distance the passengers are carried is not material. Helmly v. Savannah Office Bldg. Co., 13 Ga. App. 498, 79 S.E. 364 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Escalator owner's and servicer's duty.</b> - The duty of extraordinary care was imposed on owner of the building because the escalator was operated and the servicer was employed by the owner. Millar Elevator Serv. Co. v. O'Shields, 222 Ga. App. 456, 475 S.E.2d 188 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Employee riding on free pass treated as passenger for hire.</b> - Where one employed generally by a railroad is issued trip passes on trains to go to and from work, and is also permitted to ride without the payment of fare without using one's pass, and is not engaged in or within the scope of one's employment while so riding on a train, the employee occupies the status of a passenger for hire, and the railroad is liable to the employee for injuries inflicted by its negligence, while the employee is so riding, and if the injury occurs at a time when the employee is using a pass a limitation therein relieving the railroad from liability on account of its negligence is void. Fowler v. Western &amp; A.R.R., 75 Ga. App. 156, 42 S.E.2d 499 (1947).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Receiving passenger on freight trains.</b> - A carrier who receives a passenger on one of its freight trains is bound by the same standard of diligence as if the passenger were being transported on a regular passenger-train. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Lippman, 110 Ga. 665, 36 S.E. 202, 50 L.R.A. 673 (1900). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A passenger who voluntarily seeks to be transported on a freight-train takes the risk of the usual and necessary jolts and jars which occur in the operation of such train, but the carrier is not relieved from the use of extraordinary diligence to the passenger to prevent unusual and unnecessary jolts and jars.

<p class="p4"><b>"Baggage" defined.</b> - By baggage is understood such articles of necessity or personal convenience, as are usually carried by passengers, for their personal use. What articles are usually carried by passengers, is a question to be left to the jury. Dibble v. Brown &amp; Harris, 12 Ga. 217, 56 Am. Dec. 460 (1852). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">By baggage is meant the ordinary wearing apparel customarily carried by travelers, and such other articles as may be needed for the passenger's comfort or amusement.

<p class="p4"><b>Extra baggage.</b> - If railroads receive extra baggage, to be carried for compensation, they are, as to such extra baggage, liable as common carriers. Dibble v. Brown &amp; Harris, 12 Ga. 217, 56 Am. Dec. 460 (1852).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Money and merchandise not "baggage".</b> - Money, except for the payment of expenses, and merchandise are not included in the term baggage. Dibble v.

<p class="p4"><b>Carrier of baggage liable as common carrier.</b> - Those who carry passengers for hire, as regards the passengers' baggage, are like common carriers, liable for its loss, unless caused by the act of God or the public enemy.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Detention of baggage.</b> - During the time within which a railroad company may reasonably detain a passenger's baggage, the relation of carrier and passenger still exists between the parties, and the liability of the railroad company does not become that of a mere warehouseman. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking v. Phillips, 93 Ga. 801, 20 S.E. 646 (1894). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Carrier's liability not applicable where passenger leaves trunks in baggage room.</b> - One who, having been a passenger, arrives with one's baggage at destination, surrenders one's checks, opens up the trunks in the baggage room, and afterwards leaves the trunks in the baggage room by permission of the baggage clerk, upon a statement that one will be going off again next day and will then recheck them, cannot hold the railway company responsible, as a carrier of baggage, for the destruction of the trunks by fire during the night.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Origin of section.</b> - Former Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2287 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-191) did not have its origin in a statute of this state. It appears for the first time in the Code of 1863. It has, however, all the binding effect of an original act of the legislature, because of the adoption by the legislature of the codes wherein it appears. Central of Ga. Ry. v. State, 104 Ga. 831, 31 S.E. 531, 42 L.R.A. 518 (1898); Wilensky v. Central of Ga. Ry., 136 Ga. 889, 72 S.E. 418, 1912D Ann. Cas. 271 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compliance with contract as condition precedent.</b> - The first sentence of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-191 clearly requires compliance with the contract for transportation of the goods as a condition precedent to acquiring a lien for unpaid freight charges, and thus carrier could not acquire a lien on goods which it refused to deliver. Esquire Carpet Mills, Inc. v. Kennesaw Transp., Inc., 186 Ga. App. 367, 367 S.E.2d 569 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No lien where goods are lost.</b> - No lien under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2287 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-191) for freight could arise in favor of a carrier against the consignee for charges upon the goods which were lost. Robinson v. Dover &amp; S.R.R., 99 Ga. 480, 27 S.E. 713 (1896).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right of carrier to prevent reshipment.</b> - Where a carrier has a lien under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2077 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-191) on the property for freight charges, the consignor was under an obligation to settle with the company for the freight and storage charges before exercising the right to receive the shipment or to direct a reshipment of the property. Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking, 94 Ga. 636, 21 S.E. 577 (1894); Southern Ry. v. Born Steel Range Co., 126 Ga. 527, 55 S.E. 173 (1906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lien by last carrier where mistake by initial carrier.</b> - Where there was a mistake by the first carrier in directing the goods, under former Code 1882, <span class="s1">§</span> 2077 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-191), the last carrier will have a lien upon them for the freight earned by it, unless the owner gave notice of the route and the lines of road over which the owner's goods were to be transported. Bird v. Georgia R.R., 72 Ga. 655 (1884).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lien as defense to contract action.</b> - A shipper cannot maintain against a carrier an action ex contractu for the value of goods consigned to the carrier for shipment and not delivered, when the carrier tendered the goods at destination in a damaged condition but refused to deliver them unless the shipper pays the usual freight charges in accordance with former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2741 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-191), notwithstanding the damages to the goods amount to more than the freight charges, and the shipper demanded that the damages to the shipment be offset against the freight bill. Wilensky v. Central of Ga. Ry., 136 Ga. 889, 72 S.E. 418, 1912D Ann. Cas. 271 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lien as a defense to trover.</b> - Under former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§</span> 2287 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-9-191) it had been held that the consignee of goods transported by a railway company cannot, ordinarily, recover them in an action of trover against the carrier, unless the consignee has first paid or tendered the freight and storage charges which had accrued, according to the rates and rules of the railroad commission. Seaboard Air-Line Ry. v. Shackelford, 5 Ga. App. 395, 63 S.E. 252 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Waiver or modification.</b> - Carrier's right to a lien for payment of the freight charges was clearly waived, or at least modified, by the special contract between the parties which provided that no payment was due until 15 days after loading, despite the fact that goods had been delivered prior to that time. Thus, unless the payment was due under the contract, no lien attached. Esquire Carpet Mills, Inc. v. Kennesaw Transp., Inc., 186 Ga.
