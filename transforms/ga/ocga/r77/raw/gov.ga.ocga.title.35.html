<p class="p4"><b>Investigation of missing persons.</b> - State proved that the false statement alleged in the indictment was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) because the GBI was actively investigating a missing person case; because two videos contained clues referencing a Georgia missing person and the location of a missing person's body parts in Augusta, and it was then determined that the computer from which the videos were being posted was in Georgia, the jury could reasonably infer that the other missing person cases referenced in the first video would have a Georgia connection, giving the GBI jurisdiction to investigate the cases.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>State free to maintain more or less restrictive access policy than contained in federal guidelines.</b> - Recent changes in the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration regulations indicate that these rules are to be viewed as broad guidelines which set the outermost limits on the collection, storage, and dissemination of criminal history data; under this concept, the states would be free to maintain a more restrictive policy regarding public access to criminal history records, unless through legislation, ordinance, or executive or court order a state elects to adopt a more liberal policy in regard to the public's right to gain access to criminal history information. 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-57.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>General Assembly expressed desire to narrowly open access to criminal records to the private sector</b> for the limited purpose of making preemployment checks and job assignment decisions in certain circumstances, as well as to have such information to assist them in making a determination as to whether to prosecute persons apprehended on the premises who are engaged in a criminal act against the business. 1976 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Employment agencies, credit corporations, and firms doing background checks not entitled to information.</b> - Subparagraph (a)(1)(A) refers to those individuals directly involved in making the ultimate decision as to whether to hire or transfer an individual to a new job assignment; accordingly, employment agencies, retail credit corporations, and firms doing background checks would not be entitled to criminal history information under this section. 1976 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Private security agency member not entitled to information.</b> - Private security agency member hired by a business to protect the business's property, or any other member of the security agency hired by a business, would not be entitled to the criminal history information on the individual the agency has apprehended, or the agency suspects of committing a crime, since the security agency is not the business against whom the crime or suspected crime has been committed. 1976 Op.

<p class="p4"><b>Permissible to relax local querying requirement when adjudications of guilt on criminal suspects sought.</b> - Furnishing of adjudications of guilt to the personnel of a business on persons apprehended or suspected of having committed a specific criminal act, in which the victim is the business, is more in the nature of a criminal justice dissemination for which time in furnishing such information may be of the essence, so as not to prolong any detention of the individual apprehended; accordingly, it would be permissible to relax the local querying requirement when adjudications of guilt are sought. 1976 Op.

Such court shall maintain jurisdiction over the case for this limited purpose and duration. Such petition shall be served on the arresting law enforcement agency and the prosecuting attorney. If a hearing is requested, such hearing shall be held within 90 days of the filing of the petition. The court shall hear evidence and shall grant an order restricting such criminal history record information if the court determines that the misdemeanor conviction was not a lesser included offense of the felony charge and that the harm otherwise resulting to the individual clearly outweighs the public interest in the criminal history record information being publicly available. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Such court shall maintain jurisdiction over the case for this limited purpose and duration. Such petition shall be served on the prosecuting attorney.

If a hearing is requested, such hearing shall be held within 90 days of the filing of the petition.

<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code Section 35-3-37, which was subsequently repealed but was succeeded by provisions in this Code section, are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of amendments.</b> - Recent amendments to Georgia's criminal history record information statute, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37, are to be applied to information regarding arrests occurring prior to the amendments' effective date as the statute itself made clear that the statute does apply to information regarding arrests pre-dating the amendments, and such application presents no constitutional problem. Mosley v. Lowe, 298 Ga. 363, 782 S.E.2d 43 (2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">County erred and should have granted the defendant's request to have the defendant's arrest record restricted pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37(h) because it was undisputed that the 1996 assault charge against the defendant was nolle prossed and, as such, that disposition did not fall within any of the exceptions enumerated in paragraph (i)(1) of the statute and the defendant was eligible for record restriction under the current statute. Mosley v. Lowe, 298 Ga. 363, 782 S.E.2d 43 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Georgia Bureau of Investigation required to restrict record.</b> - To the extent the trial court denied the defendant's motion as to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the order denying expungement was affirmed because the Georgia Crime Information Center was required to restrict the defendant's record and even if the record was not subject to automatic restriction, nothing in the statute permitted the state court to order the Georgia Crime Information Center/Georgia Bureau of Investigation to restrict a record that was not subject to an automatic restriction. Ledbetter v. State, 349 Ga. App. 154, 825 S.E.2d 530 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Investigatory case file open unless privacy invaded.</b> - When "criminal history record information" has been incorporated by a law-enforcement agency into an investigatory case file, it should be open for public inspection unless its disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy. Napper v. Georgia Television Co., 257 Ga. 156, 356 S.E.2d 640 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sealing clerk's records.</b> - Because the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37(m)(2) applied to arrests that pre-dated July 1, 2013, the trial court should have considered the merits of the defendant's motion to seal the clerk's records, and the order denying the defendant's motion to seal the clerk of court's records was vacated.

<p class="p4"><b>Sheriff's office's refusal to expunge subject to appeal to superior court.</b> - Trial court erred in dismissing an indictee's appeal from the sheriff's office's refusal to expunge the indictee's record without determining whether the charges had been nolle prossed for a reason set forth in former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37(d)(7)(A) through (G).

<p class="p4">Because imposition of a sentence upon a plea of nolo contendere was not a dismissal or a nolle prosse, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37(h)(2)(A), providing for restriction of access to certain criminal history records, did not apply to an applicant's plea of nolo contendre to theft by taking; and the applicant's civil rights claim was barred by the statute of limitations, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-33.

<p class="p4"><b>Discretionary appeal procedures.</b> - Appeal of a superior court decision reviewing a decision of an agency denying a request to expunge criminal records requires the discretionary appeal procedures of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-35. Strohecker v. Gwinnett County Police Dep't, 182 Ga. App. 853, 357 S.E.2d 305 (1987) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Appeal to superior court.</b> - By the former statute's express provisions, an appeal from the denial of a request to expunge a criminal record under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37(d)(6) was as provided in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-13-19. In such case, the review should be conducted by the court without a jury and should be confined to the record. Grimes v. Catoosa County Sheriff's Office, 307 Ga. App. 481, 705 S.E.2d 670 (2010) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appellate jurisdiction was in Court of Appeals absent viable constitutional challenge.</b> - Because an appeal of the denial of a motion to seal a criminal record under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37(m) failed to present a viable challenge to the statute's constitutionality, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. VI, Para. II(1), because the challenge (a separation of powers argument, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Para. III, based on the Supreme Court's record-keeping authority under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. IX, Para. I, and Ga. Unif. Super. Ct. R. 21.4) was not raised below, jurisdiction was properly before the Court of Appeals, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 5-6-34(a)(12). Doe v. State, 303 Ga. 237, 811 S.E.2d 413 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading records.</b> - If a criminal record is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, a superior court has three available remedies - expungement, modification, or supplementation - so long as the court finds the remedy to be "required by law" and "appropriate." Meinken v. Burgess, 262 Ga. 863, 426 S.E.2d 876 (1993) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Expungement remedy exceptional.</b> - Expungement should be reserved for exceptional cases based upon competing state and citizen interests, and the fact that the defendant's arrest record did not reflect that the defendant was acquitted by operation of law did not constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting the remedy of expungement instead of modification or supplement. Meinken v. Burgess, 262 Ga. 863, 426 S.E.2d 876 (1993) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-37).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 24-4-60 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-3-160) did not authorize unreasonable searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment because the bodily intrusion of taking a blood or saliva sample was minimal, the state had a compelling interest in obtaining reliable and accurate identifying characteristics of individuals convicted of felonies, and those valid law enforcement interests outweighed a convicted felon's privacy interests; to the extent that probable cause or individualized suspicion was required to justify a search, the prisoners' felony convictions provided that justification. Padgett v. Ferrero, 294 F. Supp. 2d 1338 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (decided under Ga. L. 2000, p. 1071, <span class="s1">§</span> 1). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Padgett v. Ferrero, 294 F. Supp. 2d 1338 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (decided under Ga. L. 2000, p. 1071, <span class="s1">§</span> 1). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Classification of subjecting convicted felons but not convicted misdemeanants to the DNA identification process was rationally related to the Georgia legislature's legitimate law enforcement purpose of creating a permanent identification record of convicted felons because the statute encompassed all convicted felons whose crimes and/or past histories were serious enough to warrant a sentence to confinement, as opposed to lesser punishment, and the legislature acted reasonably and not arbitrarily when the legislature focused on those convicted felons who were housed in a correctional facility where DNA samples can be efficiently and economically obtained.

Further, the purpose of establishing a DNA databank has been identified, and the methods for obtaining data provided by the statute were not excessive measures in response to the purpose, therefore, without any showing of the use of excessive force that might arguably state a claim of cruel and unusual punishment in obtaining DNA samples through involuntary means, the statute was deemed not penal and the means used to enforce the statute had not been shown to be malicious or grossly disproportionate to the refusal to comply with the statutory mandate.

The defendant's argument that the defendant was a probationer at the time of the search was meritless. Leftwich v. State, 299 Ga. App. 392, 682 S.E.2d 614 (2009), cert. denied, No. S09C2013, 2009 Ga.

<p class="p8"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power to direct owner from burning building.</b> - Under the police power, a deputy sheriff is authorized to go upon private property and direct the owner to move back from a burning building, when the deputy has been made aware of the possibility of an explosion, and in the deputy's opinion the safety of a 21/2-year-old child was unnecessarily endangered because of the proximity to the burning structure. Veit v. State, 182 Ga. App. 753, 357 S.E.2d 113 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction with other law.</b> - Juvenile's interference with a juvenile probation officer's attempt to take the juvenile into custody, after the juvenile tested positive for illegal drug use, was sufficient to support an adjudication under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 16-10-24(b); moreover, the appeals court was not persuaded by the juvenile's contention that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 42-8-30 specifically limited the role of the "probation supervisor" over juveniles to those counties in which no juvenile probation system existed. In the Interest of M.M., 287 Ga. App. 233, 651 S.E.2d 155 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 95 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</b> - Trial court erred by entering a default judgment against a police officer for failing to timely answer because the officer was immune from suit on the claim brought under state law; thus, the default judgment entered on that claim was a nullity and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and should have dismissed the state law cause of action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Ferrell v. Young, 323 Ga. App. 338, 746 S.E.2d 167 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Discretionary authority.</b> - With respect to law enforcement officers claiming qualified immunity in a case alleging that certain searches violated Fourth Amendment rights, the officers could show that the officers were acting within the officers' discretionary authority because it is clear that performing searches and assisting in arrests are legitimate job-related functions within the power of law enforcement bodies under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 35-8-2(8)(A). Mehta v. Foskey, 877 F. Supp. 2d 1367 (S.D. Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Immunity when probation officer assisting local law enforcement in pursuit.</b> - In a suit by a passenger against a Department of Corrections (DOC) probation officer whose vehicle collided with the passenger's vehicle during a police chase, because the officer's actions were consistent with DOC's non-defective policy, which allowed the officer to assist law enforcement, DOC had sovereign immunity under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 50-21-24(6).

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power to arrest is essential to status of peace officer.</b> - Employee of agency who is required by oath of office to preserve public order and protect life and property, but does not have power to make arrests, is not a peace officer under this definition. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-31.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Power to arrest confers duty to preserve public order.</b> - There are two conditions provided for in the definition of a peace officer, but it must be understood that once a person is given the power to arrest it necessarily follows that the person has a duty to preserve the public order. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-31.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Park security officers not "peace officers".</b> - Though the security officers of the North Georgia Mountains Authority do have the power of arrest, the security officers fail to meet the definition of "peace officer" on two other grounds: (1) the security officers are not responsible for the enforcement of the criminal laws of the state or its political subdivisions; and (2) the security guards are not employed by the Department of Public Safety, a municipality, or a county. 1972 Op.

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Council authorized to take prior training into account when deciding on individual's certification.</b> - Since the council is authorized to determine who, in the council's judgment and discretion, has fulfilled the training requirements of this chapter and ought to be certified, the council is fully consonant with the council's responsibility and authority to take prior law enforcement training into account when deciding whether or not to certify an individual as a peace officer, regardless of the individual's status at the time the individual received such training. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-118.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Council exceeds powers if council reimburses private personnel.</b> - While it would be fully consistent with the council's statutorily delegated authority to assume the responsibility for reimbursing state and local government units over whose law enforcement personnel the council has mandatory training and certification authority, the council would be exceeding the council's statutory powers if the council were to administrate reimbursement procedures or authorize reimbursement for civilians or other private personnel whom the council is not mandated to train or certify. 1975 Op.

<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The council shall have authority to refuse to grant a certificate to an applicant or to discipline a council certified officer or exempt officer under this chapter or any antecedent law upon a determination by the council that the applicant, council certified officer, or exempt officer has: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Failed to demonstrate the qualifications or standards for a certificate provided in this chapter or in the rules and regulations of the council. It shall be incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the council that he or she meets all requirements for the issuance of a certificate; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Knowingly made misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of being an officer or in any document connected therewith or practiced fraud or deceit or intentionally made any false statement in obtaining a certificate to practice as an officer; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

As used in this paragraph, the term "conviction" shall include a finding or a verdict of guilt, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere in a criminal proceeding, regardless of whether the adjudication of guilt or sentence is withheld or not entered thereon. However, the council may not deny a certificate to an applicant with a conviction if the adjudication of guilt or sentence is withheld or not entered thereon; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Committed a crime involving moral turpitude, without regard to conviction. The conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude shall be conclusive of the commission of such crime.

<p class="p10">(5) Had his or her certificate or license to practice as an officer revoked, suspended, or annulled by any lawful certifying or licensing authority; had other disciplinary action taken against him or her by any lawful certifying or licensing authority; or was denied a certificate or license by any lawful certifying or licensing authority; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Engaged in any unprofessional, unethical, deceptive, or deleterious conduct or practice harmful to the public; such conduct or practice need not have resulted in actual injury to any person.

<p class="p10">(7) Violated or attempted to violate a law, rule, or regulation of this state, any other state, the council, the United States, or any other lawful authority without regard to whether the violation is criminally punishable, so long as such law, rule, or regulation relates to or in part regulates the practice of an officer; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(E) Revoke any certificate; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(F) Condition the penalty, or withhold formal disposition, upon the officer's completing such care, counseling, or treatment, as directed by the council. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) In addition to and in conjunction with the foregoing actions, the council may make a finding adverse to the applicant or officer but withhold imposition of judgment and penalty or it may impose the judgment and penalty but suspend enforcement thereof and place the officer on probation, which may be vacated upon noncompliance with such reasonable terms as the council may impose. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The order of emergency suspension shall be made in writing and shall specify the basis for the executive director's determination. Following the issuance of an emergency suspension order, proceedings of the council in the exercise of its authority to discipline any officer shall be promptly scheduled as provided for in Code Section 35-8-7.2. The emergency suspension order of the executive director shall continue in effect until issuance of the final decision of the council or such order is withdrawn by the executive director. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Notice of the initiation of an investigation shall be sent by priority mail. If the investigation is completed without any further action, notice of the termination of such investigation shall also be provided to the head of the employing agency. In the case of disciplinary action, the notice shall identify the officer and state the nature of the disciplinary action taken. The notice of disposition shall be sent only after the action of the council is deemed final. Such notice shall be sent by priority mail. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It shall be sufficient for this notice to identify the officer and state the length of time, if known, that the officer will not have powers of arrest. Such notice shall be sent by priority mail. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Such term shall not include information prohibited from disclosure by federal law or any document not in the possession of the employer at the time a request for such information is received. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Where an investigation is conducted for the purpose of hiring, certifying, or continuing the certification of a peace officer, an employer shall disclose employment related information to the investigating law enforcement agency upon receiving a written request from such agency.

No employer shall be required to prepare or create any document not already in the employer's possession at the time a request for employment related information is received. Any employment related information provided pursuant to this subsection that is not subject to public disclosure while in the possession of a prior employer shall continue to be privileged and protected from public disclosure as a record of the requesting law enforcement agency. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) No employer or law enforcement agency shall be subject to any civil liability for any cause of action by virtue of disclosing complete and accurate information to a law enforcement agency in good faith and without malice pursuant to this subsection.

Upon the applicant's, candidate's, or peace officer's request, the law enforcement agency shall allow him or her to inspect the employment related information and to submit a written response to such information. The request for inspection shall be made within five business days from the date that the applicant, candidate, or peace officer is notified of the law enforcement agency's receipt of such employment related information. The inspection shall occur not later than ten business days after said notification. Any response to the employment related information shall be made by the applicant, candidate, or peace officer not later than three business days after his or her inspection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It shall not be a violation of this Code section for a person to fail to provide requested information based on a claim that such information is self-incriminating provided that notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested information. An action against such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the claim of self-incrimination is not substantiated may be brought in the superior court of the county of such party's residence or where such information is located.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
