<p class="p4">Trial court erred in concluding that the alleged oral agreement for attorney fees was unenforceable and, therefore, granting the defendant summary judgment because some evidence existed that the plaintiff relied on the defendant's promise and continued negotiating the land deal, all the while incurring legal expenses and losing the value of obtaining the return of the escrowed funds and the opportunity to seek another buyer.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred in concluding that the alleged oral agreement for attorney's fees was unenforceable and, therefore, granting the defendant summary judgment because the evidence, including an e-mail, showed that the defendant promised to pay the attorney fees and other expenses that the plaintiff would ultimately incur in responding to the declaratory judgment action and the defendant could have capped the legal expenses by having the land deal closed and the declaratory judgment action dismissed.

<p class="p4"><b>One may contract to convey property in future, conditioned upon one's acquisition of title thereto.</b> Northington-Munger Pratt Co. v. Farmers' Gin &amp; Whse. Co., 119 Ga. 851, 47 S.E. 200, 100 Am. St. R. 210 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Waiver of alimony conditioned on spouse's compliance with agreement was conditional contract.</b> - Fact that wife and husband executed written agreement in which she waived alimony and other claims, conditional upon his compliance with terms of agreement would not preclude her from obtaining temporary alimony, where condition of agreement required that he pay $50.00 in cash, and this amount was not paid or tendered. Fulenwider v. Fulenwider, 188 Ga. 856, 5 S.E.2d 20 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Offer to pay upon receipt of possession and title not conditional upon vendor's acquiring title.</b> - Written offer of $1,000.00 for a described gin outfit and to pay for the gin outfit upon other party giving possession and good title, when duly accepted, is an absolute contract of bargain and sale and not conditional upon vendor being able to acquire title so as to make delivery. Northington-Munger Pratt Co. v. Farmers' Gin &amp; Whse. Co., 119 Ga. 851, 47 S.E. 200, 100 Am. St. R. 210 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stipulation in note for attorney's fees ordinarily not unconditional contract.</b> - Stipulation in promissory note to pay attorney's fees is not, and by law cannot ordinarily be made an unconditional contract; for the payment of attorney's fees is absolutely conditioned upon timely service of notice required by law. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Purvis, 6 Ga. App. 275, 65 S.E. 35 (1909); Pendergrast v. Greeson, 6 Ga. App. 47, 64 S.E. 282 (1909), for other cases, see 4 Cum. Dig. 38.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Time of the essence" clause.</b> - Plaintiff's contention that a "time of the essence clause" warranted contract's expiration upon failure to close realty sale on date specified was without merit, since there was no expiration date in the contract and no clause imposing a condition of closing by the date specified. Instead, contract's provisions merely bound the parties to timely performance or response for breach. Separk v. Caswell Bldrs., Inc., 209 Ga. App. 713, 434 S.E.2d 502 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff must allege or excuse performance of any condition precedent.</b> - When plaintiff's right to recover on contract depends on condition precedent to be performed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff, must allege and prove performance of such condition precedent, or allege sufficient legal excuse for its nonperformance. Daniel v. Dalton News Co., 48 Ga. App. 772, 173 S.E. 727 (1934); Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Accident Ass'n v. Hulme, 57 Ga. App. 876, 197 S.E. 85 (1938), later appeal, 60 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When performance of condition precedent is in issue, court to instruct, without request, on statute.</b> - When in suit on written contract, sole contested issue was whether or not admitted condition precedent of contract had been performed, it was duty of court, without request, to instruct jury as to substance of legal rules embodied in the statutes controlling conditional contracts and conditions precedent. Rice v. Harris, 52 Ga. App. 42, 182 S.E. 404 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Independent covenants in contract.</b> - In a suit by a manufacturer against a mill for breach of contract, it was error to direct a verdict for the mill. The manufacturer's obligation to pay for tufted yarn and the mill's obligation to return unused yarn and backing were independent covenants, not dependent ones; thus, a jury was authorized to find that the manufacturer's breach did not excuse the mill's breach.

<p class="p4"><b>Issue of severability of contract is determined by intention of parties,</b> as evidenced by the terms of the contract. Horne v. Drachman, 247 Ga. 802, 280 S.E.2d 338 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Whether contract is upon one consideration important in ascertaining parties' intent.</b> - If contract is upon one consideration, this fact is of great importance in determining whether parties intended contract to be entire or severable. Bearden Mercantile Co. v. Madison Oil Co., 128 Ga. 695, 58 S.E. 200 (1907); Spalding County v. Chamberlain &amp; Co., 130 Ga. 649, 61 S.E. 533 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract of guaranty as entire or divisible, depending on when consideration passes.</b> - There is entire consideration in guaranty contract when all of it passes at time of execution of contract, but when guaranty is to apply not only to indebtedness already incurred, but as well to future obligations, it is divisible and separable. Haynie v. First Nat'l Bank, 117 Ga. App. 766, 162 S.E.2d 27 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Global settlement agreements would tend to be entire rather than severable;</b> thus, the trial court erred in ruling that an agreement was severable since appellee's agreement to execute the mutual releases provided part of the consideration for appellant's agreement to pay money.

<p class="p4"><b>Courts are not bound by severability provisions in antenuptial agreements.</b> - Husband's argument that an antenuptial agreement contained a severability clause and that, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-8(a), the failure to abide by the portion of the agreement concerning attachment of lists showing property owned or held did not void the entire agreement was without merit; the trial court was not bound by the language of the agreement as to severability, but the question was whether there was a misrepresentation or nondisclosure of a material fact.

<p class="p4"><b>Where contract is entire, purchaser cannot accept part of goods and reject remainder.</b> - Where purchaser rejects part of goods sold under an entire contract, because rejected goods are of quality inferior to those contracted for, purchaser is not bound for full amount of agreed price, but is to be treated as if the purchaser had accepted goods of quality inferior to that covered by express warranty.

Hunnicutt &amp; Bellingrath Co. v. Van Hoose, 111 Ga. 518, 36 S.E. 669 (1900).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Employment contracts.</b> - It was a significant indication of the parties' intent that the employment agreement did not contain a severability clause; thus, the contract was obviously intended to be entire, and the defective provisions go to the essential elements of the contract: the duration of the contract and the employee's period of employment and salary were not subsidiary to the essential purpose of the contract. Therefore, the indefinite statements regarding the employee's duties, the term of the employee's employment, and the employee's salary made the contract unenforceable. Key v. Naylor, Inc., 268 Ga. App. 419, 602 S.E.2d 192 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract containing mutual, legal promises and illegal promises is severable and former are enforceable.</b> - Where contract contains mutual, binding, legal promises independent of two allegedly illegal, void provisions, the contract is severable, and legal portions are not annulled by illegal ones and can be enforced. Martell v. Atlanta Biltmore Hotel Corp., 114 Ga. App. 646, 152 S.E.2d 579 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the settlement agreement did not consist of a single promise based on a single consideration, but rather was founded on a legal consideration containing a promise to do several things or to refrain from doing several things and only the promise regarding college education payments was legally unenforceable, the remaining promises, that were not illegal, remained valid. Charles v. Leavitt, 264 Ga. 160, 442 S.E.2d 241 (1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Lowe v. Termplan, Inc., 144 Ga. App. 671, 242 S.E.2d 268 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A vehicle loaner agreement between a garage and the garage's customer could be severed to eliminate the waiver by the customer of the garage's liability insurance, which would violate both statute and public policy, and allow the remainder of the contract, which did not violate a statute or public policy, to remain enforceable.

<p class="p4"><b>Statement containing doctor's and hospital's accounts does not necessarily render them indivisible.</b> - Mere presentation by hospital to patient of single statement containing account of doctor and account of hospital does not necessarily merge account of doctor into indivisible part of account of hospital, and, upon failure of defendant to pay either or both accounts, doctor or hospital may subsequently sue in doctor's or hospital's own name for value of doctor's or hospital's services, and this is true even though in meantime either may have brought suit in their own name and recovered for their services only.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Option to purchase not severable from unenforceable contract.</b> - A trial court erred in finding that a lease-purchase agreement was enforceable because, though it satisfied the statute of frauds, it was invalid for failure of consideration in that the lessee/proposed purchaser never paid the rent owed nor any of the property taxes, which not only invalidated the agreement but voided the purchase option under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-8(a). Further, the trial court erred in holding that the lessee/proposed purchaser was entitled to specific performance of the agreement based on repairs made since there was no legal authority to support the trial court's proposition that part performance of an otherwise unenforceable written agreement, as modified by subsequent oral agreements between the parties, transformed it into an enforceable parol contract.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract with multiple promises based upon multiple considerations severable.</b> - Although an arbitration provision in an employment agreement was found to be unenforceable because the agreement was not initialed by all of the signatories, as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-9-2(c)(9), the remainder of the agreement was enforceable because the agreement was severable from the arbitration clause; it was found that the contract was severable under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-8(a) because the contract contained multiple promises based upon multiple consideration. ISS Int'l Serv. Sys. v. Widmer, 264 Ga. App. 55, 589 S.E.2d 820 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Causes of action accrue from time to time as services rendered under severable contract.</b> - Where account grew out of implied undertakings that amounted to severable contract, it follows that rights of action accrued and statute of limitation began to run as services were rendered and charges were made from time to time on the account. Yeargin v. Bramblett, 115 Ga. App. 862, 156 S.E.2d 97 (1967). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the arbitration agreements contained a central promise, favored by federal law, to arbitrate their employment agreement, and an ancillary agreement to initiate arbitration claims within a year, the court inferred from the nature and structure of the agreement that the parties intended for the promises to be separate, so the agreement to arbitrate was severable from the agreement to initiate arbitration within a year, and on this basis the agreements between the parties to arbitrate the dispute had to be enforced unless there was an independent state law basis for refusing to enforce the contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Provision regarding payment of development impact fees severable.</b> - Trial court did not err by denying a county's motion for summary judgment and concluding that the county's obligation to provide water and sewer lines under a 2006 agreement was not affected by the Georgia Court of Appeal's decision in another case invalidating the prepayment of development impact fees under a similar agreement because the invalid portion of the contract regarding the impact fees was severable under the agreement, which included an explicit severability clause. Effingham County v. Roach, 329 Ga. App. 805, 764 S.E.2d 600 (2014), overruled on other grounds, Rivera v.

<p class="p4"><b>Amusement machine location lease agreement.</b> - Lease was severable. The sum to be paid was not fixed but varied based on the revenue generated by the game machines; the three different locations could operate independently of one another under the lease so separate causes lay for each breach.

<p class="p4"><b>Class action waiver contained in unenforceable jury trial waiver was not severable.</b> - In a bank customer's action alleging that a bank's charges for overdraft of ATM funds were usurious interest, the customer agreements' waiver of jury trials were not enforceable because the agreements' class-action waiver was not an independent provision and was contained in the unenforceable jury trial waiver provision, it was not severable.

<p class="p4"><b>Contract was severable and enforceable.</b> - Option contract, in which potential buyers of hotel were given a 60-day option to obtain financing in return for $10,000, was severable and enforceable; buyers were not allowed to escape contract obligations for lack of a specified interest rate in contract. Bulloch South, Inc. v. Gosai, 250 Ga. App. 170, 550 S.E.2d 750 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-8(a), it was proper to sever an illegal limiting provision of arbitration clause and to then compel arbitration of discrimination claims because the employment agreement contained a severability clause and Georgia law provided that a valid part of a contract was not invalidated by a separate part that was unenforceable and it was the intent of the parties to allow severance.

<p class="p4"><b>Running of limitation.</b> - An action alleging that defendant company breached a sales representative agreement by removing areas from the representative's territory and by repeatedly reducing the commission rate below that provided in the agreement was not time barred as to sales within the six-year limitation period prior to the suit, even though the removal of territory and rate reduction occurred more than six years before the suit was brought, since the commissions were not due until sales were consummated.

<p class="p10">(1) If such note or other evidence of indebtedness provides for attorney's fees in some specific percent of the principal and interest owing thereon, such provision and obligation shall be valid and enforceable up to but not in excess of 15 percent of the principal and interest owing on said note or other evidence of indebtedness; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Legislative intent</b> behind the enactment of O.C.G.A. 13-1-11 has been fulfilled so long as a debtor has been informed that the debtor has 10 days from receipt of notice within which to pay principal and interest without incurring any liability for attorney fees. Trust Assoc. v. Snead, 253 Ga. App. 475, 559 S.E.2d 502 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Constitutionality.</b> - Supreme Court of Georgia held that O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 bears a rational relationship to the purpose for which the statute was intended, namely to provide debtors with the opportunity to avoid the contractual obligation to pay the creditor's attorney fees by allowing the debtor a last chance to pay the balance of the debt and avoid litigation. Austin v. Bank of Am., N.A., 293 Ga. 42, 743 S.E.2d 399 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Term "principal,"</b> as used by the drafters of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11, refers only to the principal amount owing on the note in question. ITT Com. Fin. Corp. v. Fisher, 690 F. Supp. 1021 (N.D. Ga. 1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute merely restricts right which common law recognized.</b> - The statute is not origin of all right to recover attorney's fees in this state; the statute does not give a right where none existed at common law; on the other hand, the statute merely restricted a right which common law recognized. Keating v. Woods-Young Co., 42 Ga. App. 63, 155 S.E. 206 (1930); Global Indus., Inc. v. Harris, 376 F. Supp. 1379 (N.D. Ga. 1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute to be strictly construed.</b> - This statute being in derogation of common law and an abridgment of ordinary right of contract is to be strictly construed, and not to extend to case not clearly falling within its terms. Oliver Typewriter Co. v. Fielder, 7 Ga. App. 525, 67 S.E. 210 (1910) (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Statute, being in derogation of common law, is strictly construed. Ratliffe v. Hartsfield Co., 49 Ga. App. 598, 176 S.E. 151 (1934), rev'd on other grounds, 181 Ga. 663, 184 S.E. 324 (1935) (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section applies to all contracts.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 by operation of law constitutes a part of all contracts incorporated in promissory notes, and all such instruments must be construed in the light of this particular section. Anderson v. Hendrix, 175 Ga. App. 720, 334 S.E.2d 697 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section inapplicable in eminent domain proceeding.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 was intended to apply only in default situations where an indebtedness is collected by or through an attorney after maturity, and the provision in a deed that a bank sought to enforce for reasonable attorney fees incurred as the result of an eminent domain proceeding in order to protect the bank's security interest in the condemned property was not contemplated by the statutory scheme. Boddy Enters., Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 171 Ga. App. 551, 320 S.E.2d 374 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section inapplicable to exclusive listing contract.</b> - Exclusive listing contract is not a "note or other evidence of indebtedness" within the meaning of subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11. O'Brien's Irish Pub, Inc. v. Gerlew Holdings, Inc., 175 Ga. App. 162, 332 S.E.2d 920 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 13-1-11 is inapplicable to personal services contracts.</b> See Holcomb v. Evans, 176 Ga. App. 654, 337 S.E.2d 435 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Given the Georgia Supreme Court's recent guidance on this issue, the district court properly applied O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 in calculating attorneys' fees. Because the guaranties provided for the payment of reasonable attorney's fees without specifying any specific percent, the district court correctly concluded that <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11(a)(2) governed in this case. Asma v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. July 9, 2014)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A lease</b> was an "evidence of indebtedness" within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11. Holmes v. Bogino, 219 Ga. App. 858, 467 S.E.2d 197 (1996). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Phrase "evidence of indebtedness" in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 is construed broadly so as to encompass leases. RadioShack Corp. v. Cascade Crossing II, LLC, 282 Ga. 841, 653 S.E.2d 680 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Debtor afforded opportunity to avoid attorney fees by paying debt.</b> - Law provides additional requirement that notice be given debtor in order that the debtor be afforded an opportunity to avoid attorney fees by paying the debt. GECC v. Brooks, 242 Ga. 109, 249 S.E.2d 596 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section as part of contract providing for attorney's fees.</b> - All contracts to pay attorney's fees incorporated in promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness must be construed in light of the statute, which by operation of law constitutes a part of all such contracts. Hall v. Pratt, 103 Ga. 255, 29 S.E. 764 (1898); Stoner v. Pickett, 115 Ga. 653, 42 S.E. 41 (1902); Booth v. Rosier, 124 Ga. 154, 52 S.E. 327 (1905). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A lessor was correct in asserting a right to recover reasonable attorney fees under the lessor's lease with its lessee as there was no special pleading requirement for the enforcement of such provision, and the lessor prevailed on the lessor's claim for reimbursement for insurance premiums paid over the life of the lease; thus, the case was remanded for further proceedings as to the amount of reasonable fees the lessor could recover. Ranwal Props., LLC v. John H. Harland Co., 285 Ga. App. 532, 646 S.E.2d 730 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fees awarded under paragraph (a)(2).</b> - Attorneys' fees were awarded as designated by paragraph (a)(2) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 where the guaranty agreement provided only for reasonable attorneys' fees without designating any specific percent and the creditor complied with the notice provisions of <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 by way of the creditor's complaint. Westinghouse Credit Corp. v. Hall, 144 Bankr. 568 (S.D. Ga. 1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>There is no law requiring that promise to pay attorney's fee shall be in writing</b> in order to be enforceable. Forsyth Mercantile Co. v. Williams, 36 Ga. App. 130, 135 S.E. 755 (1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's fees are for benefit of note holder, not attorney.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11, contractual provisions for attorney's fees are not for the benefit of attorneys. The fees are in the nature of liquidated damages which inure to the benefit of the holder of the note. Specialty Inv. Corp. v. Village Apt. Assocs., 9 Bankr. 211 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When attorney's fees actually incurred or paid, debtor bound to pay as provided by law.</b> National Acceptance Co. v. Zusmann, 379 F.2d 351 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 975, 88 S. Ct. 478, 19 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1967).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Collection of debt through foreclosure proceedings.</b> - A creditor is entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 if the creditor's attorney collects the debt via a foreclosure proceeding. Kenemer v. First Nat'l Bank, 210 Ga. App. 389, 436 S.E.2d 96 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Curing of default on underlying obligation.</b> - Statutory attorney's fees, as contemplated by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11, do not become a lien against secured property where a default on an underlying obligation is cured and reinstated pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.), as where default in a Chapter 12 case is cured in the confirmed plan of reorganization. In re Davis, 77 Bankr. 313 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment entitling one to attorney fees.</b> - Plaintiff entitled to a summary judgment on a document establishing "evidence of indebtedness," within the meaning of subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 is also entitled to a judgment for attorney fees thereon. Dalcor Mgt., Inc. v. Sewer Rooter, Inc., 205 Ga. App. 681, 423 S.E.2d 419 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasonable attorney fees awarded.</b> - See Chemical Bank v. Grigsby's World of Carpet, Inc. (In re WWG Indus., Inc.), 44 Bankr. 287 (N.D. Ga. 1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney fee award held excessive.</b> - In an action to recover on a promissory note with past due interest, and upon entering summary judgment in favor of the lender, the trial court erred in awarding the lender $10,195.40 in attorney fees in a judgment in which the principal and interest amounted to only $6,259.12; under the formula delineated under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11, such amount was limited to $650.91. Long v. Hogan, 289 Ga. App. 347, 656 S.E.2d 868 (2008), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 516 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defenses to collection action.</b> - Bank was entitled to collect upon the indebtedness of a defaulted loan because the evidence did not support either of the defenses of estoppel or breach of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in opposition to the bank's collection claims. Griffin v. State Bank, 312 Ga. App. 87, 718 S.E.2d 35 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fee award improper when only generalized assertions of connectedness.</b> - While the trial court properly ruled that the defendant's fee recovery was not limited by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 since the litigation was not an attempt to collect on a defaulted debt after maturity, the court abused the court's discretion in awarding the defendant the full amount of requested fees because the court did not require the defendant to shoulder the defendant's burden of proving that the claims were too intertwined to permit the separation of fees, instead allowing the defendant to make only generalized assertions of connectedness. Eagle Jets, LLC v. Atlanta Jet, Inc., 347 Ga. App. 567, 820 S.E.2d 197 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section valid.</b> - Court found no error in the district court's rejection of the company's contention that the attorney's fees provision was an unenforceable penalty; the 15% provisions was permitted under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11, and was not an unenforceable liquidated damages penalty. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. v. Lichty Bros. Constr., Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Aug. 30, 2012)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relief not warranted.</b> - Lender was not entitled to a default judgment for specific performance against borrowers with respect to various loan documents because the lender did not allege that the borrowers breached the provisions or that the lender lacked an adequate legal remedy. Jones v. Bank of Am., N.A.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Apr. 25, 2014)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award not supported by summary judgment affidavit.</b> - Trial court erred by entering a judgment for the specific amount of the debt and attorney fees and case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings to determine a proper award of damages and attorney fees as the affidavit presented by the bank in support of the bank's motion for summary judgment stated the bank relied on an attached payoff exhibit but the exhibit was a payoff quote for a loan issued by a different bank and did not support the damages awarded to the bank. Salas v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 334 Ga. App. 274, 779 S.E.2d 48 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award of fees under foreign jurisdiction law.</b> - Defendants failed to show the court erroneously awarded the bank attorney fees under South Carolina law despite the bank moving for fees under Georgia law because the bank's entitlement to attorney fees stemmed from the terms of the note, and the note was accepted in South Carolina. PNC Bank, N.A. v. GVTG, LLC,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir.

Associates Com. Corp. v. Storey, 192 Ga. App. 199, 384 S.E.2d 265 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice alleging note's face value plus interest, but not exact amount owing, is valid.</b> - Where notice of attorney's fees alleges face value of note in question plus interest, fact that exact amount owing is not also stated does not invalidate the notice. Shier v. Price, 152 Ga. App. 593, 263 S.E.2d 466 (1979); Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. Gainesville Paint &amp; Supply Co., 225 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice effective although providing for 15 percent, while contract provides for ten percent attorney's fees.</b> - Fact that notice states that contract provides for 15 percent attorney's fees instead of ten percent as actually provided for in contract does not destroy efficacy of notice for simple reason that only amount provided in contract under 15 percent could be recovered and compliance with notice by debtor would absolve debtor of obligation to pay fees whatever percentage was.

<p class="p4"><b>Notice not stating date of note not defective where receipt admitted and debtor not misled.</b> - Notice was not defective for failure to set forth date of note where receipt of notice was admitted and where there was only one note or instrument executed and where recipient could not possibly have been misled or prejudiced because date of note was not stated, since in response to notice recipient tendered amount recipient claimed to be due within ten-day period from notice's receipt.

<p class="p4"><b>Complaint provided sufficient notice.</b> - After a restaurant operator stopped making rent payments and the plaintiff sued the defendant for rent payments, re-letting costs, accrued interest, and attorneys' fees under a guaranty agreement, the plaintiff's complaint satisfied the notice requirements for attorneys' fees, but attorneys' fees needed to be recalculated on remand.

<p class="p4"><b>Inadequate, misleading, and insufficient notice.</b> - Trial court erred by awarding the creditors attorney fees pursuant to a promissory note because the creditors failed to provide the debtor and the guarantor sufficient and timely notice of the creditors intent to pursue such fees, as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11(a)(3); the demand letters did not satisfy the requirement because the letters did not state that the guarantor could avoid the guarantor's obligation to pay attorney fees by curing the guarantor's default within ten days of the notice, as required by the statute, and the complaint itself did not satisfy the notice requirement because the complaint incorporated a deficient demand letter, which did not cure the letter's lack of notice, and rather than notifying the guarantor that the guarantor had an opportunity to avoid paying attorney fees by timely curing the default, the complaint stated the opposite, i.e., that the creditors were entitled to recover reasonably incurred attorneys' fees.

<p class="p4">Language in a landlord's complaint asserting that notice of intent to collect attorney's fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11 had been given to the tenant was not only insufficient to notify the tenant that the tenant had an opportunity to avoid paying attorney fees by timely curing the default, but the notice actually stated the opposite, i.e., that the landlord was entitled to the attorney's fees; therefore, the notice was inadequate.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of phraseology.</b> - Although phraseology of pleading may have given rise to construction that no attorney fees would be sought if payment of note was delayed for at least ten days, such an interpretation was patently absurd, and was clearly due to a typographical error which could not reasonably have misled anyone; consequently, the notice constituted a sufficient compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notice requiring payment within ten days of date of notice materially varies from requirements.</b> - Notice that in order to avoid attorney fees, principal and interest must be paid within ten days from date of letter rather than within ten days from date of receipt thereof, is a material variance from statutory requirements and does not constitute substantial compliance with statutory provisions. Gorlin v. First Nat'l Bank, 150 Ga. App. 637, 258 S.E.2d 290 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summons with copy of note attached not notice under section.</b> - When plaintiff in suit on note serves maker with summons which has copy of note providing for attorney fees attached, such summons does not constitute notice under the statutes and fees sued for are not part of principal amount in ascertaining jurisdictional amount for justice court.

<p class="p4"><b>Landlord's complaint against tenants.</b> - When recovery of attorney fees was provided for in a lease, but nothing in the landlord's complaint warned the tenants that the tenants had 10 days from receipt of notice to pay the sum owed and avoid attorney fees, a directed verdict for the tenants on the issue of attorney's fees was mandated.

<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient notice given.</b> - Trial court did not err in determining that a creditor gave a debtor and guarantors sufficient notice of the creditor's intention to seek the attorney fees provided by a promissory note and security deed if the creditor used an attorney to collect the indebtedness because the notice sent to the debtor and guarantors referenced O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-11-1, provided notice that the creditor intended to conduct a foreclosure sale, and stated that proceeds of the foreclosure sale would be applied to the creditor's attorney fees as provided in the note and security deed; the notice also explicitly stated that the debtor had ten days from the debtor's receipt of the notice within which to pay principal and interest without incurring any liability for attorney fees.

<p class="p4"><b>Section applies to cases where formal plea of non est factum filed as to endorsement.</b> When note containing endorsement or transfer is introduced in evidence, its factum appears with legal sufficiency. Gray v. Oglesby, 9 Ga. App. 356, 71 S.E. 605 (1911); Wheeler v. Salinger, 33 Ga. App. 300, 125 S.E. 888 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When endorsement is denied on oath, there must be proof of genuineness of endorsement.</b> - Existence of genuine endorsement is essential to plaintiff's case and burden will ordinarily be upon plaintiff as to this issue. Ruby v. Boyett, 19 Ga. App. 516, 91 S.E. 939 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When defendant denies genuineness of endorsement, burden on plaintiff to prove otherwise.</b> - When defendant has, in defendant's plea, denied genuineness of signature of payee transferring check to plaintiff, and alleged that this signature was a forgery, burden is placed on plaintiff to prove genuineness of signature. Buena Vista Loan &amp; Sav. Bank v. Stockdale, 59 Ga. App. 798, 2 S.E.2d 158 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section applicable although endorser's name signed by agent and action is against maker, not endorser.</b> - Rule applies though name of endorser purports to have been signed not by endorser but by endorser's agent or attorney in fact, and though action be not against endorser but against maker. Plea which seems to admit endorsement is not a denial of the endorsement. Habersham v. Lehman, 63 Ga. 380 (1879).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refusal to admit or deny for lack of information not a plea of general issue.</b> - Where fact is peculiarly within knowledge of opposite party, pleader may refuse to admit or deny for lack of information and demand proof of such allegation. Such an answer is not subject to demurrer (now motion to dismiss), nor does it amount to a plea of general issue. Byrom v. Ringe, 83 Ga. App. 234, 63 S.E.2d 235 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Although not specifically alleged, plaintiff presumed holder in due course absent denial by defendant.</b> - Where no endorsement of note sued on by original payee appears in pleadings, nor is it alleged in petition that plaintiff acquired note in due course; but defendants do not question plaintiff's title to instrument and do not deny that plaintiff became holder thereof in due course, it will be presumed that plaintiff was holder in due course by endorsement of payee. Holland v. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 50 Ga. App. 471, 178 S.E. 413 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Denial that one is holder in due course not denial of endorsement's validity under section.</b> - Denial that plaintiff is holder in due course of note is not denial of validity of endorsement, nor does it deny authority of endorser to act in endorsing note as attorney in fact of payee or transferor. Griffin v. Blackshear Bank, 66 Ga. App. 821, 19 S.E.2d 325 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Though signature does not purport to be authorized, failure to deny authenticity is admission.</b> - Although signature, not purporting to be made by any particular agent authorized to act for corporation and not being accompanied by corporate seal, does not import its own authenticity, defendant, by not denying endorsement under oath, conclusively admits its genuineness. Sheffield v. Johnson County Sav. Bank, 2 Ga. App. 221, 58 S.E. 386 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>General denial of general allegation suffices as to subsequent amendment of petition.</b> - Mere general denial, in a plea sworn to by a defendant, of paragraph in plaintiff's petition in which plaintiff alleges merely that plaintiff is owner of choses in action sued on, suffices as denial of subsequent amendment to petition which alleges assignment.

O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 46-4-160.5, which specifically authorized a private right of action for damages against a provider for intentionally and deceptively over charging the customers, prevailed over O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-13, the general statute setting forth the voluntary payment doctrine.

<p class="p4"><b>General presumption that money paid is due and payment voluntary.</b> - General presumption is that when one pays money to another, money is due and payee is entitled thereto, and the payment is voluntarily made by payer, and in action to recover the money back, burden is on payer to show that payment was not due and that money was not paid by payer voluntarily; this rule applies to payment of insurance premiums by insured to insurer.

<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Court's role generally.</b> - When parties disagree only as to the legal meaning of their agreement, the court's role is well-defined. When the language of the agreement is clear, then it is controlling, and the court need look no further. This principle is the obverse of the broad freedom of contract the law grants the parties. Smith v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 639 F.2d 1235 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Existence or nonexistence of ambiguity</b> in a contract is a question of law for the court. Salvatori Corp. v. Rubin, 159 Ga. App. 369, 283 S.E.2d 326 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Under state law whether a contract is ambiguous is to be determined by the court. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 519 F. Supp. 60 (S.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No construction where language plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one meaning.</b> - No construction is required or even permissible when the language employed by the parties in the contract is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation. Franchise Enters., Inc. v. Ridgeway, 157 Ga. App. 458, 278 S.E.2d 33 (1981); Crooks v. Crim, 159 Ga. App. 745, 285 S.E.2d 84 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction and interpretation subject to disposition by summary judgment.</b> - Construction and interpretation of a written contract is matter of law for the court and, therefore, is properly subject to disposition by summary judgment. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where no matter of fact is involved,</b> the construction of a plain and definite contract, if needed, is a matter of law for the court. Crooks v. Crim, 159 Ga. App. 745, 285 S.E.2d 84 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction must be fair and reasonable.</b> - In construing a contract, the court must put a fair and reasonable construction thereon. Smiths' Properties, Inc. v. RTM Enters., Inc., 160 Ga. App. 102, 286 S.E.2d 334 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Jury issue not created by fact of two possible interpretations of contract.</b> - It does not follow that merely because there are two possible interpretations which might be employed in construing a contract, the matter automatically becomes question for jury. If that were true courts would rarely, if ever, construe contracts as the law declares their duty to be. Role and function of courts is higher than that of mere referee. Warrior Constructors, Inc. v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of terms in insurance contract.</b> - Term "landslide" as used in the coverage provisions of an insurance policy did not apply only to natural occurring events, when no such restriction was contained within the policy language and since, inter alia, other clauses listing perils insured against placed specific restrictions on broad terms; to the extent there was any ambiguity in the use of the term landslide, it was interpreted against the insurance company.

<p class="p4"><b>Change in beneficiary in life insurance policy.</b> - As a spouse designated the spouse's child as the beneficiary in an old life insurance policy, the new policy did not invalidate this designation, and questions of material fact remained as to whether the spouse's alleged intent to change beneficiaries was ever effectuated according to the new insurer's regulations, the surviving spouse was not entitled to summary judgment on that spouse's claim to be the beneficiary of the new policy.

<p class="p4"><b>Insured's duty to defend in racial discrimination suit.</b> - Insurer was not required to defend its insureds in a race discrimination suit filed by potential property buyers who alleged that the insureds violated state and federal law by refusing to sell the buyers a lot in a subdivision because the buyers were a bi-racial couple since: (1) the court decided as a matter of law, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-1, that the bodily injury provision of the commercial general liability policy was unambiguous and did not provide coverage because the buyers did not allege that the buyers were physically injured by the insureds' actions; and (2) the court decided as a matter of law, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-1, that the policy's personal injury provision, which applied to personal injuries sustained when a right of occupancy was invaded, was unambiguous and did not provide coverage because the buyers were not present occupants of the land at issue.

<p class="p4"><b>Pollution exclusion provisions ambiguous.</b> - In an action brought by a lessor against a former lessee, a dry cleaning corporation, for indemnification for remediation expenses incurred in cleaning up the contaminated shopping center property vacated by the lessee, the trial court properly refused to examine a pollution liability exclusion endorsement in a vacuum and, rather, considered that language in concert with other policy language addressing coverage of property damage arising out of the discharge of pollutants and thereby found that an umbrella policy provided coverage for quick, abrupt, and accidental discharges of pollutants. The trial court properly determined that the inconsistent language of the pollution liability exclusion and an amendatory endorsement were ambiguous as the amendatory endorsement narrowed the scope of pollution liability exclusion by exempting from it discharges that were quick, abrupt, and accidental; but the pollution liability exclusion endorsement broadened the scope of exclusion by extending the exclusion to any discharge.

<p class="p4"><b>Franchise agreement did not cover county's liability to power company for movement of power lines.</b> - Trial court properly found that a power company was entitled to compensation from a county for the taking of the company's private property easements, including the costs of relocating the electrical power and distribution poles, when the county widened a road because a 1929 franchise agreement did not apply to situations where the power company was forced by the county to relocate power transmission lines and poles that the company originally erected on private property easements.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Exclusion in insurance policy for assault and battery.</b> - When an injured patron was struck in the nose by a beer bottle thrown in the insured's bar, the injured patron contended that the insured was liable because the bar and the bar's employees failed to prevent the bottle thrower's attack and the injured patron claimed to have suffered serious injury and disfigurement, but the insurer claimed that the insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify the insured because the incident fell within the policy's assault and battery exclusion; the court held that the portion of the policy addressing assault and battery was not intended to exclude coverage for a bodily injury claim arising out of an assault and battery committed by a patron, as any other interpretation would have rendered certain language in the policy meaningless.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction of guaranty contract was matter of law for court.</b> - As no matter of fact was involved, the construction of a guaranty was a matter of law for the court, which found that the guaranty executed by a guarantor contained a very broad waiver clause which plainly and unambiguously waived any claims the guarantor might have had against the debtor and extended to claims arising in equity, or under contract, statute, or common law; the waiver obviously included a claim under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-7-41, so the trial court erred by denying summary judgment to the debtor and other defendants, and erred as well in granting summary judgment in favor of the guarantor.

<p class="p4"><b>Where parties stipulate contract is plain and definite, construction is matter for court.</b> - Where parties stipulate to court that contract involved is plain and definite, construction of the contract is matter of law to be submitted to court.

<p class="p4"><b>Whether instrument is deed or bill of sale, where unambiguous, is for court determination.</b> - It was error for court to submit to jury question as to whether instrument sued on was deed or bill of sale.

<p class="p4"><b>Claim to succession to co-owner's right to repurchase stock.</b> - After applying the rules of construction, and looking at the extrinsic evidence, no ambiguity remained in a contract entered into between the two owners of a closely held corporation. The provision which provided that the "benefits" of the contract inured to the heirs and assigns of the parties did not entitle the heirs and assigns of one of the co-owners, who had entered into the agreement for purposes of enabling the owner to retire and whose stock was redeemed by the company, to exercise the "privilege" of repurchase given to that co-owner by another provision. Jordan v. Smith, 596 F. Supp. 1295 (N.D. Ga. 1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of shareholder's agreement to sell stock.</b> - Because a shareholder agreement containing a proposal from one shareholder to sell shares to the other three was clear and unambiguous as: (1) there was nothing in the agreement allowing a shareholder to disregard a conditional offer; and (2) the agreement created an enforceable obligation requiring another shareholder to give written notice as to how that shareholder elected to proceed within 60 days of receiving the first shareholder's offer, enforcement of the agreement was properly decided via summary judgment in favor of the selling shareholder.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Indemnity provision between shareholder and corporate entity.</b> - Order granting summary judgment to an LLC was upheld, when, under the plain terms of an indemnity provision between the LLC and one of its shareholders, the shareholder was liable for costs associated with defending claims made by its agent against the LLC; but, the shareholder was not liable for costs associated with a suit over the payment of commissions, as such did not relate to the marketing and sales efforts covered by the indemnity clause and undertaken by the shareholder.

<p class="p4"><b>Guaranty.</b> - In Georgia, the enforcement of unambiguous terms in a written agreement, such as a guaranty, presents an issue of law properly decided by summary judgment. Congress Fin. Corp. v. Commercial Technology, Inc., 910 F. Supp. 637 (N.D. Ga. 1995), aff'd, 74 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir. 1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action on a guaranty, because the plain and unambiguous terms of the guaranty and the guaranty's addendum only obligated the guarantor to the lease obligations of the original tenant, the guarantor's subsidiary, and not the obligations of a new tenant, the guarantor was properly absolved of any liability to the landlord for the obligations of that new tenant, entitling the guarantor to summary judgment on that issue. Highwoods Realty L.P.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>v. Cmty. Loans of Am., Inc., 288 Ga. App. 226, 653 S.E.2d 807 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err by finding a guarantor personally liable on a promissory note because the trial court correctly found that the language of the promissory note, the unconditional guaranty, and the modification to the promissory note were unambiguous, and since the documents' provisions were clear, the trial court's proper role was to apply the terms as written; in the guaranty, the guarantor expressly waived all notices or defenses to which the guarantor could be entitled under the guaranty, to the extent permitted by law, and because the guarantor failed to assert any defense based upon an alleged incompetency to enter into a contract at the time the guarantor executed the guaranty, and because the guarantor failed to show that the guaranty's broad waiver of defenses was prohibited by statute or public policy, the guarantor was bound thereby.

<p class="p4"><b>Arbitration clause.</b> - Based on the clear terms of an arbitration clause in a timber harvesting contract between a landowner and a timber harvesting contractor, the trial court did not err in compelling the contractor into arbitration as the contract had not expired, arbitration of a tort claim was not involved, but the language within the contract clearly covered the issues the landowner sought to arbitrate. Pickle v. Rayonier Forest Res., L.P., 282 Ga. App. 295, 638 S.E.2d 344 (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 218 (Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Upon admitting a parent to a nursing home, an adult child's signature on an arbitration agreement did not bind the parent because the child was not the parent's agent by virtue of being the child and there was no evidence that the parent had authorized the child to act for the parent as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-6-1.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury construction necessary where contract specifications apparently interpreted in various ways during performance.</b> - Where standard specifications were by stipulation made part of contract, and evidence shows that as applied to fact situations existing during course of construction various items contained in these stipulations were given various interpretations, not only as between plaintiff and defendant, but also as between certain of defendant's engineers, evidence warranted instruction submitting construction of contract to jury.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury instruction on how to interpret contractual ambiguity harmless error.</b> - Although it was improper for a district court to instruct a jury on how to interpret contractual ambiguities without first having found an insurance contract to be ambiguous as a matter of law, the error was harmless because the court correctly defined the policy term "hidden from view," which was the key issue in the case.

<p class="p4"><b>Where contract's meaning not in issue, submission to jury without prior court construction immaterial.</b> - Where construction or meaning of contract is not in issue, it is immaterial that superior court submitted contract to jury without first placing construction or interpretation upon the contract.

<p class="p4"><b>No new trial where court submits contract construction to jury and jury properly construes contract.</b> - While court has duty to construe written contracts, new trial will not be granted for failure to discharge this duty if contract is submitted to jury and properly construed by the jury, especially when, if contract had been properly construed by court, construction would have been adverse to plaintiff in error and result would have been the same as reached by the jury in the jury's verdict.

<p class="p4"><b>Employment contracts.</b> - It was undisputed that an employment contract provided that the agreement would be terminated "[o]ne year from the date set forth in this Agreement [August 1, 1979]." Since this provision was clear and unambiguous, the trial court did not err in finding that the employee's employment had terminated by the terms of the contract, notwithstanding continued payments to the employee as "fees for professional services." Medical Oncology Hematology Group v. Goldklang, 183 Ga. App. 788, 360 S.E.2d 41 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Upon a de novo review of the plain terms outlined in an employment contract, a former employer was not entitled to receive commission payments from its former employee, a licensed sales agent, for deals closed with the employee's subsequent employer, as any contrary reading would result in an unenforceable contract, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 43-40-19(c); hence, summary judgment was properly granted to the employee on that issue, and the former employer's claim for money had and received also failed.

<p class="p4">In a breach of contract action filed by an employee, who was a third-party beneficiary to an employment contract with a contractor, the trial court erred in granting the employee summary judgment as: (1) under the plain language of the employment agreement at issue between the parties, as well as the county's personnel policy, the contractor was authorized to terminate the employee based on the employee's inability or unfitness to perform the assigned duties due to an injury; and (2) the employee could not perform all the job's requirements.

<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the former employee's motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of an employment agreement and properly granted the former employer's motion for summary judgment on that claim because the former employee was not entitled to any future compensation from the former employer after the former employee's termination as the former employee and the former employer entered into an employment agreement with an initial six-month term which was terminable at will.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Adjudication by summary judgment held improper.</b> - Summary judgment was inappropriate in a breach of fiduciary duty action which centered around a verbal settlement agreement since material fact issues remained as to whether: (1) a company's offer to buy the minority shareholders' stock required a written purchase agreement; (2) the parties agreed to all material terms; and (3) a note signed by one of the minority shareholders had been cancelled. McKenna v. Capital Res. Partners, IV, L.P., 286 Ga. App. 828, 650 S.E.2d 580 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 752, 763 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Amendments to pleadings did not negate application of contract.</b> - In a wrongful death and breach of contract action wherein the plaintiff did not prevail, the trial court erred by awarding the plaintiff attorney fees under an aircraft purchase agreement (APA) because the defendant was the prevailing party and under the fee-shifting clause of the agreement, the prevailing party was entitled to an award of attorney fees and plaintiff's amendments to the complaint to remove references relying on the APA for liability did not alter that the APA governed the parties' transaction.

<p class="p10">(2) Words generally bear their usual and common signification; but technical words, words of art, or words used in a particular trade or business will be construed, generally, to be used in reference to this peculiar meaning. The local usage or understanding of a word may be proved in order to arrive at the meaning intended by the parties; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) The custom of any business or trade shall be binding only when it is of such universal practice as to justify the conclusion that it became, by implication, a part of the contract, except in regard to those transactions covered by Title 11; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) The construction which will uphold a contract in whole and in every part is to be preferred, and the whole contract should be looked to in arriving at the construction of any part; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) If the construction is doubtful, that which goes most strongly against the party executing the instrument or undertaking the obligation is generally to be preferred; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) The rules of grammatical construction usually govern, but to effectuate the intention they may be disregarded; sentences and words may be transposed, and conjunctions substituted for each other. In extreme cases of ambiguity, where the instrument as it stands is without meaning, words may be supplied; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) When a contract is partly printed and partly written, the latter part is entitled to most consideration; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) Estates and grants by implication are not favored; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>1. Application in General</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of "applicant".</b> - Appellate court erred by concluding that a guaranty was unenforceable for not sufficiently identifying the name of the principal debtor and thus failing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-5-30(2), because the word applicant, bearing its usual and common meaning, identified the company applying for credit and, therefore, clearly identified the company as the principal debtor. Lafarge Bldg. Materials, Inc. v. Thompson, 295 Ga. 637, 763 S.E.2d 444 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of word "void".</b> - When a bank sought relief from the automatic stay to proceed with a sheriff's sale under a prepetition state court consent judgment that resolved a fraudulent transfer action against the debtor and others by declaring the transfer "void," the court denied the motion as unnecessary. No interest in the property revested in the debtor because, applying rules of contract construction to the consent judgment, and giving the consent judgment a construction that rendered the judgment in compliance with Georgia fraudulent transfer statutes, the court determined that the word "void" meant void as to the bank, not void ab initio. Southeastern Bank v. Allen (In re Allen),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. S.D. Ga. June 5, 2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of employee dishonesty insurance contract provision.</b> - Appellate court properly determined that an insured was only entitled to one cumulative policy limit for a loss due to embezzlement by an employee; upon consideration pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2, the insurance policy in question stated that the insurer would only pay for one occurrence during the policy term, and the acts of the employee constituted one occurrence as defined by the policy. Sherman &amp; Hemstreet, Inc. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 277 Ga. 734, 594 S.E.2d 648 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction impermissible where language capable of only one reasonable interpretation.</b> - No construction is required or even permissible when language employed by parties to contract is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation. R.S. Helms, Inc. v. GST Dev. Co., 135 Ga. App. 845, 219 S.E.2d 458 (1975); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. Stidham, 506 F. Supp. 1182 (M.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, 658 F.2d 1098 (5th Cir. 1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Term "waste" in a royalty fees contract was unambiguous and was properly given the term's plain and ordinary meaning pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2(2). Had the parties intended the contract to include solid waste, a term commonly used in the waste management industry, the parties could have inserted the word "solid" before the word "waste," but the parties did not.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction of waiver provision in contract.</b> - Upon construction of a contract between an independent contractor and a billboard owner under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2, because: (1) it was clear that the contractor did not waive any right to recover against the owner under any possible scenario, but only waived a right to recover against the owner's predecessor for damages if the waiver did not invalidate the insurance coverage; and (2) the contract only waived the owner's liability if the waiver did not invalidate the contractor's insurance, summary judgment was erroneously entered to the owner on grounds that the contractor waived a right to recover from the owner and because the trial court failed to consider whether the waiver invalidated the contractor's insurance. Holmes v. Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc., 284 Ga. App. 474, 644 S.E.2d 311 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>In contract dispute not involving language of contract, parties bound by writing.</b> - In dispute over meaning of contract and subsequent acts of parties during contract's execution, which is not over language of contract, party is bound by what has been reduced to writing. R.S. Helms, Inc. v. GST Dev. Co., 135 Ga. App. 845, 219 S.E.2d 458 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action regarding an alleged breach of an employment contract seeking commissions on deals made by a real estate agent that a former real estate broker alleged it was entitled to, after a plain reading of the unambiguous contract, the trial court erred in entering summary judgment against the agent, finding that the agent owed the broker commissions as to one of two contested deals, because: (1) the agent closed the deal with that client after terminating employment with the broker; and (2) it was undisputed that the agent had not agreed to share commissions with the broker on deals struck after the agent left the broker's employ; thus, since summary judgment was properly entered in the agent's favor regarding commissions paid to the agent as to the second of the two contested clients, the broker was not entitled to litigation costs under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rules of construction invoked by Court of Appeals only where raised by assignment of error.</b> - Whatever may be application of rules of construction of contracts as a whole on issues before trial court, such application is invoked by Court of Appeals only to extent, directly or indirectly, that it may be raised by assignment of error, preserving for review any or all of those issues. Boston Ins. Co. v. Harmon, 66 Ga. App. 383, 18 S.E.2d 84 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plain language of contract upheld.</b> - In a breach of contract action filed by an employee, who was a third-party beneficiary to an employment contract with a contractor, the trial court erred in granting the employee summary judgment as: (1) under the plain language of the employment agreement at issue between the parties, as well as the county's personnel policy, the contractor was authorized to terminate the employee based on the employee's inability or unfitness to perform the assigned duties due to an injury; and (2) the employee could not perform all the job's requirements. Am. Water Serv. USA v. McRae, 286 Ga. App. 762, 650 S.E.2d 304 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 761 (Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a declaratory judgment action between a water utility and residents of a subdivision, given that the residents had standing to sue on a contract for the provision of water services as incidental beneficiaries, the trial court erred in finding that the utility was charging the appropriate rates thereunder; but, the utility was allowed to increase the utility's minimum annual fee and, given the clear and ambiguous language of the contract, enforce a restrictive covenant. Alday v. Decatur Consol. Water Servs., 289 Ga. App. 902, 658 S.E.2d 476 (2008). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a condominium association member in an action by the association, seeking to resolve a dispute between the parties as to the proper manner of assessing expenses for the common elements of the condominium development as the declaration restricted limited common element expenses to a special assessment among the assigned unit owners, apart from the general common expenses that were to be divided among all unit owners; that interpretation of the declaration reflected the meaning of the entire document pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2(4). Museum Tower Condo. Ass'n v. Children's Museum of Atlanta, Inc., 297 Ga. App. 84, 676 S.E.2d 448 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a breach of contract suit between a licensee of certain patents and a licensor, the licensor's sale of the licensor's assets did not violate the parties' agreement because the plain language of the agreement permitted a sale to a certain entity without notice to the licensee, and the licensee's interpretation of the contract to the contrary did not involve construing the contract as a whole, as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2(4). Ip Co., LLC v. Cellnet Tech., Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga. Sept. 28, 2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly granted a condominium association summary judgment in a premises liability action because interpreting the condominium association documents established that the association did not have a duty to remove snow and ice from the common walkway where the resident fell. Scrocca v. Ashwood Condominium Ass'n, 326 Ga. App. 226, 756 S.E.2d 308 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Federal court construing language not previously construed in Georgia to use rules of the Georgia Code.</b> - Where interpretation of contractual language has been differently construed by courts of different jurisdictions but not previously construed by Georgia courts, thus making construction doubtful, rules of interpretation of contracts, as found in the Georgia Code are properly applicable by federal court. Boston Ins. Co. v. Gable, 352 F.2d 368 (5th Cir. 1965).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract between spouses to settle question of alimony subject to usual rules of construction.</b> - Where contract between husband and wife in divorce suit was entered into for purpose of settling question of alimony, the contract's meaning and effect should be determined according to usual rules for construction of contracts, the cardinal rule being to ascertain intention of parties. Brown v. Farkas, 195 Ga. 653, 25 S.E.2d 411 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Entirety of an agreement should be looked to in arriving at the construction of any part; a requirement in a divorce settlement agreement that the husband pay money to the wife, with or without a sale of the marital home, was not conditional. Horwitz v. Weil, 275 Ga. 467, 569 S.E.2d 515 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of settlement agreement in divorce actions.</b> - Language of second divorce settlement agreement that stated certain property belonged to the former husband and was not marital property subject to division, and that the former husband and the former wife agreed to release each other from any and all obligations whatsoever against each other unambiguously meant that the former wife released the former husband from any claim to any equity interest in the property despite the fact that an earlier divorce settlement agreement provided for the wife to receive an equity interest in the property under certain circumstances. Barnett v. Platz, 261 Ga. App. 51, 581 S.E.2d 682 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Decedent died before changing the beneficiary of an IRA, the decedent's ex-spouse. A provision in a divorce settlement agreement stating that the ex-spouse relinquished all claims to any IRAs titled in the decedent's name was sufficiently broad to waive the ex-spouse's beneficiary designation and to release the ex-spouse's expectancy interest in the IRA; thus, the proceeds of the IRA belonged to the decedent's estate. Young v. Stump, 294 Ga. App. 351, 669 S.E.2d 148 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Visitation provision of consent order.</b> - It was error under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2 to rule that under a consent order, a father was entitled to an extension of holiday visitation into a weekend preceding or following a holiday. No provision of the consent order allowed a merger of holiday visitation with standard weekend visitation; since the consent order contained specific, unambiguous language governing how holiday visitation was to be exercised, that language controlled whenever the father elected to take advantage of holiday visitation instead of weekend visitation. Immel v. Immel, 298 Ga. App. 424, 680 S.E.2d 505 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of divorce settlement agreement with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>periodic alimony.</b> - Summary judgment was properly granted to a former husband in his declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination that his obligation to make "periodic alimony" payments for his former wife's car payments pursuant to the parties' divorce settlement agreement ceased upon the wife's remarriage pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 19-6-5(b), as the settlement agreement was clear and unambiguous in its designation of certain payments as a form of periodic alimony rather than as equitable distribution; contract interpretation principles under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-2-2(4) and 13-2-3 supported that interpretation of the agreement. Crosby v. Lebert, 285 Ga. 297, 676 S.E.2d 192 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Meaning and effect of will, contract, or pleading to be ascertained by language employed</b> in document's preparation. Brantley Co. v. Briscoe, 246 Ga. 310, 271 S.E.2d 356 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Applying Georgia's rules of contract construction, derived from statute and case law, an ambiguity in a multi-bank loan participation agreement was resolved in the lead bank's favor because one section overrode another on the issue of whether to sell the loan in that the contract specifically addressed that issue and so prevailed over conflicting general language.

<p class="p4"><b>Contract to be construed as whole and no part discarded if avoidable preference for upholding contracts.</b> - When a tenant which terminated the tenant's lease early and agreed to pay the landlord the difference between the tenant's rental obligation and rent the landlord was able to obtain from a third party this agreement was a guaranty from which the tenant had been discharged, the landlord was entitled to partial summary judgment on the landlord's breach of contract claim in the landlord's suit to enforce the agreement, because the agreement was not a guaranty subject to the discharge provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-7-20 et seq., as the tenant did not agree to be answerable for the debt of another but, instead, agreed to continue the tenant's rental obligation to the landlord, subject to any credit the tenant might be entitled to for rent the landlord received from a third party, and the use of the phrase "Lessee guarantees" in the contract did not make it a guaranty because, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2(4), the whole contract was to be looked at in determining the meaning of any part.

<p class="p4">Trial court acted properly in determining whether the property buyer was entitled to specific performance of the property seller's obligation in the purchase and sales agreement to execute a restrictive covenant by examining the whole contract in determining whether the parties intended that the obligation to execute the restrictive covenant survive the real estate closing as the parties had agreed in an addendum signed at the time of the closing that they intended unfulfilled obligations under the agreement to survive the closing, and only by examining the whole contract was the trial court able to determine the parties' intention that the obligation to execute the restrictive covenant survived the closing.

<p class="p4"><b>Contemporaneous written agreements properly construed together.</b> - In a breach of contract action arising from a guaranty agreement between a guarantor and a retail space owner, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in the owner's favor, as the court properly construed contemporaneous written agreements, which were executed on the same date, at the same time, and at the same location, despite a misnomer contained therein, as such did not render the agreement unenforceable. Thus, it was not erroneous for the court to correct an obvious error in the agreement, specifically, the failure to substitute one entity's name for another as the parties intended, and interpret the guaranty accordingly.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intention of parties as controlling factor.</b> - Cardinal rule of construction is to ascertain intention of parties to contract, and this is to be gathered from entire contract, considering each provision in connection with others, and not giving contract construction which entirely neutralizes one provision if the provision is susceptible of another which gives effect to all provisions. Holcim (US), Inc. v. AMDG, Inc., 265 Ga. App. 818, 596 S.E.2d 197 (2004). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Cardinal rule of contract construction is to ascertain the intent of the parties; where a sublease was ambiguous regarding a sublessee's obligation to pay operating expenses due under the master lease, fact questions remained as to the parties' intent, and a trial court erred in entering summary judgment for the sublessee but not in denying the sublessor's summary judgment motion.

<p class="p4"><b>To effectuate intent of parties, court to consider whole instrument and surrounding circumstances.</b> - In order to ascertain intention of parties, language of agreement should be considered in light of attendant and surrounding circumstances.

<p class="p4"><b>Intent of parties to settlement agreement.</b> - In reviewing the communications between the parties, and given that the courts had a duty to construe and enforce contracts as made and not to make contracts for the parties, because those communications led to a binding agreement between the parties, the trial court erred in concluding that the parties had not reached a settlement agreement. Mealer v. Kennedy, 290 Ga. App. 432, 659 S.E.2d 809 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the former employee's motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of an employment agreement and properly granted the former employer's motion for summary judgment on that claim because the former employee was not entitled to any future compensation from the former employer after the former employee's termination as the former employee and the former employer entered into an employment agreement with an initial six-month term which was terminable at will.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Employee not entitled to commission payments.</b> - Trial court properly denied the former employee's motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of an employment agreement and properly granted the former employer's motion for summary judgment on that claim because the plain language of the agreement required the former employee to make sales in order to obtain a commission, and the former employee was not entitled to any commission as the former employee had not made any sales during the operative time period of the agreement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Divorce settlement.</b> - Trial court properly found that the term "gross income" in the parties' divorce settlement agreement was ambiguous, and, in construing the agreement against the father as the obligor, that the parties intended for child support to be based on Georgia's Child Support Guidelines, and that, by assigning earned income to the father's professional corporation, thereby substantially understating the father's gross income, the father wilfully violated the conditions of the settlement agreement; the father's "gross income" significantly exceeded Form W-2 wages, and the father's computation of child support based only on the father's Form W-2 salary created a child support deficiency.

<p class="p4"><b>Debtor's objection to creditor's claims.</b> - Two Chapter 13 debtors' objection to a creditor's claim, which lumped both a secured amount and an unsecured amount into one claim, was well-taken; when the canons of construction that applied to such contracts, including that concerning ambiguity in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-3 and that concerning the parties' intent in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2 were applied to the two agreements under which the creditor had financed the debtors' purchase of a house trailer and then extended additional credit to the debtors to allow them to move the trailer to a new location, it was clear that only the original transaction was intended to result in a secured obligation.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intent of parties in lease.</b> - Trial court was authorized to construe commercial lease and shareholder buyout agreements between a lessor and a lessee together as multiple documents executed during the course of a single transaction; in so doing, the court's finding that the agreement was linked to the lease's 10-year term upheld the contract as a whole, reflected the parties' intent as expressed in the testimony and documentary evidence offered at trial, and was supported by all the attendant and surrounding circumstances.

<p class="p4">After applying the rules of contract construction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-2-2 and 13-2-3, the Court of Appeals of Georgia upheld an order granting summary judgment to a lessee, as it was not required to pay the lessee's portion of security related costs under the terms of the lease, according to the Common Area Costs formula contained therein; hence, the lessee was authorized to refuse to pay those costs without being in breach of the lease agreement.

<p class="p4"><b>Lease agreement could be supplemented with implied terms.</b> - Where a provision in a golf course lease between a Chapter 11 debtor and a city provided that "authorized representatives" of the city and the debtor could use rounds at the golf course at no charge to entertain sponsors and clients and for other business purposes, the lease was not unenforceable due to vagueness because it was possible for the court to determine the reasonable intention of the parties by asking them to submit practical suggestions for workable procedures to implement the provision.

<p class="p4"><b>When language susceptible of more than one understanding, intent of parties to be ascertained.</b> - When language of written instrument may be fairly understood in more ways than one, it should be taken in sense put upon the instrument by the parties at time of the instrument's execution, and court will hear evidence as to facts and surroundings.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restrictive covenants upheld because otherwise purchase agreement would be rendered meaningless.</b> - As parties to an asset purchase agreement intended that the buyer acquire the seller's restrictive covenants, and that the seller release its rights in covenants as to its employees who became the seller's employees, a former employee of the seller who became the buyer's employee was bound by covenants. The employee's argument that the buyer purchased, but simultaneously extinguished, the restrictive covenants was rejected because, by purchasing restrictive covenants that it could not enforce, the buyer would have purchased no covenants at all, which would have rendered provisions of the purchase agreement meaningless.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of indemnity provision.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a limited liability company (LLC) and its owners on a corporation's indemnity and guaranty claims as the indemnity provisions in the parties' contract applied only to the corporation's guaranties, while the loan and capital conversion provisions applied to all members of a joint venture; further, as the owners personally guaranteed the LLC's debt to the corporation, the members were only liable if the LLC was liable.

<p class="p4"><b>Parent signed as agent for adult son, not in personal capacity.</b> - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a medical center and denying it to a patient's parent because the parent signed the form on behalf of the adult son as an agent, not in a personal capacity; thus, the parent was not personally liable for any unpaid medical bills. Winterboer v. Floyd Healthcare Mgmt., 334 Ga. App. 97, 778 S.E.2d 354 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Disability insurance policy.</b> - An insurer's interpretation that an employee was not totally disabled for purposes of a disability policy if the employee had only an inability to perform some material duties was correct; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-2-3 and 13-2-2(4), in determining the parties' intent from the whole contract, the use of "total" and "totally" showed the intent to define a state of whole, rather than partial, disability. However, a worker's condition did not merely preclude the worker from doing as much in a day; there were duties of the occupation that the worker could not perform, and, although the worker could perform some light duties after the injury, whether the worker was wholly disabled from performing the "material" duties of the occupation within 180 days of the injury was a jury question such that summary judgment was error.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of surety contract.</b> - Surety prevailed regarding a five year warranty on the roofs of certain newly constructed buildings because the plain language of the bond stated that the bond covered the roofs only for the five years after an architect issued a final certificate, and the architect had refused to issue a final certificate since the work had not been completed.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Knowledge of capacity in which signing promissory note.</b> - In an action following the default of a promissory note, the trial court properly granted the defendant summary judgment because the defendant had signed the promissory note solely in a representative capacity of a limited liability company and was not personally liable and the plaintiff knew that the defendant had not signed in a personal capacity. Envision Printing, LLC v. Evans, 336 Ga. App. 635, 786 S.E.2d 250 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Parties intended to honor arbitration clause in debt agreement.</b> - Trial court erred by denying a client's motion to compel arbitration of the claim against a debt settlement corporation for violations of the debt adjusting statutes, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 18-5-1 et seq., because the arbitration provision in the debt settlement agreement mandated arbitration of all disputes and claims between the parties related to the agreement and the claim that the corporation violated statutes regulating the business of debt adjusting was connected to the debt settlement agreement.

<p class="p4"><b>Contingency fee contract.</b> - Ambiguity in a contingency fee contract, regarding whether the client had to pay for paralegal services upon terminating the law firm's services, could not be resolved by applying the rules of contract construction, and the jury had to resolve the issue of what the ambiguous language meant and what the parties intended.

<p class="p4">Testing service, which required test takers to present valid identification at the time of a test, did not waive the identification requirement by allowing an examinee to take a test without presenting valid identification, as there was no evidence that the service dispensed with the examinee's duty to present acceptable identification for the subsequent tests.

<p class="p4"><b>Court's role in interpreting insurance policy exclusion.</b> - Where an injured patron was struck in the nose by a beer bottle thrown in the insured's bar, the injured patron contended that the insured was liable because the bar and the bar's employees failed to prevent the bottle thrower's attack and the injured patron claimed to have suffered serious injury and disfigurement, but the insurer claimed that the insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify the insured because the incident fell within the policy's assault and battery exclusion; the court held that the portion of the policy addressing assault and battery was not intended to exclude coverage for a bodily injury claim arising out of an assault and battery committed by a patron, as any other interpretation would have rendered certain language in the policy meaningless.

<p class="p4">In an action brought by a lessor against a former lessee, a dry cleaning corporation, for indemnification for remediation expenses incurred in cleaning up the contaminated shopping center property vacated by the lessee, the trial court properly refused to examine a pollution liability exclusion endorsement in a vacuum and, rather, considered that language in concert with other policy language addressing coverage of property damage arising out of the discharge of pollutants and thereby found that an umbrella policy provided coverage for quick, abrupt, and accidental discharges of pollutants. The trial court properly determined that the inconsistent language of the pollution liability exclusion and an amendatory endorsement were ambiguous as the amendatory endorsement narrowed the scope of the pollution liability exclusion by exempting from it discharges that were quick, abrupt, and accidental; but the pollution liability exclusion endorsement broadened the scope of the exclusion by extending the exclusion to any discharge.

<p class="p4"><b>Admission of affidavits to show second life insurance beneficiary designation form void.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to a child in a suit brought by a sibling seeking a determination that the sibling was the sole beneficiary of their parent's life insurance policy as the sibling sufficiently alleged fraud and/or forgery with regard to a second beneficiary designation form allegedly signed by the parent. As such, the trial court should have permitted the sibling to introduce two affidavits that supported the sibling's allegations that the second beneficiary designation form was void. Weatherly v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of parol evidence to prove failure of consideration.</b> - Where in some instances parol evidence that real consideration of contract is different from that actually recited in instrument is admissible for purpose of proving that true consideration has failed, it is never allowable, under guise of inquiring into consideration, to vary or contradict by parol the substance and meaning of written terms of contract itself. Middlebrooks v. Dunlap-Huckabee Auto Co., 44 Ga. App. 543, 162 S.E. 153 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Directed verdict improper where ambiguity remains.</b> - If after the introduction of parol evidence, there remains a conflict in the evidence as to the intent of the parties, this disagreement is an evidentiary, factual matter for resolution by the jury and not a matter of law for determination by the court, and it is error to grant a motion for directed verdict. Karlan, Inc. v. King, 202 Ga. App. 713, 415 S.E.2d 319 (1992), overruled in part by Worthen v. State, 2019 Ga. LEXIS 22 (Ga. 2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Extension of car rental agreement.</b> - Even where a car rental contract specified that the contract could not be changed except by writing, the renter's retention of the car and the fact that both the renter and the renter insurance company paid for the car until the car was damaged in a collision showed the parties intended to and did modify the original contract by extending the contract's term.

<p class="p4"><b>Right of first offer.</b> - A right of first offer (RFO) did not require seller's notice to be sent upon plaintiff executrix's formation of a desire to sell the property at issue for two reasons: (1) a contrary interpretation was contrary to the obvious intent of the parties at the time the parties entered into the sale agreement at issue, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-3; and (2) a contrary construction would have rendered a portion of the contract meaningless, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2(4).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loan documents.</b> - Regardless of whether a note's reference to collecting fees when "legal proceedings are instituted" meant a lawsuit needed to have been filed to obtain fees under the note, a loan agreement signed contemporaneously with the note clearly entitled the lender to attorney fees if the borrowers defaulted on the loan whether or not there was a lawsuit, and, since the borrowers admitted that the borrowers defaulted on the loan, the trial court erred in concluding that the loan documents required the lender to file suit before the lender was entitled to collect attorney fees.

<p class="p4"><b>Employment contract setting out mutual obligations.</b> - When written employment contract states consideration, not by mere recital of something paid or to be paid, but sets forth mutual obligations which constitute terms of contracts, parol evidence is not admissible to show that their true consideration was lifetime employment promise of alleged prior oral agreement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Appointment letter not an employment contract.</b> - In a wrongful termination case, the trial court erred by failing to grant the motion for summary judgment filed by a university's board of regents because the employee was at will based on an interpretation of the appointment letter, which did not provide a definite, specific term of employment and stated that the employment was at the pleasure of the president; thus, the employee's termination was not a breach of contract. Freeman v. Smith, 324 Ga. App. 426, 750 S.E.2d 739 (2013), overruled on other grounds by Franklin v. Pitts, 349 Ga. App. 544, 826 S.E.2d 427 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of parol evidence to identify subject matter of article named in written contract.</b> - When name of article, as used in written contract, is ambiguous and uncertain term which does not of itself disclose character of material, parol evidence is admissible, not to contradict, add to, or vary terms of written contract, but to identify subject matter thereof, and to explain what ambiguous term meant. Porter v. Sterling Prods. Co., 40 Ga. App. 522, 150 S.E. 457 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Contract stipulating whole agreement.</b> - If contract is in fact ambiguous as to some matters, stipulation in contract to effect that the contract expresses whole agreement and that there is no agreement or modification of any kind in connection therewith that is not expressly set forth therein will not prevent explanation in usual manner.

<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of parol evidence of site plan to show nonexistence of use restriction.</b> - In a land use restriction action, a trial court erred by failing to consider a 1997 site plan, which allowed the parties to seek to amend the use of the land at issue and future development of the land; therefore, the trial court erred in enjoining a developer from constructing condominium towers since no such use restriction existed. CPI Phipps, LLC v. 100 Park Ave. Partners, L.P., 288 Ga. App. 614, 654 S.E.2d 690 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0618, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 286 (Ga. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of parol evidence rule as to open price term in option agreement.</b> - Option agreements have generally been held or recognized to be sufficiently definite as to price to justify the agreement's enforcement if either specific price is provided for in agreement or a practical mode is provided by which price can be determined by the court without any new expression by parties themselves; the agreement must be complete within itself as to essential elements or a key or practical mode provided within contract by which definite price may be ascertained, and if there is such deficiency, parol evidence is not admissible to add to, take away from, or vary the written contract, but would be admissible to explain ambiguities.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence is inadmissible to show parties' intentions in lease and debt.</b> - Summary judgment was properly entered for a lessee bank on a lessor developer's counterclaim against it, which alleged that the bank was obligated to pay the entire debt to the bondholder incurred to fund the project, rather than the debt service over the 15-year term of the lease, as the parties knew that the lease term was 15 years and that the term of the note was 20 years, yet failed to specifically provide that the bank pay the debt after the lease expired; parol evidence was inadmissible under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-2(1) to prove the parties' intentions as the lease was unambiguous. Porter Communs. Co. v. SouthTrust Bank, 268 Ga. App. 29, 601 S.E.2d 422 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Both the terms "approximately" and "firm order" in a sales contract were ambiguous</b> in that their indistinctiveness made their meaning uncertain and capable of more than one reasonable definition. These ambiguities rendered it appropriate for the trial court, as trier of fact, to consider parol evidence to determine the meaning of those material terms and thus the true agreement between the parties. Wahnschaff Corp. v. O.E. Clark Paper Box Co., 166 Ga. App. 242, 304 S.E.2d 91 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When promissory note not containing entire agreement, letters by parties containing additional terms admissible.</b> - When promissory note did not express entire contract between parties, but remainder thereof was contained in letters written by the parties in connection with making of note, such letters were admissible in evidence, in suit between maker and one who took note after maturity. Marietta Sav. Bank v. Janes, 66 Ga. 286 (1881).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of parol evidence rule to promissory note.</b> - To the extent plaintiff was relying on conversations "to add to, take from or vary" the terms of the plaintiff's promissory note with defendant bank, the conversations were barred by the parol evidence rule.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence when loan note in writing.</b> - Judgment for amount of note sued on, with interest, was not contrary to law and evidence because lender, at time of making loan and executing note and bill of sale, stated to borrower that, if first installment of loan was not paid, the lender would sell certain shares of stock, conveyed by borrower as collateral to satisfy indebtedness represented by note, as any parol statements and agreements made before or simultaneously with execution of note and bill of sale, which were inconsistent with provisions thereof, were merged into the writing.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Notes and bond for title are parts of same contract,</b> and stipulation in bond for title should have same effect as if contained in notes; only difference is one of position. Construing all documents together, dates of maturity as fixed in notes are necessarily subject to accelerating clause in bond for title. In such a case maker promises to pay on a certain day, and earlier on condition. Gilford v. Green, 33 Ga. App. 1, 125 S.E. 80 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Note and mortgage written on same paper at same time, construed as one contract.</b> - When note and mortgage given to secure it are written upon same paper and executed at same time, they must be construed as constituting but one contract. Smith v. Downing Co., 21 Ga. App. 741, 95 S.E. 19 (1918), and see Read v. Gould, 139 Ga. 499, 77 S.E. 642 (1913); Adams v. Hatfield, 17 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Promissory note for "value received" and imposing no obligation upon payee is facially incomplete agreement.</b> - Ordinary promissory note in which consideration is recited only as "value received," and which contains no provision imposing any obligation upon payee, does not purport to contain all stipulations of contract relative to subject matter for which it is given. When terms and stipulations of such contract rest in parol agreements and understandings between parties, and do not in any way contradict terms of note, they may be established as part of contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence admissible if contract ambiguous as to description, model, and style of time sold.</b> - If contract of sale was ambiguous or completely lacking as to description of model, style, and size of refrigerator intended to be sold, door was open to parties to show by parol evidence just what model, style and size of refrigerator was intended to be conveyed by contract.

<p class="p4"><b>When note not entire agreement, stipulated price not preclusive of proof of other distinct agreements.</b> - When note was not intended as entire contract, but was given in pursuance of contract for sale of described land, agreement in note to pay specified amount was not exclusive of proof of other distinct agreements which parties might have made in relation to land, such as agreement that purchaser was to take up certain papers necessary to acquire good title, and to deduct amount so expended in perfecting title from purchase price of property.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When contract not under seal, parol evidence admissible to establish existence of undisclosed principal.</b> - Since there was nothing in record to show that contract for purchase of car was under seal, testimony of agent that the agent was acting for an undisclosed principal was properly admitted; thus, fact that agency was not disclosed at time of contract would not prevent principal from enforcing contract in the principal's own name. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Coastal Serv., Inc., 103 Ga. App. 133, 118 S.E.2d 710 (1961).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Admissibility of extrinsic evidence to show agency as to integrated contract.</b> - If fact of agency does not appear in integrated contract, agent who appears to be party thereto cannot introduce extrinsic evidence to show that one is not a party, except: (a) for purpose of reforming contract; or (b) to establish that one's name was signed as business name of principal and that it was so agreed by parties.

<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence of oral modification of agreement not admissible.</b> - Because the lease was required by the statute of frauds to be in writing, it could not be modified by an oral agreement, and the trial court did not err in excluding parol evidence of the alleged oral agreements between the parties.

<p class="p4"><b>Liquidated damages as remedy.</b> - Time was of the essence in a contract for the sale of a motel, and the purchaser's failure to assume a loan and to close on the purchase entitled the vendor to retain the purchaser's pre-paid closing costs as liquidated damages, where the contract did not explicitly state that time was of the essence but its terms made that construction reasonable; even if the contract were construed to allow the sale to be closed in a reasonable time, the purchaser's delay of eight months was patently unreasonable.

<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intent of parties is cardinal rule of construction.</b> - All agreements should be determined according to the usual rules for the construction of contracts; the cardinal rule in construing contracts is to ascertain the intention of the parties. Crawford v. Crawford, 158 Ga. App. 187, 279 S.E.2d 486 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After applying the rules of contract construction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-2-2 and 13-2-3, summary judgment to a lessee was proper as it was not required to pay the lessee's portion of security related costs under the terms of the lease, according to the Common Area Costs formula contained therein; hence, it was authorized to refuse to pay those costs without being in breach of the lease agreement. Covington Square Assocs., LLC v. Ingles Mkts., Inc., 283 Ga. App. 307, 641 S.E.2d 266 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When cardinal rule applicable.</b> - "Cardinal rule of construction" becomes applicable only upon determination that contract is ambiguous. Smith v. Freeport Kaolin Co., 687 F. Supp. 1550 (M.D. Ga. 1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Meeting of minds necessary.</b> - A binding contract must be predicated upon a meeting of the minds. Dumas v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 654 F.2d 359 (5th Cir. 1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There was not a meeting of the minds that the purpose of the escrows was to provide a fund against which two defendants could recover on their insurance claims; no valid contract was formed and, accordingly, debtor husband's interest in the escrowed funds was the property of the bankruptcy estate. Also, as to the debtor wife, there was no meeting of the minds regarding the purpose of the escrow, and, accordingly, the wife's interest in the escrow was the property of the estate. Harris v. Nelson (In re Dunn), 436 Bankr. 744 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Statute paramount to almost all other rules of construction.</b> - Fundamental rule, which takes priority over almost all others in construing a contract, is to give the contract that meaning which will best carry into effect intent of parties. Paul v. Paul, 235 Ga. 382, 219 S.E.2d 736 (1975). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Cardinal rule of construction, both at common law and under our code, is, that instruments containing conditions, limitations, and restrictions are to be construed in each case in such way as to carry into effect intent of parties as gathered from instrument as a whole. Emphasis is laid upon fact that technical rules of construction are to be disregarded when obedience to such rules would defeat intention of parties. Wadley Lumber Co. v. Lott, 130 Ga. 135, 60 S.E. 836 (1908). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although there may be special rules of interpretation which would require that pledge contract be construed favorably to pledgor, or to maker of one of notes so pledged, and strictly against pledgee, ultimate and final criterion, as in all cases, is that real object of court should be to ascertain intention of parties; and that where such intention is clear and contravenes no rule of law, and sufficient words are used to arrive at intention, it shall be enforced, irrespective of all technical or arbitrary rules of construction. Deen v. Bank of Hazlehurst, 39 Ga. App. 633, 147 S.E. 909 (1929).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Parties cannot by contract provision prevent construction in accordance with applicable laws.</b> - Parties to a contract cannot by way of provision prevent interpretation of contract by courts in accordance with law applicable thereto. McKie v. McKie, 213 Ga. 582, 100 S.E.2d 580 (1957).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where terms and conditions are left to future negotiations,</b> the requisite meeting of the minds is absent and no contract is formed. Dumas v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 654 F.2d 359 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No agreement where parties contemplate that instrument is incomplete.</b> - To be final an agreement must comprise all the terms which the parties intend to introduce in the agreement. If it is evident from a written instrument that the parties contemplated that it was incomplete, and that a binding agreement would be made subsequently, there is no agreement. Hartrampf v. Citizens &amp; S. Realty Investors, 157 Ga. App. 879, 278 S.E.2d 750 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>If intention is clear and contract contravenes no rule of law, contract will be enforced according to the contract's terms.</b> Budd Land Co. v. K &amp; R Realty Co., 159 Ga. App. 448, 283 S.E.2d 665 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Test of enforceability.</b> - For a contract to be enforceable, the minds of the contracting parties must be in such agreement on the subject matter upon which the contract purports to operate that either party might support an action thereon. Hartrampf v. Citizens &amp; S. Realty Investors, 157 Ga. App. 879, 278 S.E.2d 750 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Section applicable to conveyances of land.</b> - There can be no good reason why provisions of this statute should not apply to conveyances of land. Woodson v. Veal, 60 Ga. 562 (1878).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section applicable to insurance contracts.</b> - A policy of life insurance is a contract. Cardinal rule for construction of which is to ascertain intention of parties. Bullard v.

<p class="p4">Contracts of insurance, like other contracts, are subject to rule of law that intention of parties must be ascertained. American Cas. Co. v. Fisher, 195 Ga. 136, 23 S.E.2d 395 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A contract of insurance is construed to carry out intent of parties. Morris v. Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co., 258 F. Supp. 186 (N.D. Ga. 1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Insurance policies in Georgia are governed by the ordinary rules of construction. Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, 821 F. Supp. 1492 (N.D. Ga. 1993), aff'd, 20 F.3d 1175 (11th Cir. 1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of unambiguous insurance contract is for court, main purpose being ascertaining parties' intent.</b> - An insurance policy is simply a contract, the provisions of which should be construed as any other type of contract, and the construction of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court, with the cardinal rule of construction being to ascertain the intention of the parties. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Davis, 79 Ga. App. 336, 53 S.E.2d 571 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Alimony settlement between spouses subject to usual rules of construction, object being to ascertain intent.</b> - When contract between husband and wife in divorce suit was entered into for purpose of settling question of alimony, the contract's meaning and effect should be determined according to usual rules for construction of contracts, cardinal rule being to ascertain intention of parties. Brown v. Farkas, 195 Ga. 653, 25 S.E.2d 411 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of divorce settlement agreement with periodic alimony.</b> - Summary judgment was properly granted to a former husband in his declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination that his obligation to make "periodic alimony" payments for his former wife's car payments pursuant to the parties' divorce settlement agreement ceased upon the wife's remarriage pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 19-6-5(b), as the settlement agreement was clear and unambiguous in its designation of certain payments as a form of periodic alimony rather than as equitable distribution; contract interpretation principles under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-2-2(4) and 13-2-3 supported that interpretation of the agreement. Crosby v. Lebert, 285 Ga. 297, 676 S.E.2d 192 (2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract, made part of divorce decree, providing for children's education, enforceable.</b> - Contract which is later made part of divorce decree, providing for college education for child or children of divorced couple, would not be illegal but would be given full force and effect. Goodrum v. Fuller, 237 Ga. 833, 229 S.E.2d 639 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Interpretation of language in contract is generally question of law for court</b> unless it is so ambiguous that ambiguity cannot be resolved by ordinary rules of construction. Garner v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 152 Ga. App. 242, 262 S.E.2d 544 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If language is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation,</b> no other construction is permissible. Reuss v. Time Ins. Co., 177 Ga. App. 672, 340 S.E.2d 625 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Disagreement as to intent of parties is an evidentiary, factual matter for resolution by jury</b> and not a matter of law for determination by court. Crestlawn Mem. Park v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract construction not for jury unless intent uncertain after application of rules of construction.</b> - Construction of contract, if needed, being a question of law for court, as well as a duty that rests upon the court, there can be no ambiguity so as to require submission to a jury, unless and until an application of pertinent rules of interpretation leaves it really uncertain which of two or more possible meanings represents true intention of parties. Goff v. Cooper, 110 Ga. App. 339, 138 S.E.2d 449 (1964). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Construction of contract, if needed, being a question of law for court, as well as a duty that rests upon the court, there can be no ambiguity within rules as to admission of parol evidence to explain the contract's meaning unless and until application of pertinent rules of interpretation leaves it really uncertain which of two or more possible meanings represents true intention of parties. Maddox v. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 79 Ga. App. 164, 53 S.E.2d 235 (1949), overruled on other grounds, Etheridge v. Woodmen of World Life Ins. Soc'y, 114 Ga.

If that intention is plain from language of deed, as a whole, and intention contravenes no rule of law, it should be given effect regardless of mere literal repugnancies in different clauses of conveyance. Thurmond v. Thurmond, 88 Ga. 182, 14 S.E. 198 (1891); Keith v. Chastain, 157 Ga. 1, 121 S.E. 233 (1923). See also Gilreath v.

<p class="p4"><b>Intent to be effectuated, although contract affects rights of strangers.</b> - Contracts, even where rights of strangers are affected, will nevertheless be construed so as to effect manifest intention of contracting parties, when such construction contravenes no rule of law.

<p class="p4"><b>Intent to be ascertained and given effect whenever possible, even though instrument unskillfully prepared.</b> - However unskillfully deed may be prepared, it is duty of courts to discover and give effect, if possible, to intent of parties. Skinner v. Bearden, 77 Ga. App. 325, 48 S.E.2d 574 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Mere clerical error not affecting relations of parties is relievable at law.</b> - Any mistake in contract, consisting of some unintentional act or omission, and manifestly a mere clerical error, in no sense changing contract or relations of parties thereto, is relievable at law, and there is no necessity to resort to a court of equity for purpose of reforming contract. Gaulding v. Baker, 9 Ga. App. 578, 71 S.E. 1018 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Parties may provide for alternative forms of payment for realty if sufficiently definite for enforcement.</b> - There is nothing inherently vague or improper in providing for alternative forms of payment in contract to sell realty as long as each alternative is sufficiently definite to be enforced.

<p class="p4"><b>Whether contract is one of suretyship or of guaranty, is governed by intention of parties.</b> Baggs v. Funderburke, 11 Ga. App. 173, 74 S.E. 937 (1912); McKibben v. Fourth Nat'l Bank, 32 Ga. App. 222, 122 S.E. 891 (1924). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Though some of the provisions in a tax sharing agreement entered into by a corporate parent and the corporation's subsidiary in connection with the parent's filing of consolidated federal tax returns were ambiguous, the intention of the parties as discerned by a circuit court of appeals in accord with Georgia law was that the parent was to hold, as agent for the subsidiary, any tax refund which was solely attributable to losses incurred by the subsidiary; because that was the case with this tax refund, it was the property of the subsidiary and thus was not includable in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy estate of the parent. FDIC v. Zucker (In re NetBank, Inc.), 729 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir. 2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Construction of employment contract.</b> - Trial court properly granted the employer's cross-motion for summary judgment, concluding that the court was not required to pay severance to the former employee as a matter of law, as the employment contract plainly and unambiguously distinguished between the non-renewal of the contract at the end of a term and the termination of employment without cause, requiring severance pay only in the latter circumstance. Brazeal v. NewPoint Media Group, LLC, 331 Ga. App. 49, 769 S.E.2d 763 (2015). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the former employee's motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of an employment agreement and properly granted the former employer's motion for summary judgment on that claim because the former employee was not entitled to any future compensation from the former employer after the former employee's termination as the former employee and the former employer entered into an employment agreement with an initial six-month term which was terminable at will. Argo v. G-Tec Servs., 338 Ga. App. 608, 791 S.E.2d 193 (2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly denied the former employee's motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of an employment agreement and properly granted the former employer's motion for summary judgment on that claim because the plain language of the agreement required the former employee to make sales in order to obtain a commission, and the former employee was not entitled to any commission as the former employee had not made any sales during the operative time period of the agreement.

<p class="p4"><b>Indemnification clause.</b> - Based on contractual rules of construction pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-2-3, because a purchase agreement between a retail store and a fan company indicated that the company was not obligated to indemnify the store for the store's negligent conduct, and a later purchase agreement was inapplicable to a prior purchase, the trial court properly granted partial summary judgment to the company and denied summary judgment to the store on the indemnification claim; the company had commenced a voluntary recall of one of the company's products that created a fire hazard, but the store had negligently failed to provide the company with the name of a particular purchaser, which resulted in no recall notice being sent to the purchaser and subsequently, a house fire which was caused by the product resulted in an individual's death.

<p class="p4"><b>Intent of parties to insurance contract determinitive of sense in which terms employed are used.</b> - An insurance policy is a contract of indemnity for loss, and intention of parties, if it can be ascertained, must determine sense in which terms employed are used. This intention of parties must be sought for in accordance with true meaning and spirit in which the agreement was made and expressed in written instrument, and ordinary and legal meaning of words employed must be taken into consideration.

<p class="p4"><b>Insurance policies, each containing escape clauses in event other insurance available, to be read together.</b> - Just as contract must be read as a whole, two or more insurance contracts from different companies applicable to single occurrence, each containing escape clauses in event of other insurance covering same occurrence, or each limited to excess of other policies covering same occurrence must be read together in order to arrive at true interpretation.

<p class="p4"><b>When insurance policies contain escape clauses in event other insurance available, liability of each prorated.</b> - When two or more automobile liability insurance policies afford basic coverage, but each contains a clause attempting to either escape from liability or become merely excess coverage if there is other available insurance, complete and literal intent of each cannot be given effect, but general intent not to be liable for entire loss is achieved by prorating liability as provided by respective policies.

<p class="p4"><b>Insurance policy assault and battery endorsement.</b> - Trial court did not err in finding that, under the policy, the plaintiff's claim for damages for false imprisonment arose out of an assault and battery and were thus subject to the $50,000 sublimit in the assault and battery endorsement because under the clear language of the endorsement, the plaintiff's damages for false imprisonment and false arrest arose out of an alleged assault and battery and the assault and battery were the genesis of the plaintiff's claims for false imprisonment and arrest.

<p class="p4"><b>Right to cancellation.</b> - Since the final item in a contract was that the agreement would continue in effect with the right of either party to cancel by delivering to the other written notice at least 30 days prior to discontinuance of service, the contract contained a right for either party to cancel upon notice.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction of rent increase in lease.</b> - Intention of the parties to a lease was to provide for a rent increase, the amount being dependent on whether the property was rezoned, but nothing in the lease required the lessors to pursue rezoning; the lessee made an election between the two lease options addressing the rent increase when it started to pay rent in accordance with calculations provided for in the lease, and that option provided for a smaller rent increase but gave the lessors the right to terminate with 60 days notice.

<p class="p4"><b>Purchase option in lease.</b> - In resolving a dispute regarding a residential lease with a purchase option, the trial court erred in requiring the tenant to deposit the full purchase price, with no immediate prospect of receiving title and no ability to offer a lender a security interest, because such an action would defeat the express intent of the parties as reflected in the option to purchase.

<p class="p4"><b>Contemporaneous written agreements properly construed together.</b> - In a breach of contract action arising from a guaranty agreement between a guarantor and a retail space owner, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in the owner's favor, as it properly construed contemporaneous written agreements, which were executed on the same date, at the same time, and at the same location, despite a misnomer contained therein, as such did not render the agreement unenforceable. Thus, it was not erroneous for the court to correct an obvious error in the agreement, specifically, the failure to substitute one entity's name for another as the parties intended, and interpret the guaranty accordingly.

<p class="p4"><b>Intent property be used for retail sales.</b> - Trial court correctly ruled that ascertaining the intent of the parties, rather than restricting the use of implications to determine the parties' intent, was of paramount importance as document used by the original property owners to express their intent to build a shopping center clearly expressed their intent and the intent of the subsequent property owners that the shopping center property be used only for retail sales only and that the property could not also be leased for use as office space.

<p class="p4"><b>Divorce settlement agreement.</b> - Trial court properly found that the term "gross income" in the parties' divorce settlement agreement was ambiguous, and, in construing the agreement against the father as the obligor, that the parties intended for child support to be based on Georgia's Child Support Guidelines, and that, by assigning earned income to the father's professional corporation, thereby substantially understating the father's gross income, the father wilfully violated the conditions of the settlement agreement; the father's "gross income" significantly exceeded Form W-2 wages, and the father's computation of child support based only on the father's Form W-2 salary created a child support deficiency.

<p class="p4">Trial court correctly found that as part of an agreement to finally settle all issues between the parties, a wife agreed to waive any interest she may have had in the husband's civil service retirement; the conduct and statements of the parties and their counsel all supported the finding that a reasonable person in the husband's position would believe the wife assented to waive any claims to the retirement.

<p class="p4"><b>Disability insurance policies.</b> - An insurer's interpretation that an employee was not totally disabled for purposes of a disability policy if the employee had only an inability to perform some material duties was correct; under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-2-2(4) and 13-2-3, in determining the parties' intent from the whole contract, the use of "total" and "totally" showed the intent to define a state of whole, rather than partial, disability. However, a worker's condition did not merely preclude the worker from doing as much in a day; there were duties of the occupation that the worker could not perform, and, although the worker could perform some light duties after the injury, whether the worker was wholly disabled from performing the "material" duties of the occupation within 180 days of the injury was a jury question such that summary judgment was error.

<p class="p4"><b>When contract ambiguous, parties may show meaning placed upon contract by parties at execution.</b> - While it is true that unambiguous terms of complete written contract may not be added to, taken from, or varied by parol testimony, and that all negotiations between parties to such contract which either preceded or accompanied contract's execution are merged in the contract, where contract is ambiguous it is permissible for one or both parties to show meaning placed on contract by parties at time of contract's execution, and such construction will control.

<p class="p4"><b>Construction of consent judgment.</b> - Trial court erred in determining that a corporation was not a party to a consent judgment because the consent judgment was ambiguous, and the provision stating that judgment was not entered against the corporation "at this time" since the corporation was in bankruptcy implied that the entry of judgment was contemplated at a later time; the surrounding circumstances showed that the corporation filed a dismissal of the corporation's counterclaim with prejudice contemporaneously with the filing of the consent judgment, thereby manifesting an understanding that the corporation was included in, and obligated by, the consent judgment, and the corporation was listed as a defendant in the style of the case on the face of the consent judgment.

<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment vacated due to existence of genuine issues of fact on construction of contract.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to a bank because genuine issues of fact existed as to the bank's obligations under the loan contract such as whether the bank was not to record the security interests assigned to the bank except in the event of a default by the borrower, whether the bank breached a duty to cooperate with the borrower in foreclosing on the properties securing the underlying loans, and whether a duty on the bank to endeavor to timely review loan requests was meaningless.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Binding contract may consist of several consistent writings.</b> - It is not essential that contract be contained in single document. Binding contracts may consist of several writings - provided there is no conflict between various parts. Cassville-White Assocs. v. Bartow Assocs., 150 Ga. App. 561, 258 S.E.2d 175 (1979); Dibrell Bros. Int'l v. Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro, 38 F.3d 1571 (11th Cir. 1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Multiple documents should comprise signed contemporaneous writings.</b> - Multiple documents may be considered together as a single contract as long as all the necessary terms are contained in signed contemporaneous writings. Board of Regents v. Tyson, 261 Ga. 368, 404 S.E.2d 557 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Hospital records, including a "consent to care" form, did not contain the necessary terms of a contract, since there were no signed contemporaneous writings establishing the essential term of "consideration moving to the contract". Board of Regents v. Tyson, 261 Ga. 368, 404 S.E.2d 557 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consideration and subject matter are separate essentials of contract.</b> - Among essentials of a contract consideration is one thing, while subject matter is another and different thing. McCann v. Glynn Lumber Co., 199 Ga. 669, 34 S.E.2d 839 (1945).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parties' authority to contract.</b> - Upon admitting a parent to a nursing home, an adult child's signature on an arbitration agreement did not bind the parent because the child was not the parent's agent by virtue of being the child and there was no evidence that the parent had authorized the child to act for the parent as required by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 10-6-1. McKean v. GGNSC Atlanta, LLC, 329 Ga. App. 507, 765 S.E.2d 681 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parties' authority to contract for elderly parent.</b> - Motion to enforce an arbitration agreement was properly denied as a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement did not exist because, although the decedent's daughter signed a nursing home admission agreement and an arbitration agreement, the decedent did not personally assent to the arbitration agreement; and the daughter did not have express or implied authority to sign the arbitration agreement on the decedent's behalf as the decedent did not execute any written document expressly authorizing the daughter to act for the decedent, and none of the words or conduct of the decedent could have caused the nursing home to believe that the decedent consented to having the arbitration agreement signed on the decedent's behalf by the daughter. United Health Servs. of Ga., Inc. v. Alexander, 342 Ga. App. 1, 802 S.E.2d 314 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No contractual agreement established with city through statutes or ordinances.</b> - In a suit brought by taxi cab companies, the trial court properly granted the city's motion to dismiss because the taxi cab companies failed to establish that the statutes permitting the issuance of Certificates of Public Necessity and Convenience (CPNC), or the city's ordinances, created a clear and unequivocal intent by the city to create a contractual or franchise agreement that prevented the city allowing personal transportation network companies to operate in the city. Atlanta Metro Leasing, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 353 Ga. App. 785, 839 S.E.2d 278 (2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Generally, intention of parties must relate to something of monetary value in eyes of law.</b> - To constitute a valid contract, intention of parties must refer to legal relations, so that courts may take cognizance of the contract, and it is generally said that the test of this quality of the contract is that intention of parties must relate to something which is of monetary value in eyes of the law. Huckeby v. Smith, 42 Ga. App. 719, 157 S.E. 234 (1931).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One may contract to sell property not owned by oneself,</b> taking one's chances on obtaining title prior to the date of consummation of the sale or responding in damages if one fails to do so. Whether or not the seller could have delivered good title on the closing date is not a question which addresses itself to the validity of the contract. Horn v. Wright, 157 Ga. App. 408, 278 S.E.2d 66 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One seeking enforcement bears burden of proof as to essentials of contract.</b> - Burden to show that there had been contract between itself and defendants as basis of indebtedness is upon plaintiff, and to carry this burden, it is necessary for plaintiff to show, by preponderance of evidence, every necessary essential of a valid contract, which, includes acceptance of policies of insurance by defendants after the defendant had unconditionally assented to all terms of the contracts. Associated Muts., Inc. v. Pope Lumber Co., 200 Ga. 487, 37 S.E.2d 393 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a breach of contract matter, the plaintiff had the burden of proof at trial because under Georgia law, the plaintiff was required to plead and prove all of the essential elements of this claim, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-3-1, including performance and the satisfaction of any conditions precedent. Defendants were not raising an affirmative defense by offering evidence to negate plaintiff's contention that the plaintiff's termination was without cause as termination without cause was a prerequisite to the additional benefit of severance pay under an otherwise valid contract, and the burden of proving that the prerequisite had been met fell squarely on the plaintiff. Jackson v. JHD Dental, LLC,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga. June 14, 2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Creditor was not entitled to compel arbitration of a dispute with a credit card holder because the creditor did not meet the creditor's burden of proving that an arbitration agreement existed; there was no competent evidence as to what terms the card holder agreed to when applying over the Internet, nor was there competent evidence that a copy of an agreement with an arbitration clause was ever sent to the card holder. Bazemore v. Jefferson Capital Sys., LLC, 827 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir. 2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Factual issues in dispute as to whether formation of contract occurred.</b> - In a suit between two business partners, the trial court erred by granting partial summary judgment to the defendant because the conflicting affidavits and other evidence, including the emails and slides, raised a question of fact for the jury as to whether the parties entered into an independent and enforceable quid pro quo agreement. Netsoft Assocs., Inc. v. Flairsoft, Ltd., 331 Ga. App. 360, 771 S.E.2d 65 (2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Presumption, as against general demurrer of parties' capacity and assent to terms of contract</b> by parties execution thereof. Martell v. Atlanta Biltmore Hotel Corp., 114 Ga. App. 646, 152 S.E.2d 579 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mental disparity between parties and absence of consideration as grounds for equitable relief.</b> - Great inadequacy of consideration, joined with great disparity of mental ability in contracting a bargain, may justify equity in setting aside a sale or other contract. Under that principle, a deed may be set aside in equity, on proof of two elements stated, without proof of anything else as to fraud. A fortiori, same rule would apply with at least equal force in case of such mental disparity and total absence of consideration. Stow v. Hargrove, 203 Ga. 735, 48 S.E.2d 454 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract between a patient and professional corporation of physicians</b> was formed because the parties were able to contract, payment and medical services to be rendered constituted consideration, and medical treatment was a subject matter upon which the contract could operate. Atakpa v. Perimeter OB-GYN Assocs., P.C., 912 F. Supp. 1566 (N.D. Ga. 1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach of oral contract proven.</b> - Evidence was sufficient to support a jury's verdict finding a breach of contract in a real estate development dispute as there was no requirement for the agreement to be in writing since the agreement did not directly involve the sale or conveyance of an interest in land; plaintiff proved all of the essential elements of the breach of contract claim through plaintiff's testimony and that of another person. Cline v. Lee, 260 Ga. App. 164, 581 S.E.2d 558 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Partial performance as supplying mutuality and consideration.</b> - Even if a contract might not be enforceable on the ground that the contract was without consideration and mutuality, partial performance of the contract supplies the lack of mutuality and renders the contract enforceable. Hill Aircraft &amp; Leasing Corp. v. Planes, Inc., 158 Ga. App. 151, 279 S.E.2d 250 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Elements to create a contract were met.</b> - Promissory note was enforceable against an accountant where the accountant and the other contracting party were able to contract, both signed the document, and the agreement was sufficiently definite for the ascertainment of the agreement's terms and conditions. Specifically, through the agreement, the accountant avoided having to account to a teacher for the apparent disappearance of the teacher's money by not having to provide a full refund and the teacher agreed to forego any claims to the full amount the teacher had given the accountant. Hayes v. Alexander, 264 Ga. App. 815, 592 S.E.2d 465 (2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There was a valid contract between a creditor and a debtor when the debtor signed a check that indicated on both the front and the back that by endorsing the check, the debtor was entering into a credit agreement, which included terms regarding the interest rate, how payments were to be calculated, when payments were to be made, and what constituted a default. Gerben v. Beneficial Ga., Inc., 283 Ga. App. 740, 642 S.E.2d 405 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court properly granted a wife's motion to enforce a prenuptial agreement and entered a judgment of divorce incorporating its terms because the language of the agreement demonstrated the parties reached a complete agreement regarding the disposition of property in the event their marriage ended in divorce, and the inclusion of the provision indicating the parties' belief that the agreement contained ambiguities did not render the agreement an unenforceable agreement to agree. Newman v. Newman, 291 Ga. 635, 732 S.E.2d 77 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred by dismissing the breach of contract claim because the facts alleged in the plaintiff's complaint, if later proven, could demonstrate liability on the part of the co-owner of the Georgia company for failing to share with the plaintiff the revenue paid to the Georgia company by the multinational music publishing company as agreed in the operating agreement, or for failing to share the proceeds of the sale of the Georgia company according to the equity allocation in the operating agreement. Weathers v. Dieniahmar Music, LLC, 337 Ga. App. 816, 788 S.E.2d 852 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to show elements of enforceable contract.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a homeowners' association summary judgment on a resident's breach of contract claim because the resident failed to show the elements of an enforceable contract pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-3-1; any oral contract between the resident and a member of the association depended upon the statements of the member, who was not deposed and did not offer any affidavit, those statements, therefore, were hearsay proving nothing for the purposes of summary judgment. Campbell v. Landings Ass'n, 311 Ga. App. 476, 716 S.E.2d 543 (2011). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In this breach of contract action, the grant of summary judgment to the appellees was affirmed because none of the documents the appellant cited as establishing a contract between the appellant and the appellees did so; the sales pamphlet, although produced by one appellee, did not constitute a contract because at best, it was an invitation to bargain. Uhlig v. Darby Bank &amp; Trust Co.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Feb. 26, 2014)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Documents exchanged between consumer and utility created contract.</b> - Large load electrical consumer's request-for-services form, together with an electric utility company's publicly available rates, rules, and regulations were sufficiently definite to comprise a contract. Further, the exchange of documents and correspondence between the parties demonstrated that the parties intended to be bound and that a contract was formed. Jackson Elec. Mbrshp. Corp. v. Ga. PSC, 294 Ga. App. 253, 668 S.E.2d 867 (2008), cert. denied, No. S09C0356, 2009 Ga. LEXIS 201 (Ga. 2009).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract existence was question of fact for a jury.</b> - Summary judgment was improperly granted to an insurance broker in a contract dispute because there was conflicting testimony regarding the course of dealings between the party relating to whether or not a contract existed under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-3-1 and 13-3-2; the question of fact should have been decided by a jury instead. Terry Hunt Constr., Inc. v. AON Risk Servs., 272 Ga. App. 547, 613 S.E.2d 165 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting an employer summary judgment in an employee's breach of contract action alleging that the employer owed the employee money for services rendered in connection with the sale of the employer's business because the employee presented sufficient evidence that the agreement with the employer was for a definite amount of consideration; the employee presented evidence that could allow a jury to find that the contract's subject matter was established, the parties' consideration was definite, and the parties' mutual assent to all terms was complete. Thompson v. Floyd, 310 Ga. App. 674, 713 S.E.2d 883 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lottery ticket was contract.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying the Georgia Lottery Corporation's motion to dismiss on the grounds that sovereign immunity had been waived after finding that a Georgia lottery ticket was an express written contract because the intention of the parties and the terms of the agreement were expressed in writing on the lottery ticket and the purchase price was consideration for the contract. Ga. Lottery Corp. v. Patel, 349 Ga. App. 529, 826 S.E.2d 385 (2019). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err by finding that a lottery ticket was a written contract sufficient to waive sovereign immunity because by buying a ticket a lottery player accepted the Georgia Lottery Corporation's (GLC) offer of a chance to win a prize under the terms printed on the ticket, and by issuing and selling the ticket the GLC assented to the terms of the contract. A Georgia lottery ticket was an express written contract because the intention of the parties and the terms of the agreement were expressed in writing on the ticket. Ga. Lottery Corp. v. Vasaya, 353 Ga. App. 52, 836 S.E.2d 107 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Receipt for cash bond did not constitute contract.</b> - As a surety did not sign a bond contract, and the receipt the surety received for a cash bond did not set forth any understanding between the parties, nor indicate the terms under which the bond would be subject to forfeiture, the surety did not prove the existence of a written contract with the city. Thus, the surety's breach of contract claim against the city failed. Watts v. City of Dillard, 294 Ga. App. 861, 670 S.E.2d 442 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Documents did not comprise written contract.</b> - A document and blueprints did not create a written contract under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-3-1 and thus the parties' construction agreement was an oral/parol one and the limitations period of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-3-25 applied; the documents could not be read together as the documents did not reference each other and were not contemporaneous, and moreover even if the documents could be read together, the documents did not identify the subject matter of the contract or the specific parties to the contract, and neither was signed, thus failing to reflect the parties' assent. Harris v. Baker, 287 Ga. App. 814, 652 S.E.2d 867 (2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Computer contractor that had an unsigned copy of an agreement and an invoice for services rendered failed to show that the contractor had a signed agreement with a state agency for purposes of the state's waiver of immunity under Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to compensate for role in company.</b> - Trial court erred by dismissing the breach of contract claim because, with respect to the Georgia company itself, the facts alleged could, if proven, support a breach of contract claim based on the fact that the Georgia company, under the control of the co-owner, failed to properly compensate the plaintiff for the plaintiff's role in the company.

McKenna v. Capital Res. Partners, IV, L.P., 286 Ga. App. 828, 650 S.E.2d 580 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 752, 763 (Ga. 2007). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Member's motion for summary judgment on a manager's complaint for breach of a contract for the sale of a car dealership was denied because the member filed no statement of uncontested facts as required by M.D. Ga.

<p class="p4">Subcontractor's motion for summary judgment was denied as to a general contractor's breach of oral contract claim because whether the parties established an oral contract was a factual question that would turn on the credibility of the witnesses, and a court could not say that it was impossible for the general contractor to provide clear and convincing evidence that the parties came to an oral agreement because: (1) the general contractor contended that the parties orally agreed to all the terms and conditions of the arrangement, shook on it, and planned simply to memorialize that agreement in writing; and (2) the subcontractor maintained that its representatives departed from the general contractor's offices that afternoon believing negotiations were ongoing and that both parties believed no contract could have been formed without a signed written agreement.

<p class="p4">Trial court erred in granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claim for breach of contract because the allegations that the defendant demanded and received from the plaintiff an additional $3,850 for license and trophy fees in connection with the purchase of the safari arguably showed the flow of consideration directly from the plaintiff to the defendant for goods and services which the defendant failed to provide creating a third party beneficiary right for the plaintiff.

<p class="p4"><b>Agreement shown.</b> - Parties' verbal expressions and conduct demonstrated an intent to be bound by an oral agreement for the sale of two sports teams and the operating rights to a sports arena because the oral agreement concerned all material terms of the sale, and agreement was reached prior to the seller's announcement that the seller had completed a sale to another entity.

<p class="p4"><b>Agreement not shown.</b> - When a guarantor alleged that a lender promised to provide "100% financing" for a new facility, the guarantor's breach of contract counterclaim failed because the guarantor pointed to no evidence of any consideration for the alleged $900,000 promise, a significant modification of the written contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Genuine issues of fact existed as to terms.</b> - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the defendants on the part of the owner's claim for breach of contract because a letter of agreement that the part owner refused to sign, as well as other documents, detailed the part owner's compensation following each deal; thus, genuine factual issues existed as to whether the contract's subject matter was established, the parties' consideration was definite, and the parties' mutual assent to all terms was complete.

<p class="p4"><b>Parties bound by agreement although subject matter not in existence at time of contracting.</b> - If contract amounts to executory agreement for bona fide sale of property of character such as under circumstances and under law can be legally made subject matter of a sale, and is not merely speculative in character, parties may be bound, although subject matter of sale has no existence at time agreement is entered upon, and seller expects to comply with the contract by subsequently acquiring property thus agreed to be conveyed.

<p class="p4"><b>No binding settlement agreement formed.</b> - Grant of the defendant's motion to enforce a settlement agreement was error because there was no unequivocal acceptance of the settlement offer that the plaintiff made to the defendant's insurer; thus, no binding settlement agreement was formed as the offer specified a particular release that was necessary for effectuating settlement, and there was no acceptance if the responding party did not accept that release.

<p class="p4"><b>General release provision implied from failure to object to oral settlement.</b> - An oral settlement agreement as to damages for injuries suffered in an accident was enforceable with a general release provision where the plaintiff's attorney did not discover the need for inclusion of language to preserve the plaintiff's right to claim under insurance benefits pursuant to the policy insuring the driver of the car in which plaintiff was a passenger until after they orally agreed to settle the case; counsel's assent to inclusion of a general release could be implied from counsel's failure to object when counsel agreed to settle the case.

<p class="p4">Since the defendant's letter showed in clear and unmistakable terms that the defendant was proposing to sell the defendant's shares to the plaintiff at a certain price, neither that letter nor another, subsequent one triggered provisions in the shareholder's agreement which only came into play through the selling shareholder's transmittal of copies of a written offer containing certain required information, and the plaintiff could therefore not force the defendant to part with the defendant's shares at a different price than that set forth in the defendant's offer because plaintiff's responding letter was a counteroffer, rather than an acceptance.

<p class="p4"><b>When offer requires express acceptance, private uncommunicated assent insufficient.</b> - While an offer may contemplate acceptance by doing of an act, when an express acceptance is required by the offer in order to establish a contract, acceptance must be communicated to offerer, and a mere private uncommunicated assent would not effect an agreement. Federal Farm Mtg. Corp. v. Dixon, 185 Ga. 466, 195 S.E. 414 (1938); National Fire Ins. Co. v. Farris, 63 Ga. App. 479, 11 S.E.2d 427 (1940).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Offer, once rejected, loses legal force and cannot thereafter be accepted unless renewed.</b> - Offer, when once rejected, loses its legal force and cannot be accepted thereafter so as to create binding agreement unless the offer is renewed after rejection by original offerer. No revocation of offer is, therefore, necessary to prevent its subsequent acceptance after it has once been rejected. Winder Mfg. Co. v. Pendleton Co., 27 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Continuing offer.</b> - When under the clear and unambiguous terms of letters to a shipper, a carrier offered to ship any goods presented by the shipper at certain prices and on certain terms, this was a continuing offer and became a contract with regard to each separate shipment only when the shipper accepted the offer and engaged the carrier's services.

But mere proposition or offer, based on no consideration, though continuing in character, or though stated to be subject to acceptance until given time, may be withdrawn before actual acceptance or assent thereto by other party.

<p class="p4"><b>Retention of contract without signing contract.</b> - After an attorney drafted a contract personally and delivered the contract, signed by the attorney and a brother, to their mother, who kept the contract with her personal papers, the fact that she did not sign the contract did not negate her assent to the contract's terms.

<p class="p4"><b>Renewal policy delivered to insured without insured's request requires acceptance before contract arises.</b> - Rule as to right of insured to reject renewal policy is that delivery of policy by insurer to insured, upon expiration of policy, without request by insured, is an offer or proposal which must be accepted by insured before contract of insurance is effected.

<p class="p4"><b>When insurance company failed to respond to application for six months, rejection conclusively presumed.</b> - While period constituting reasonable time for acceptance of insurance application may, as a general rule, be a matter for determination by jury, where insurance company appears to have remained silent for approximately six months after receipt of application, presumption that the application was rejected becomes conclusive. Home Ins. Co. v. Swann, 34 Ga. App. 19, 128 S.E. 70 (1924), later appeal, 35 Ga. App. 358, 133 S.E. 280 (1926), later appeal, 36 Ga.

The plaintiffs' settlement offer did not contain a time limitation, or at best it was ambiguous, giving the insurer a reasonable time to respond, yet plaintiffs' counsel revoked the offer 41 days later.

<p class="p4"><b>Condition precedent prevented summary judgment.</b> - Summary judgment was not properly granted in a breach of contract claim because a plain reading of the contract showed that the parties intended that a condition precedent existed, in that the seller should be given an opportunity to find replacement clients before the buyer was entitled to deduct payments due, and the evidence indicated that the buyer never gave the seller the opportunity to do so.

<p class="p4"><b>Minor misrepresenting age and incapable of making restitution, denied infancy defense unless creditor on notice.</b> - Where infant obtains from merchant clothing on credit on faith of false representation of age, and consumes or uses the clothing to injury of creditor, infant, in an action on open account against the creditor, will be estopped from setting up creditor's infancy as a defense. Unless youthful appearance of infant purchaser or other fact or circumstances appear, such as would reasonably tend to cast doubt or suspicion on truthfulness of infant's representation as to infant's majority, it is unnecessary for creditor to make independent investigation thereof.

<p class="p4"><b>Contracts with minors voidable.</b> - Minor's exemption under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-5-3 from contractual liability is a personal privilege which others may not assert as a defense; binding settlement agreement was reached between an insurer and a minor injured party even though: (1) a contract of a minor is voidable under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-3-20(a); (2) judicial approval pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 29-2-16(e) postdated the settlement agreement; and (3) no guardian had been appointed for the minor at the time the agreement was reached.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reasonable time for disaffirmance after majority depends on circumstances, but is less than seven years.</b> - Infant may disaffirm the deed within reasonable time after attaining majority; and if the infant fails to do so, right of avoidance on the ground of infancy will be lost. What is a reasonable time will depend upon facts of each case, but not be longer than seven years after disability is removed. Nathans v. Arkwright, 66 Ga. 179 (1880); McGarrity v.

<p class="p4"><b>Restitution not condition precedent to disaffirmance unless fruits of contract in infant's possession at time.</b> - While an infant should not be allowed to avoid the infant's contract without making restitution of any money or property which the infant has received under the contract, the infant is not required to make restitution as condition precedent to disaffirmance, unless at time of attempted disaffirmance the infant has fruits of contract in the infant's possession.

<p class="p4"><b>Institution of suit by infant for personal injury amounts to disaffirmance of previous settlement.</b> - Contract by which infant receives and accepts money in satisfaction and settlement of claim which infant may have for damages against another for personal injuries is voidable and may be disaffirmed by infant; institution or maintenance by infant of suit against other contracting party to recover damages for injuries sustained amounts to disaffirmance of such contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Ratification may occur although consideration destroyed during minority and no new consideration received.</b> - Even where consideration received by infant has been consumed or destroyed by the infant during infancy, if, after arriving at majority, the infant expressly ratifies contract and promises performance, the infant is bound, although the infant received no new consideration.

<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisites to recovery against infant to contract under O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> </b>13-3-21. - In order to hold an infant upon a contract, not made for necessaries, it must appear, (1) that the infant was practicing profession or trade, or was engaged in business; (2) that the infant had permission of the infant's parent, guardian, or law to pursue that occupation; and (3) that contract was connected with that profession, trade, or business. Burden of proving existence of this condition rests upon party asserting validity of contract. Medders v. Baxley Banking Co., 17 Ga. App. 730, 88 S.E. 407 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Emancipation from parental control does not remove disability to contract.</b> - Emancipation of minor from parental control only gives the minor a right to the minor's own earnings and releases the minor from the minor's parent's control from that time, but it does not remove the minor's disability and clothe the minor with power to contract. Wickham v. Torley, 136 Ga. 594, 71 S.E. 881, 36 L.R.A. (n.s.) 57 (1911).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Receipt of proceeds by infant for labor, insufficient to establish permission of parent.</b> - Fact that infant is receiving proceeds of infant's own labor is not alone sufficient to establish that permission on part of infant's parent has been given to engage in such business. Southern Cotton Oil Co. v. Dukes, 121 Ga. 787, 49 S.E. 788 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section inapplicable to single transaction for sale of land.</b> - Rule which authorizes infant to make binding contract in connection with business in which the infant may be engaged, by permission of infant's parent or guardian, as an adult, is not applicable to single transaction for sale of land. White v. Sikes, 129 Ga. 508, 59 S.E. 228, 121 Am. St. R. 228 (1907).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Contracts of guaranty or suretyship not within scope of any ordinary business.</b> - It would be contrary to spirit of the law that infant should be bound insofar as the infant is merely a surety or guarantor; a contract of guaranty or suretyship is not within scope of any ordinary business.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>After adjudication of insanity and appointment of guardian, such person lacks all contractual capacity.</b> - Under law of this state, after fact of insanity has been established by court of competent jurisdiction in this state and affairs of such person vested in a guardian, power of such person to contract is entirely gone, and such contracts are absolutely void.

<p class="p4"><b>Change of retirement account beneficiary by incompetent person.</b> - Ward for whom a guardian was appointed due to the ward's mental disability was stripped by the probate court of power to contract, but not the power to make a will; thus, the ward's change of beneficiary on an individual retirement account was a contractual rather than a testamentary act.

<p class="p4"><b>Consideration is essence and soul of a contract;</b> without consideration there is no life in the contract; it is as the law says, a nude pact, and no recovery can be had upon that contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Consideration open to inquiry between original parties to show failure, illegality, or lack thereof.</b> - Between original parties, consideration expressed in contract is ordinarily open to inquiry for purpose of showing that contract was in fact executed without consideration and is nudum pactum, or that consideration was originally illegal and contract void, or that consideration has subsequently failed in whole or in part.

Termination of family controversies affords consideration which is sufficient to support contract for such purposes. To render valid such a compromise agreement, it is not essential that matter should be really in doubt; but it is sufficient if parties should consider it so far doubtful as to make it the subject of compromise.

<p class="p4">In the plaintiff's suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because, while the note stated that it was supported by a good and valuable consideration, it then specified that the consideration consisted of the money the plaintiff extended to the defendant for the down payment and repairs; thus, because the note specified a monetary or valuable consideration, the plaintiff could not rely on a good consideration that was founded on natural duty and affection or on a strong moral obligation to provide the plaintiff, the defendant's elderly mother, a residence at the house or repay the plaintiff the money to help the plaintiff buy a house of the plaintiff's own.

<p class="p4"><b>Every executory contract must be supported by valuable or good consideration.</b> - It is the general rule that, in order to be enforceable, every executory contract must be supported by valuable consideration, or, in absence of valuable consideration, by good consideration founded either on love and affection toward one to whom a natural duty exists, or on strong moral obligation supported either by some antecedent legal obligation, though unenforceable, at the time, or by some present equitable duty.

<p class="p4">In the plaintiff's suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because the plaintiff's purported agreement to rescind the plaintiff's request to be named on the deed did not constitute valuable consideration to support the note as the plaintiff testified that it was merely the plaintiff's supposition that the defendant agreed to sign the note instead of naming the plaintiff on the deed; the note specifically purported to establish that the consideration was the money the plaintiff gave the defendant for the down payment and the repairs; and any consideration for the note was limited to the purported monetary consideration recited in the note. Lewis v. Ikner, 349 Ga. App. 21, 825 S.E.2d 443 (2019). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the plaintiff's suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because the plaintiff could not rely on any prior or contemporaneous oral agreement that the down payment money was subject to certain conditions as the transfer of the down payment money was memorialized in the gift letter, which stated that the defendant was under no obligation to repay the plaintiff and that the gift was subject to no terms or conditions; there was no consideration for any subsequent agreement for the defendant to repay the plaintiff; and the termite repairs money could not be deemed valuable consideration as it was past consideration.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Editor's notes.</b> - In light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions decided prior to Ga. L. 1981, p. 876, which changed the definition of consideration, are included in the annotations for this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>It matters not from whom consideration flows or that consideration may flow to third party.</b> Mason v. Blayton, 119 Ga. App. 203, 166 S.E.2d 601 (1969) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consideration of contract need not flow from promisee,</b> but may consist in promise or undertaking of one or more third persons. Steadwell v. Morris, 61 Ga. 97 (1879); Bell v. Sappington, 111 Ga. 391, 36 S.E. 780 (1900); Bing v. Bank of Kingston, 5 Ga. App. 578, 63 S.E. 652 (1909) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract may be supported by adequate consideration although promisor never receives any of the consideration.</b> Fine v. Haas, 120 Ga. App. 524, 171 S.E.2d 372 (1969) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Promisee of note may maintain action although consideration furnished by third party.</b> - When in suit on note it appears that there was consideration to defendant endorser, fact that the consideration was furnished by one other than promisee does not prevent promisee from maintaining suit on such note. Edgar v. Edgar Casket Co., 125 Ga. App. 389, 187 S.E.2d 925 (1972) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Whether admittedly adequate consideration was supplied by promisee or another is irrelevant.</b> - It is no legitimate concern of plaintiff whether consideration, which admittedly was adequate and has been paid, was supplied by grantee at considerable cost to grantee or was donated to grantee by a friend without cost. Inquiry on this point need go no further than to disclose that grantee obligated itself to supply consideration which was valuable and adequate, and that grantee did in fact discharge that obligation by supplying consideration promised. Archer v. Kelley, 194 Ga. 117, 21 S.E.2d 51 (1942) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consideration supplied by husband supports deed made to wife.</b> - When husband furnishes consideration for deed to be made to himself, but directed that deed be made to his wife, consideration furnished by him would support conveyance to his wife, as if conveyance had been made to him and by him to his wife. Read v. Gould, 139 Ga. 499, 77 S.E. 642 (1913) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transfer of chattel mortgage from mortgagee to mortgagor for consideration from nonparty passes title.</b> - Transfer of chattel mortgage from mortgagee to one of mortgagors, based on valuable consideration flowing from one not party to transaction, passes title to interest of such mortgagee into mortgagor named in transfer. Nolley v. Elliott, 50 Ga. App. 382, 178 S.E. 309 (1935) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Promise made for purpose of benefiting third party, enforceable by latter.</b> - When promise is made for purpose of conferring benefit upon one not party to contract, and not furnishing consideration for the promise, one can bring suit upon the contract. Carruth v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 157 Ga. 608, 122 S.E. 226 (1924) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fact of payment of group insurance premiums by employer, not rendering policy unenforceable by employee.</b> - Fact that plaintiff holder of certificate of group insurance did not pay any premiums on this insurance, but that certificate was issued to plaintiff by plaintiff's employer because of plaintiff's employment, and premiums were paid by plaintiff's employer, and fact that certificate depended upon master policy between his employer and insurer, would not render insurance not binding upon insurer. Liner v. Travelers Ins. Co., 50 Ga. App. 643, 180 S.E. 383 (1935) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Note given by father for relinquishment of disputed claim against son is enforceable.</b> - While promise by father to assume unenforceable obligation against his minor son is unenforceable, and while promissory note cannot be enforced when the note is executed to pay existing debt of another and such assumption is supported by no legal consideration, a note voluntarily given by father in liquidation of disputed, and perhaps valid, claim against his son, is not without consideration where promisee relinquishes his bona fide claim against son, and surrenders evidence thereof. Gibson v. Kyle, 46 Ga. App. 295, 167 S.E. 547 (1932) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When contract benefits public, member of public injured by contracting party's negligence may sue directly.</b> - Contract between state highway department and construction company by which latter undertakes to provide for safety of public during construction of project inures to benefit of public, and member of public injured as a result of negligence in failing to do so may sue contracting party directly. Lee v. Petty, 133 Ga. App. 201, 210 S.E.2d 383 (1974) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Remote grantee of mortgaged property agreeing to pay debt incurs personal liability to mortgagee.</b> - Remote grantee of mortgaged property, who takes by deed in which one agrees to pay a debt, is personally liable to mortgagee where intermediate grantor took only subject to the debt and was not personally liable for the debt. Somers v. Avant, 244 Ga. 460, 261 S.E.2d 334 (1979) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Promise of one to pay another's debts not authorization to latter's creditors to enforce.</b> - When one, for valuable consideration, agrees with another to pay latter's debts, this alone does not authorize creditor of promisee to bring action at law against promisor to recover debt. Sheppard v. Bridges, 137 Ga. 615, 74 S.E. 245 (1912) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When promisor merely assumes to pay another's debt to third person, latter cannot enforce.</b> - When third person is not named as promisee, and where no trust is created in that person's favor, but another promisor, merely assumes to pay debt of another to such third person, latter cannot maintain action thereon. Hawkins v. Central of Ga. Ry., 119 Ga. 159, 46 S.E. 82 (1903) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Wife of promisee, merely beneficiary and utter stranger to contract, could not maintain suit</b> in one's own name. Waxelbaum v. Waxelbaum, 54 Ga. App. 823, 189 S.E. 283 (1936) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876). But see <span class="s1">§</span> 9-2-20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Compromise on conflicting claims.</b> - If parties have conflicting claims, depending upon a law point, and the parties compromise those claims, each is bound by the settlement, whether the law point turns out to have been in one party's favor or not. Capitol Materials, Inc. v. Kellogg &amp; Kimsey, Inc., 242 Ga. App. 584, 530 S.E.2d 488 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consideration other than money.</b> - Order of the trial court dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice was reversed because the plaintiff's allegations that the plaintiff agreed to oversee the renovation and rehabilitation of certain real property in which the defendant had an interest in exchange for the defendant's promise to reimburse for certain budgeted expenditures were sufficient allegations to at least state a claim for breach of an oral contract and consideration could be something other than money. Campbell v. Ailion, 338 Ga. App. 382, 790 S.E.2d 68 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Injured party generally cannot sue tort-feasor's insurer directly due to lack of privity.</b> - Absent policy provisions to contrary, one who suffers injury is not in privity of contract with insurer under liability insurance policy and cannot reach proceeds of policy for payment of one's claim by action directly against insurer. Lee v. Petty, 133 Ga. App. 201, 210 S.E.2d 383 (1974) (decided prior to the passage of Ga. L. 1981, p. 876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Mutual promises must be capable of enforcement against parties making promises.</b> - Where mutual promises are relied upon as consideration to support contract, obligations of contract must be mutually binding upon respective parties; and if one assumes under such agreement to do special act beneficial to another, and that other under terms of contract is under no obligation to perform any act of corresponding advantage to former, agreement is without such consideration as will support promise of party assuming to perform.

<p class="p4"><b>If part of consideration of contract is illegal, contract is void.</b> Hanley v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Ga. 585, 68 S.E.2d 581 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">An attorney was prohibited from enforcing a client's single promise to pay the attorney a lump-sum fee in the amount of ten percent of the sale price of the client's property, after a part of the consideration for the client's promise was illegal because the attorney was not a licensed real estate broker. Starr v. Robinson, 181 Ga. App. 9, 351 S.E.2d 238 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Reason that consideration, illegal in part, voids entire contract.</b> - If part of consideration of contract be illegal, contract is void, reason being that every part of consideration is to be presumed to have had some effect in inducing party recipient of consideration to enter into contract. Brown v. Baer, 79 Ga. 347, 5 S.E. 72 (1887).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Word "illegal" applies to contracts forbidden by public policy.</b> Hanley v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Ga. 585, 68 S.E.2d 581 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illegal consideration is act or forbearance, contrary to law or public policy,</b> or promise to such effect. Hanley v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Ga. 585, 68 S.E.2d 581 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Consideration involving action opposed to public policy is illegal and absolutely void.</b> - If agreement binds either or both parties to do, or if consideration is to do, something opposed to public policy of state or nation it is illegal and absolutely void, however solemnly made. Hanley v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Ga. 585, 68 S.E.2d 581 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illegal consideration is void, but consideration may be void, though not illegal.</b> - A contract may have no consideration for part of promise, and one that has totally failed. In such cases, if it be possible to sever that part of contract founded on this void or defective consideration from good part, it may be done, and good part will stand. But if consideration for any part of it be illegal, whole contract is void. Illegality corrupts and vitiates whole, and courts will have nothing to do with it. Chandler v. Johnson, 39 Ga. 85 (1869).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts will not aid either party to contract founded upon illegal or immoral consideration.</b> - Neither a court of law nor a court of equity will lend the court's aid to either party to a contract founded upon an illegal or immoral consideration. If the contract is executed, it will be left to stand. If it be executory, neither party can enforce the contract. Carter v. Butler, 71 Ga. App. 492, 31 S.E.2d 210 (1944), rev'd on other grounds, 198 Ga. 754, 32 S.E.2d 808 (1945). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Lower courts properly found that a poultry grower could not maintain claims for fraud and misrepresentation against a poultry integrator in connection with an oral contract because the contract was not enforceable in that the grower's consideration for the contract involved the illegal act of false swearing. Blockum v. Fieldale Farms Corp., 275 Ga. 798, 573 S.E.2d 36 (2002).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>"Adulterous and/or fornicatious relationship as consideration."</b> - Because fornication and adultery are illegal, the trial court did not err in precluding the defendant from claiming that the consideration for the alleged contract with the decedent was an "adulterous and/or fornicatious relationship;" however, defendant should have had the right to present evidence of the relationship with the decedent in order to support defendant's contention that no contract existed between them that required defendant to pay for decedent's services because the services were provided gratuitously. Broughton v. Johnson, 247 Ga. App. 819, 545 S.E.2d 370 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illegality is defense to executory contract but cannot support action to recover back money paid.</b> - If contract is illegal as against public policy, the contract's invalidity is a defense while the contract remains unexecuted. If illegal contract is in part performed, and money has been paid in pursuance of the contract, no action will lie to recover money. Hanley v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Ga. 585, 68 S.E.2d 581 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract based on legal consideration which contains legal and illegal promises, valid as to former.</b> - When agreement consists of single promise, based on single consideration, if either is illegal, the whole contract is void. But when agreement is founded on legal consideration containing a promise to do several things or to refrain from doing several things, and only some of the promises are illegal, those promises which are not illegal will be held to be valid. Roberts v. H. C. Whitmer Co., 46 Ga. App. 839, 169 S.E. 385 (1933). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a contract is otherwise based on sufficient legal consideration and also contains multiple promises which are divisible in containing a lawful agreement, coupled with a separable unlawful promise, any unenforceability of the latter will not affect the validity of the former agreement. Starr v. Robinson, 181 Ga. App. 9, 351 S.E.2d 238 (1986); Circle Appliance Leasing, Inc. v. Appliance Whse., Inc., 206 Ga. App. 405, 425 S.E.2d 339 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">The trial court properly granted summary judgment to a payee under the terms of a settlement agreement to recover funds owed for a preexisting debt, despite the fact that a confidentiality provision contained therein was void for public policy reasons, as the consideration supporting the payment provision was separate and apart from the confidentiality provision.

<p class="p4"><b>Adequacy or inadequacy is subject to be considered by parties at time parties make contract.</b> There is no law regulating amount of consideration necessary to support a particular promise. If parties have capacity to contract, and there is no fraud or misplaced confidence, and there is any valuable consideration, courts will enforce contract according to contract's terms.

<p class="p4"><b>Inadequacy of price, combined with circumstances of suspicious nature, may void contract.</b> - Inadequacy of price, as a general proposition, will not, per se, be sufficient ground to set aside conveyance in court of equity; yet, that circumstance, taken in connection with others of suspicious nature, may afford such vehement presumption of fraud, as will authorize court to set contract aside.

<p class="p4"><b>When inadequacy of consideration shocks moral sense, other circumstances seized upon to void agreement.</b> - Inadequacy of price not sufficient per se to set aside sale, unless so gross as, when combined with other circumstances, to amount to fraud; but if it be great, it is of itself a strong circumstance to evidence fraud; and this is true where it is attended by any other fact showing transaction to be unfair or unjust, or against good conscience.

However, these principles of law are not controlling if, as in instant case, issues involved affect creditor attacking deed executed by the debtor to third person, on ground of fraud.

<p class="p10">If a written contract is altered intentionally and in a material part thereof by a person claiming a benefit under it with intent to defraud the other party, the alteration voids the whole contract, at the option of the other party. If the alteration is unintentional or by mistake or in an immaterial matter or not with intent to defraud and if the contract as originally executed can be discovered and is still capable of execution, it shall be enforced by the court. If the alteration is made by a stranger and not at the instance or by collusion of a party or privy and if the original words can be restored, the contract shall be enforced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section applies to written, executed agreement which before agreement's alteration was effective,</b> but does not apply to paper which never became a contract because it was never delivered. Anderson Banking Co. v. Chandler, 151 Ga. 408, 107 S.E. 60 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Alteration by authorized agent voids contract at option of other party.</b> - If alteration was made by person claiming benefit under contract, or by the person's agent authorized to represent the person in transaction, such alteration voids whole contract at option of other party. Shaw v. Probasco, 139 Ga. 481, 77 S.E. 577 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If material alteration is made by stranger, that alteration will not vitiate contract.</b> Probasco v. Shaw, 144 Ga. 416, 87 S.E. 466 (1915).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Addition of language to a guaranty agreement,</b> to the effect that upon the death of either of the guarantors, the guarantors' heirs or estates would not be responsible for subsequent sales to the principal, added at the guarantors' request and obviously intended for guarantors' their benefit, did not constitute an attempt to defraud them, thus voiding the agreement. Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Mason, 171 Ga. App. 685, 320 S.E.2d 838 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Repudiation of contract due to alteration must be in toto.</b> - Offending party, in action at law against maker, is not entitled to recover anything upon instrument, where defendant sets up alteration as defense. But rescission of contract by injured party must be in toto; one cannot affirm contract in part and repudiate the contract in part. Thompson v. Growers' Fin. Corp., 49 Ga. App. 119, 174 S.E. 192 (1934). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To avail oneself of right to treat note as void because of alterations, maker must elect to rescind whole contract of which note forms a part. One cannot enforce for one's benefit a portion of that contract, and repudiate another portion of the contract. Glover v. Green, 96 Ga. 126, 22 S.E. 664 (1895); Shaw v. Probasco, 139 Ga. 481, 77 S.E. 577 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Although restitution not required of injured party upon rescission, affirmative relief on rescinded contract denied.</b> - While defendant may, at least in action at law upon instrument, raise defense of fraudulent alteration to defeat action, without offering to restore consideration or benefits which defendant has received, defendant is not entitled, in such action at law, to obtain affirmative relief upon rescinded contract, or to restore defendant's own status quo without regard to status quo of plaintiff.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Elements essential to void instrument.</b> - Before alteration in written instrument will vitiate whole instrument, three things must appear: Alteration must be material, must have been made by one claiming benefit under it, and must have been made with intent to defraud. Unless all three of these things appear, contract as originally executed will be enforced, if it can be discovered and is still capable of execution. Lowry v. McLain, 75 Ga. 372 (1885); Hotel Lanier Co. v. Johnson, 103 Ga. 604, 30 S.E. 558 (1898); Burch v. Pope, 114 Ga. 334, 40 S.E. 227 (1901); Morgan v. Nashville Grain Co., 12 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Intentional alteration of contract.</b> - Beneficiary's intentional alteration of contract and fraud claims under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-1 failed because there was insufficient evidence to support either claim in that there was no evidence that the insured actually answered "yes" to a question as to whether the insured had been convicted of driving under the influence and there was no evidence that the insurer's agent intentionally altered the application that the insured had responded "no" instead of "yes." Dracz v. Am. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 427 F. Supp. 2d 1165 (M.D. Ga. 2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Allegation of material alteration with intent to defraud required.</b> - Where, in suit by obligee in bond against principal and surety therein, principal denied liability, and surety contended that there had been change in terms of bond after the surety had signed the bond, which was made without the surety's knowledge or consent, and that the surety was therefore discharged from liability thereunder, and, where there was no contention by either principal or surety that there was material intentional alteration in bond, made by obligee with intent to defraud the principal or surety, it was error for court to charge jury the provisions of this statute. Smith v. Georgia Battery Co., 46 Ga. App. 840, 169 S.E. 381 (1933) (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Change of amount payable to larger sum ordinarily per se material, fraudulent alteration.</b> - To change promise to pay, from one amount to larger sum, without maker's consent, is ordinarily to be considered, per se, as materially and fraudulently altering instrument. Howard Piano Co. v. Glover, 7 Ga. App. 548, 67 S.E. 277 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Insertion of interest rate and name of bank as place of payment is material alteration.</b> International Harvester Co. v. Davis, 13 Ga. App. 1, 78 S.E. 770 (1913). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Alteration in promissory note after the note's execution, so as to make the note bear more than statutory rate, is material alteration. Shaw v. Probasco, 139 Ga. 481, 77 S.E. 577 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Materially altered deed.</b> - Deed was materially altered when an attachment containing the description of one of two parcels of property was removed, the deed was ineligible for recordation, and the buyer's failure to object to the recording of the altered deed did not support a finding that the buyer accepted the altered deed without objection as: (1) the seller did not re-sign the deed and the deed was not re-attested; (2) the buyer was not sent the altered deed or land description; (3) there was no evidence that the buyer consented to the alteration or that the buyer otherwise agreed to accept only one parcel of land; (4) the delivery of the altered deed to the bank's attorney was not constructive delivery to the buyer as the attorney represented the bank and the buyer had not authorized the attorney to accept and retain the recorded deed on the buyer's behalf; and (5) the buyer never received a copy of the altered deed or land description before or after the deed was recorded. Z &amp; Y Corp. v. Indore C. Stores, Inc., 282 Ga. App. 163, 638 S.E.2d 760 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Removing provision giving purchaser six-month trial period voids contract.</b> - Expunging from instrument of agreement whereby purchaser was given six months to test commodity purchased, with option of return if not satisfactory, would void contract.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guaranty not void.</b> - Meaning of a guaranty was not changed by a handwritten entry and, therefore, the agreement was not void because the guaranty was already limited by a specified term; the guarantor did not show that the change materially altered the agreement.

<p class="p4"><b>Elements essential to void instrument.</b> - For alteration to void instrument three things must appear: alteration must be material; alteration must have been made by one claiming benefit under the instrument; and the alteration must have been made with intent to defraud.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General Consideration</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Scope of section.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-4 merely sets forth a plain statutory consequence of the receipt or payment of money under a departure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It does not purport to supplant the other legal circumstances that will effect a novation or modification. Turem v. Sinowski &amp; Jones, 195 Ga. App. 829, 395 S.E.2d 60 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Applicability to workers' compensation.</b> - Law of mutual departure, as applied to insurance policies, applies in the context of workers' compensation insurance. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Adkins, 200 Ga. App. 278, 407 S.E.2d 775 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Applicability to loan or lease.</b> - Nothing in the language of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-4 limits the statute's applicability to payments made under a loan or lease agreement. Snyder v. Time Warner, Inc., 179 F. Supp. 2d 1374 (N.D. Ga. 2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Under certain circumstances there may be mutual disregard of executory contract between parties.</b> Southern Feed Stores v. Sanders, 193 Ga. 884, 20 S.E.2d 413 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>To effectuate new agreement, departure from original terms must be mutual.</b> - Although failure to require strict compliance with the terms of a contract may create quasi new agreement, to effectuate such a new agreement, the departure from the terms of the original agreement must be mutual. Crowley v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 168 Ga. App. 162, 308 S.E.2d 417 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a county contracted with a landfill construction company to relocate parts of a landfill, and the contract provided for a certain method of compensating the company, and when the county orally agreed to make interim payments to the company using a different method, with the final payment to be adjusted according to the payment method specified in the contract, the company was not entitled to summary judgment in the company's breach of contract suit against the county for not using a method other than that stated in the contract to determine the company's compensation, because there was no evidence that the parties mutually agreed to depart from this contract provision so as to require notice, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-4, that one party insisted on strict compliance with the original contract terms. Handex of Fla., Inc. v. Chatham County, 268 Ga. App. 285, 602 S.E.2d 660 (2004), overruled on other grounds by Georgia Department of Labor v. RTT Associates, Inc., 2016 Ga. LEXIS 392 (Ga. 2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Court found no error in the district court's finding that the company's mutual departure defense failed as a matter of law. Although the company may have unilaterally interpreted the bank's previous renewals and/or modifications of the notes to have been waivers of the specified dates of maturity, there was no evidence that the bank ever intended them to be so. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. v. Lichty Bros. Constr., Inc.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Aug. 30, 2012)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Waiver by course of conduct.</b> - Waiver results from relinquishment of known right, and where, by course of conduct, one leads another to believe that one will not insist upon strict terms of contract, one will not be heard to complain because other contracting party relies upon one's acquiescence as evidenced by course of conduct in similar situations. Southern Life Ins. Co. v. Citizens Bank, 91 Ga. App. 534, 86 S.E.2d 370 (1955). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">As a general rule, a party to a contract may not waive stipulations in favor of the other party, or rights to which the other party is entitled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, such provisions may be waived by the conduct of both parties intended to result in the mutual disregard of, or mutual departure from the contract terms. Cho v. South Atlanta Assocs., 200 Ga. App. 737, 409 S.E.2d 674, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 895, 409 S.E.2d 674 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A contract provision may be waived by the conduct of both parties intended to result in the mutual disregard of, or mutual departure from, the contract terms. Hughes v. Great S. Midway, Inc., 265 Ga. 94, 454 S.E.2d 130 (1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">There was no evidence that the parties to a security deed agreed to depart from the deed's terms so as to require notice prior to foreclosure of the lender's intent to rely on the terms of the security deed; the security deed expressly provided that the lender could accept insufficient payments without waiving the lender's rights. Chadwick v. Bank of Am., N.A.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. July 8, 2015)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Through course of dealing, entirely new verbal contract may be substituted for valid written contract,</b> and mutual acquiescence in such course of dealing may constitute sufficient consideration for new contract. Long Tobacco Harvesting Co. v. Brannen, 98 Ga. App. 142, 105 S.E.2d 390 (1958), later appeal, 99 Ga. App. 541, 109 S.E.2d 90 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Quasi new agreement.</b> - Georgia law labels a departure from the terms of a contract under which money has been paid or received a "quasi new agreement." National Serv. Indus., Inc. v. Vafla Corp., 694 F.2d 246 (11th Cir. 1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While a quasi new agreement may arise where the parties mutually depart from the terms of an executory contract, to support such a departure there must be evidence that money was paid or received under such departure. Gibson v. Gainesville Bank &amp; Trust, 226 Ga. App. 679, 487 S.E.2d 460 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Modification requires circumstances showing mutual intention to treat stipulations as no longer binding</b> and must be such as, in law, to make practically a new agreement. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. Jarrett, 42 F. Supp. 723 (M.D. Ga. 1942), modified, 131 F.2d 674 (5th Cir. 1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While distinct stipulation in contract may be waived by conduct of parties, it must appear that it was intention of parties to treat such stipulations as no longer binding. Mere fact that one party so intended would not bring about this result. It must appear that there was mutual intention. Southern Feed Stores v. Sanders, 193 Ga. 884, 20 S.E.2d 413 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Provision of contract is not changed where only one party elects to treat stipulation as no longer binding unless other party concurs in such change. Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., 230 Ga. 8, 195 S.E.2d 417 (1973). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To create quasi new agreement, parties to original agreement must mutually consent to departure. Crawford v. First Nat'l Bank, 137 Ga. App. 294, 223 S.E.2d 488 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>There must be more than simple breach by a party, there must be mutual departure.</b> Crawford v. First Nat'l Bank, 137 Ga. App. 294, 223 S.E.2d 488 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Though quasi new agreement arises where parties mutually depart from terms of original agreement and pay or receive money under such departure there must be more than simple breach on part of one party; there must be mutual departure. Vaughn &amp; Co. v. Saul, 143 Ga. App. 74, 237 S.E.2d 622 (1977); Fair v. General Fin. Corp., 147 Ga. App. 706, 250 S.E.2d 9 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When only one party disregards terms, other party may rely on exact contract terms.</b> - If only one party disregards terms of contract and other party did not concur in such changes, then nonconcurring party may rely on exact terms of contract. Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., 230 Ga. 8, 195 S.E.2d 417 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mutual departure from some terms does not affect other executory terms.</b> - Mutual departure from terms of executory contract requires notice of intention to return to original terms before those terms can be enforced. But such mutual departure affects only particular terms impliedly excused, and other executory terms remain enforceable, absent such mutual departure as to those terms also. State Mut. Ins. Co. v. Strickland, 218 Ga. 94, 126 S.E.2d 683 (1962). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A mutual departure from one contract term does not affect the enforceability of the other contractual provisions. Southwest Plaster &amp; Drywall Co. v. R.S. Armstrong &amp; Bros. Co., 166 Ga. App. 373, 304 S.E.2d 500 (1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even if an oral agreement to vary the payment amounts and duration was a mutual departure from the original contract terms of a student loan agreement, the remaining provisions of the original contract remained in full force. United States v. Salzillo, 694 F. Supp. 1560 (N.D. Ga. 1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between departure and novation or abrogation.</b> - Departure differs from novation or abrogation of contract, in that, under novation or abrogation, there can be no return to original terms of contract. American Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. National Cylinder Gas Co., 105 Ga. App. 458, 125 S.E.2d 106 (1962).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>For section to apply, circumstances must be such as to imply mutual new agreement</b> whereby new, distinct and definite terms are supplied in lieu of those provided in original contract. Ball v. Foundation Co., 25 Ga. App. 126, 103 S.E. 422 (1920); Jones v. Lawman, 56 Ga. App. 764, 194 S.E. 416 (1937); Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. Jarrett, 42 F. Supp. 723 (M.D. Ga. 1942), modified, 131 F.2d 674 (5th Cir. 1942); Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., 230 Ga. 8, 195 S.E.2d 417 (1973); Vaughn &amp; Co. v. Saul, 143 Ga. App. 74, 237 S.E.2d 622 (1977); Fair v. General Fin. Corp., 147 Ga. App. 706, 250 S.E.2d 9 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it is true that where parties, in course of performance of contract, depart from the contract's terms and pay or receive money under such departure, modification by way of quasi new agreement will be implied, in order for this rule to have application, it is necessary that circumstances be such as will in law imply a mutual new agreement, so that modification, when taken in connection with original contract, will provide new and distinct agreement complete in its terms. Morrison v. Roberts, 195 Ga. 45, 23 S.E.2d 164 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">For a party to succeed on a claim that the parties had entered a quasi new contract pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-4, it would have to demonstrate that the parties mutually agreed to a new contract with distinct and definite terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, a jury should determine whether a new contract is created. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co. v. Photographic Assistance Corp., 732 F. Supp. 1572 (N.D. Ga. 1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While parties may agree to depart from the terms of a contract, to support such a departure, there must be some evidence that an agreement to do so had been reached. Cloud v. Georgia Cent. Credit Union, 214 Ga. App. 594, 448 S.E.2d 913 (1994); Georgia Color Farms, Inc. v. K.K.L., Ltd. Partnership, 234 Ga. App. 849, 507 S.E.2d 817 (1998).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury question as to whether departure from terms of lease was mutual.</b> - In a landlord/tenant dispute, issues of fact remained as to whether the parties mutually departed from the lease's terms, given evidence that the landlord had agreed to pay for a sprinkler system in the premises, but only if the county would not grant a business license some other way, and the parties did not attempt to resolve the issue with the county. Wright v. IC Enters., 330 Ga. App. 303, 765 S.E.2d 484 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Whether parties' conduct creates quasi new agreement, ordinarily jury question.</b> - Question whether there has been such mutual temporary disregard of terms of contract as contemplated in law presents issue for determination by jury in light of testimony submitted as to statements and conduct of parties with relation to execution of contract. Mauldin v. Gainey, 15 Ga. App. 353, 83 S.E. 276 (1914). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Whether or not there has been mutual disregard of original contract provisions is question for jury or auditor. Southern Feed Stores v. Sanders, 193 Ga. 884, 20 S.E.2d 413 (1942). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Whether or not there has been such mutual disregard of terms of written contract as to create quasi new contract is ordinarily question of fact for jury. Haynie v. Murray, 74 Ga. App. 253, 39 S.E.2d 567 (1946). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Question as to whether or not there has been mutual intention, and in fact mutual departure from terms of original contract, is ordinarily one of fact for determination by jury. Prothro v. Walker, 202 Ga. 71, 42 S.E.2d 114 (1947); Powell v. Mars Oil Co., 214 Ga. 710, 107 S.E.2d 208 (1959); Phoenix Air Conditioning Co. v. Towne House Developers, Inc., 124 Ga. App. 782, 186 S.E.2d 429 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Whether there has been mutual and intended departure so as to make practically new agreement is generally question for jury to determine. Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., 230 Ga. 8, 195 S.E.2d 417 (1973); Travelers Ins. Co. v. Adkins, 200 Ga. App. 278, 407 S.E.2d 775 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Whether conduct of parties causes waiver of contract provisions, and creates quasi new agreement is ordinarily question of fact for jury. Crawford v. First Nat'l Bank, 137 Ga. App. 294, 223 S.E.2d 488 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Generally, alteration or modification of a contract is a jury question, that is, as to whether there has been a mutual departure from terms thereof. Norair Eng'g Corp. v. Porter Trucking Co., 163 Ga. App. 780, 295 S.E.2d 155 (1982). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Immaterial variations.</b> - In contract for inspection of pipeline, plaintiff's purchase orders quoting per foot rate only were not sufficiently and clearly at variance with defendant's offer as to unambiguously evince a clear intention of plaintiff to depart from offer's basis and from custom in trade that per foot rate was based on projected production hours and that extra inspection work for fault in production would earn extra pay.

<p class="p4"><b>Occasional maintenance sufficient to vary lease is jury question.</b> - After lessor admitted that the lessor had performed occasional maintenance and repair on a leased forklift, although it attempted to explain that such conduct was strictly voluntary and done primarily to protect the lessor's investment in the equipment, this performance conflicted with the written lease provision which required lessee to maintain and repair the machine, and it posed a question for the jury as to whether this conduct resulted in a waiver of that provision.

<p class="p4"><b>If a pattern or course of conduct has been established which departs from the express contractual provisions</b> for the payment of premiums on a health insurance policy, and the insurer never gives the insured notice of the insurer's intent to return to and rely upon the exact terms of the policy regarding the payment of premiums, the insurer cannot rely upon the insured's failure to make payment of a premium by the date specified in the policy as the basis for asserting an automatic termination of the policy as a matter of law.

<p class="p4">By reinstating insurance coverage "without interruption" upon receipt of the premium on several previous occasions after the policy had supposedly been cancelled for nonpayment of premium, the insurer may have led the insured to believe the insurer would continue to follow this practice in the future, thereby creating a quasi-new agreement with the insured to that effect. The issue, then, was not whether the insurance was properly cancelled for nonpayment of premium but whether, as a result of a quasi-new agreement created by the past conduct of the parties, the policy was reinstated following such cancellation. Holland v. Allstate Ins. Co., 200 Ga. App. 668, 409 S.E.2d 79 (1991). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">In a civil action arising from a creditor's repossession of a debtor's vehicle, summary judgment on a debtor's conversion and punitive damages claims against a creditor was reversed as the trial court erroneously found that the debtor's failure to demand that the creditor return the subject vehicle was fatal to the claim, given that the creditor wrongfully repossessed and then sold the car subject to the parties' finance agreement, and hence no demand was necessary; moreover, by repeatedly accepting late payments, the creditor could have willingly departed from the terms of the agreement and thus be precluded from enforcing the strict letter of the agreement without first giving reasonable notice to the debtor of the creditor's intent to do so, and there was evidence on which a jury could find that the creditor's failure to give the debtor reasonable notice of the creditor's intent to strictly enforce the payment provisions rendered the repossession and subsequent sale unlawful. Williams v. Nat'l Auto Sales, Inc., 287 Ga. App. 283, 651 S.E.2d 194 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No default had occurred,</b> based on the fact that the payees had established a practice of accepting late payments on a note in the past and had then declared a default without granting "reasonable notice" of the payees' intention to rely on the strict terms of the note, a letter requiring strict compliance never having been received.

<p class="p4"><b>Performance deviating from terms, accepted as mere indulgence, not considered mutual departure.</b> - If one of party to contract, in accepting performance by other party not strictly in accordance with terms of contract, does so merely gratuitously or by way of indulgence, then it cannot be said that acceptance of performance under those circumstances supplies requisite intent on part of party so accepting performance as to render departure mutual. Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., 230 Ga. 8, 195 S.E.2d 417 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>One acceptance of late premium payment not enough to require notice.</b> - For conditional acceptance of overdue premium to amount to waiver, condition must be fulfilled; and one acceptance of a late payment is not enough to require insurer to give notice to insured of intention to rely on exact terms of agreement as provided by law. Sovereign Camp, W.O.W. v. Whitaker, 57 Ga. App. 418, 195 S.E. 584 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere acceptance of two or three late premium payments not waiver of due date provision.</b> - When seller, on more than one occasion and without any express agreement to modify original contract, and without additional consideration moving the seller to do so, accepts from purchaser several partial payments, this would not be such departure from terms of contract as to necessitate notice from vendor to vendee of intention to rely upon exact terms of original contract relating to payments as condition precedent to bringing of suit in trover to recover property.

<p class="p4">Mere acceptance by insurer on two or three occasions of monthly or periodic premium payments after their due date or beyond grace period provided in policy would not, standing alone, constitute waiver of provisions of policy respecting time of payment of premium nor make for parties a new contract in that regard upon which insured would be entitled to rely and insist.

<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of some installments after due date not sufficient deviation to require notice.</b> - Mere fact that defendant paid some installments after the installments were due and in amounts less than stipulated sum, without any subsequent agreement to do so and without any consideration therefor, would not be sufficient to show such departure from original contract as to require notice from plaintiff of intention to comply with strict terms thereof before plaintiff could insist upon forfeiture.

<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of late premium payments.</b> - A life insurer which did not solicit premium payments outside of the grace period, but on two occasions accepted late payments after expiration of grace period, did not by these actions change the original contract agreement which required that payments be made within grace period in order for the policy to be valid.

<p class="p4"><b>No evidence of toleration of failure to make payments.</b> - Payee was entitled to recover the accelerated unpaid balance on a note since there was no evidence that the payee tolerated a previous three-month failure to make any payments on the note such that the payor would be entitled to receive notice before the payee could effect a valid acceleration.

<p class="p4">Mutual departure from the terms of an agreement results in a quasi-new agreement suspending the original terms of the agreement until one party has given the other reasonable notice of the parties' intent to rely on the original terms, and the question whether the parties' mutual conduct caused a waiver and effected a quasi-new agreement ordinarily is a question for the jury.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No mutual departure.</b> - Trial court properly found in favor of a software company and terminated the contract because the testimony before the trial court established that while the software company sometimes accepted late payment, it also complained of the gaming company's untimeliness and insisted on regular payments; thus, under the evidence, the trial judge was authorized to find that the requirements of a mutual disregard of the contract were not present.

<p class="p4"><b>Question of fact as to default.</b> - Since evidence indicated that lessees were in default during many months of the lease and evidence was in dispute as to lessor's notice that it intended to adhere to the strict terms of the lease, a question of fact arose as to the applicability of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-4 and the trial court erred in issuing a directed verdict in lessor's favor.

<p class="p4"><b>Intent to require strict compliance after mutual departure.</b> - Mutual departure by the parties from the terms of a workers' compensation policy required the insurer to give reasonable notice of an intent to require strict compliance since there was some evidence that in handling disputes over the audited amounts of premiums due, the insurer typically cancelled the policy but reinstated the policy once an agreement on the premium was reached and the money paid.

<p class="p4"><b>Section incorporates common-law motion of novation.</b> - Common-law idea of a novation is when A is indebted to B, and B to C, and by mutual agreement B is dropped out, and in consideration of this, A becomes debtor to C. Such agreement constitutes a novation; a new person is introduced to whom obligation is due. Wofford v. Gaines, 53 Ga. 485 (1874).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Four essential requisites of a novation.</b> - In every novation there are four essential requisites: (1) previous valid obligation; (2) agreement of all parties to new contract; (3) extinguishment of old contract; and (4) validity of new one.

<p class="p4"><b>For new note between same parties to displace preexisting one, different consideration or collateral necessary.</b> - In order that the taking of a new note and new lien to secure the note, between the same parties, will operate to discharge or displace the preexisting lien, it is essential that the new lien embrace different property, or that the new lien be based upon a new and distinct consideration.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Note given for existing indebtedness, although at greater interest, not novation unless so agreed.</b> - New notes given for existing indebtedness, although providing for additional interest and, in former case, additional carrying charges, do not operate to extinguish indebtedness on original notes, in absence of express agreement that the notes should so operate.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Novation of debtors.</b> - There may be a novation of debtors, but the novation must be such as to release the original debtor and substitute a new debtor in the original debtor's place. This release and substitution may be by express terms, or may be inferred from the acts of the parties or by necessary implication from a construction of the new agreement. Franchise Enters., Inc. v. Ridgeway, 157 Ga. App. 458, 278 S.E.2d 33 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of substituted performance insufficient to establish novation, absent intention to release original obligor.</b> - Mere acceptance by obligee of performance by assignee, or substituted obligor, is not sufficient to establish novation in absence of words or conduct tending to show intention or agreement on part of obligee to release original obligor and extinguish original obligor's liability. Cowart v. Smith, 78 Ga. App. 194, 50 S.E.2d 863 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Substitution of payor with parties, terms and conditions remaining the same was not a novation.</b> - Change in only one term of original contract which merely substitutes another payor, the parties, terms, and conditions of original contract remaining the same, does not constitute novation. Melton v. Lowe, 117 Ga. App. 783, 161 S.E.2d 912 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assumption of debt by third party not novation absent intention to release first obligor.</b> - Mere assumption of debt by third party is not sufficient to establish novation since it is essential that intention to release first obligor and extinguish the obligor's liability should definitely appear. Otherwise assumption of debt by third party will be presumed to be merely additional security. Cowart v. Smith, 78 Ga. App. 194, 50 S.E.2d 863 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Second agreement controlled over prior agreement.</b> - Agreement entered into in October 2005 for security services controlled a dispute between a security firm and the firm's customers, not an earlier agreement between the security firm and the customers' predecessor in interest, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-5.

<p class="p4"><b>Arbitration agreements.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-5 is not at odds with the general rule that contractual termination does not extinguish an agreement to arbitrate; to the contrary, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-5 codifies the principle that the effect of a novation on an arbitration clause is equivalent to the effect of contractual termination.

<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Law leans against destruction of contracts on ground of uncertainty,</b> and a contract which is originally and inherently too indefinite may later acquire precision and become enforceable by virtue of the subsequent acts, words, or conduct of the parties. Thus, the objection of indefiniteness may be obviated by performance and acceptance of performance. M.W. Buttrill, Inc. v. Air Conditioning Contractors, 158 Ga. App. 122, 279 S.E.2d 296 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Performance as curing lack of mutuality or definiteness.</b> - Even though a contract may be lacking in mutuality or definiteness, on account of the uncertainty, still when that party has entered into performance of the contract, and the other party has accepted as fulfilling the terms of the proposal, the contract becomes mutual, binding, and enforceable. M.W. Buttrill, Inc. v. Air Conditioning Contractors, 158 Ga. App. 122, 279 S.E.2d 296 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tender of performance must be by party bound or someone acting in that party's behalf.</b> Ferguson v. Bank of Dawson, 57 Ga. App. 639, 196 S.E. 195 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Elements of right to recover are breach and resultant damages.</b> - The elements of a right to recover for a breach of contract are the breach and the resultant damages to the party who has the right to complain about the contract being broken. Graham Bros. Constr. Co. v. C.W. Matthews Contracting Co., 159 Ga. App. 546, 284 S.E.2d 282 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contract to bore artesian well may be performed by agent.</b> - Absent stipulation to contrary, one who obligates oneself by written contract to bore artesian well for another is under no obligation to perform any of the labor or to give one's personal attention to work. Council v. Teal, 122 Ga. 61, 49 S.E. 806 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Duty imposed on providers of skilled services.</b> - The law imposes upon building contractors and others performing skilled services the obligation to exercise a reasonable degree of care, skill, and ability, which is generally taken and considered to be such a degree of care and skill as, under similar conditions and like surrounding circumstances, is ordinarily employed by others of the same profession. Kuhlke Constr. Co. v. Mobley, Inc., 159 Ga. App. 777, 285 S.E.2d 236 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability in tort to third party.</b> - The mere failure of a party to a contract to carry out the contract's terms will not give rise to a cause of action ex delicto in favor of a third person who has contracted with the opposite party to such contract, although in breaching the contract the party so failing may be charged with notice that the opposite party will not be able to perform the contract with such third person. First Mtg. Corp. v. Felker, 158 Ga. App. 14, 279 S.E.2d 451 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Liability in tort for breach procured by nonparty.</b> - A person not a party to a contract may, without justification, procure the contract's breach, and be liable therefor in tort.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Good faith implied in unilateral contract.</b> - Where an agreement permits one party to unilaterally determine the extent of the other's required performance, an obligation of good faith in making such a determination may be implied. Kleiner v. First Nat'l Bank, 581 F. Supp. 955 (N.D. Ga. 1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to comply with written notice provision.</b> - After an employee made unauthorized transfers and implicated a temporary bookkeeper in the fraud, the 90-day notice provision in the contract between the employer and a temporary staffing company barred the employer's breach of contract claims because although the employer orally notified the staffing company of the bookkeeper's involvement, the employer's written notice, produced several months too late after it learned of the bookkeeper's fraud, did not constitute substantial compliance with the written notice requirement in the contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Strict compliance required of cancellation provision.</b> - In a lessor's action to enforce the provisions of a commercial lease pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-11, because a lessee's predecessor in interest failed to strictly comply with a cancellation option in the lease, and time was of the essence, the trial court erred in ruling otherwise, resulting in an expiration of the option due to the failure to timely exercise the option; thus, on remand the lessor was entitled to summary judgment on the lessor's possession claim and to the past rent due under the lease for the term sought. Piedmont Ctr. 15, LLC v. Aquent, Inc., 286 Ga. App. 673, 649 S.E.2d 733 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 749 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Booth v. Saffold, 46 Ga. 278 (1872).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refusal of proper tender negates collateral benefits of agreement.</b> - If the debtor makes a proper tender of the full amount due and the tender is refused, the creditor loses any collateral benefits the creditor may have under the agreement and the tender constitutes payment in full. Gaston v. Tate, 169 Ga. App. 298, 312 S.E.2d 372 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Performance or tender excused by other party's repudiation or conduct rendering it useless or impossible.</b> - When contract provides that there must be tender of money or performance of some obligation, party bound to make the tender or perform obligation may be relieved, and tender and obligation held to have been waived, if other party to contract repudiates it, by act or word, or takes position which would render tender or performance of obligation imposed useless or impossible. Rives E. Worrell Co. v. Key Sys., 147 Ga. App. 383, 248 S.E.2d 686 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">To constitute a defense to breach of a lease action the defendant's nonperformance must have been caused by conduct of the plaintiff which made the defendant's performance useless or impossible. Ott v. Vineville Mkt., Ltd., 203 Ga. App. 80, 416 S.E.2d 362 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Since the parties' verbal expressions and conduct demonstrated an intent to be bound by an oral agreement for the sale of two sports teams and the operating rights to a sports arena, the seller's argument that the oral contract failed because the buyer had not obtained required approvals from the respective sports leagues failed because the seller's conduct in executing an agreement with another entity prevented the buyer from obtaining the league approvals.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No evidence to show competition made business impossible or useless.</b> - Although nearby competition seemingly could hamper a business' profitability, defendant's evidence failed to create a credible issue of fact on whether this competition made defendant's business' operation impossible or useless, therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the plaintiff. Ott v. Vineville Mkt., Ltd., 203 Ga. App. 80, 416 S.E.2d 362 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No evidence of excuse.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a general contractor because nothing in the record raised the issue that the general contractor made the subcontractor's performance useless or impossible.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If both parties contributed to the delay</b> in performance, but defendant's breaches were in no way caused by plaintiff's conduct, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-23 did not apply to excuse defendant's breaches. CRS Sirrine, Inc. v. Dravo Corp., 219 Ga. App. 301, 464 S.E.2d 897 (1995).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section permits one to waive breach and sue in quantum meruit for services performed.</b> - Party to contract who has partly performed by rendering valuable services may, if it appears that opposite party has repudiated and abandoned contract, or has prevented former from further performance, waive one's right to recover for breach of contract, and, by treating contract as rescinded, maintain action in quantum meruit against other contracting party for value of services rendered. Weathercraft Co. v. Byrd, 32 Ga. App. 369, 123 S.E. 180 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Improper tender excused when opposite party's conduct waives obligation to tender.</b> - Even when one party does not properly tender materials, the tendering party is relieved of that obligation when other party instructs the tendering party to keep materials where they are. Such conduct by receiving party amounts to waiver of tendering party's contractual obligation to perform. Rives E. Worrell Co. v. Key Sys., 147 Ga. App. 383, 248 S.E.2d 686 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>No recovery of damages where delay in performance proximately caused by both parties.</b> - When each party to contract proximately contributed to delay in performance, law does not provide for recovery or apportionment of damages occasioned thereby to either party. J.A. Jones Constr. Co. v. Greenbriar Shopping Ctr., 332 F. Supp. 1336 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff'd, 461 F.2d 1269 (5th Cir. 1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Subjective interpretation of events and communications prohibited recovery.</b> - Defendant was not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's breach of contract claims based upon O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-23 because the defendant failed to establish as a matter of law that the plaintiff's performance or non-performance under any agreement between the parties was sufficient to excuse the defendant of the defendant's obligations under the agreements because the court could not have determined that one party's conduct, which was based in large part upon subjective interpretations of certain events and communications, was unreasonable as a matter of law. Whitesell Corp. v. Electrolux Home Prods.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(S.D. Ga. June 8, 2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Impossibility not due to act of God nor other party.</b> - When the plaintiff contracts to perform covenants that are impossible, not because of an act of God or the conduct of the defendant, the failure to perform such covenants is as fatal to the plaintiff's right to recover as a breach of the contract for any other reason. J.C. Penney Co. v. Davis &amp; Davis, Inc., 158 Ga. App. 169, 279 S.E.2d 461 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Guarantor estopped after guarantor acknowledged existence of actionable default.</b> - Guarantor's post-default agreements, in which guarantor acknowledged the existence of an actionable default in the payment of notes, estopped the guarantor from subsequently asserting that the initial declaration of the default was "wrongful and meritless." Harrell v. Huntington Assocs., 190 Ga. App. 421, 379 S.E.2d 194 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Demand for performance.</b> - When an employee presented evidence showing performance on the employee's part until the time the employee was allegedly terminated by the employer, it is immaterial whether the employee demanded performance by the employer under an employment contract. Gram Corp. v. Wilkinson, 210 Ga. App. 680, 437 S.E.2d 341 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Offer to perform insufficient tender of performance.</b> - When a seller failed to pay the closing costs under a buy-back provision in its contract with the buyers, the buyers were properly granted a declaratory judgment which held that the seller was responsible to pay the closing costs, and an offer to do so was insufficient to satisfy this duty, and did not satisfy O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-24. Tullis Devs., Inc. v. 3M Constr., Inc., 282 Ga. App. 335, 638 S.E.2d 787 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to meet sales thresholds.</b> - Defendant properly terminated the distributor's agreement because plaintiff failed to meet certain sales thresholds in the agreement. Imps. Serv. Corp. v. GP Chems. Equity, LLC, 652 F. Supp. 2d 1292 (N.D. Ga. 2009), aff'd, 476 Fed. Appx. 717 (11th Cir. Ga. 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lease contracts.</b> - Because evidence was presented that a commercial lessee successfully terminated its lease only because it was forced out of business when the lessor refused to pay for stone it received from the lessee, the trial court properly held that the lessor was required to mitigate its damages. Allen v. Harkness Stone Co., 271 Ga. App. 397, 609 S.E.2d 647 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to exercise option to purchase property.</b> - Trial court erred in granting a flea market operator and a property owner summary judgment in their slander of title action against a real estate investment firm and the estate of the firm's sole member because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the firm was a party to the sales contract entered into between the operator and the member; if the firm and member could establish that they failed to schedule a closing on the subject property because the operator refused to sell (or to allow the owner to sell) the property, then the operator and owner could not rely upon or benefit from such a failure as a means of establishing that the firm and member failed to exercise the option to purchase the property. Shiva Mgmt., LLC v. Walker, 308 Ga. App. 878, 708 S.E.2d 710 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Buyer's right to specific performance.</b> - Trial court erred in granting sellers' motion for summary judgment in a buyer's action seeking specific performance of land purchase agreements because whether the buyer waived the buyer's right to specific performance remained an issue for the trier of fact; although the agreements originally made the buyer's failure to purchase a sewer plant parcel a terminating event, the parties agreed in writing at the first closing that the buyer had performed adequately nonetheless, and under the circumstances, the sellers had no basis for asserting that the buyer's failure either to buy the sewer plant or to specify the parcels in the fifth option purchase stripped the buyer, as a matter of law, of the buyer's right to specific performance. Simprop Acquisition Co. v. L. Simpson Charitable Remainder Unitrust, 305 Ga. App. 564, 699 S.E.2d 860 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nonpayment of mortgage not excused.</b> - Borrower's nonpayment of a mortgage was fatal to the borrower's claim for breach of contract and wrongful foreclosure because the alleged injury was solely attributable to the borrower's own acts or omissions. Payment could be excused only if nonperformance was caused by the conduct of the lender. Rourk v. Bank of Am.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir. Sept. 30, 2014)(Unpublished).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Obligation to act excused.</b> - Obligation of plaintiffs, a debtor, its affiliate, and a subsidiary, to act within a certain time under the terms of a securities purchase agreement was excused, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-23, due to defendant's failure to respond fully to plaintiffs' requests for information because (1) an employee of plaintiffs could not have determined whether plaintiffs agreed or disagreed with defendant's figures in two working capital statements without the information the employee requested from defendant; (2) the evidence did not establish that defendant cooperated with plaintiffs when they requested additional documentation and clarification; and (3) plaintiffs' ability to perform their obligations under the agreement was hampered by defendant's failure to provide necessary documents and answers to plaintiffs' questions about defendant's calculations.

<p class="p10">A tender properly made may be equivalent to performance. The tender must be certain and unconditional, except for a receipt in full or delivery of the obligation, and may be made by an agent and to an agent authorized to receive. The tender must be in full payment of the specific debt, and not in part, and may be made at any time before trial. If tender is rejected on grounds unrelated to informality, informality cannot afterward be raised in objection to the tender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">While the mortgagors sent a notice to the loan servicer offering to tender a payment of the full amount due, no actual money was tendered in the letter, thus, there was no valid tender, so cancellation of the deed was not available under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-24.

<p class="p4"><b>Borrower under deed to secure debt cannot prevent sale under power unless borrower tenders debt.</b> - Borrower who has executed deed to secure debt is not entitled to injunction against sale of property under power in deed unless borrower first pays or tenders to creditor amount admittedly due. Same rule applies where one standing in place of borrower seeks injunction to prevent transferee or assignee of such deed from selling property for purpose of satisfying secured debt. Crockett v. Oliver, 218 Ga. 620, 129 S.E.2d 806 (1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Tender of fine equivalent to payment if made before past due.</b> - Proper tender of a fine would be equivalent to the fine's payment, when such tender is made after time which law allows for paying fine, it does not have effect of payment. Pappas v. Aldredge, 192 Ga. 482, 15 S.E.2d 718 (1941).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How tender on offer to redeem property from taxes should be made.</b> - Tender on offer to redeem property from taxes not only must be made in due time and manner, but be continuous, with continuous offer to pay; and if such continuity is not otherwise shown, at least bringing of money into court on filing of suit is necessary in place of continuous offer by pleading. Durham v. Crawford, 196 Ga. 381, 26 S.E.2d 778 (1943).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Worthless check, where worthlessness unknown to person to whom tendered, cannot constitute valid legal tender</b> of a debt, even though person to whom check is tendered has waived fact that tender is made in form of a check. Manry v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 42 Ga. App. 24, 155 S.E. 43 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tender of check, worthless at time written or any time thereafter, not valid legal tender.</b> - Tender of check drawn upon bank in which drawer had not on deposit, either at that time or at any time afterwards, funds sufficient to pay check, does not constitute valid legal tender. Manry v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 42 Ga. App. 24, 155 S.E. 43 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Check, worthless when tendered, not valid legal tender, although made with intent to cover.</b> - It is immaterial that person tendering worthless check intends to make check good by deposit of sufficient funds in bank before check is presented for payment, and will do so if check is accepted, and that check if accepted will be paid; the check nevertheless is at the time, by reason of insufficiency of funds in bank to cover the check, of no value, and for this reason is not a valid legal tender. Manry v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 42 Ga. App. 24, 155 S.E. 43 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of refusal of proper tender.</b> - When creditor refuses to accept proper tender, claim is not extinguished, nor is debtor harmed by refusal. Debtor still has the debtor's money. The debtor may lend it or use it in business. If, however, the debtor wishes to stop running of interest, or to prevent accrual of costs, the debtor must keep the tender good. But where creditor has collateral, mortgage, or other form of security upon property of debtor, failure to accept legal tender discharges lien which was intended to secure payment. Bourquin v. Bourquin, 120 Ga. 115, 47 S.E. 639 (1904); Ragan v. Newton, 27 Ga. App. 534, 109 S.E. 412 (1921). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When creditor refuses to accept proper tender in payment of debt, refusal does not extinguish debt, but creditor loses collateral benefits under security deed given to secure the debt; however, if proper tender is refused by creditor under claim of right bona fide because of mistake on creditor's part as to creditor's legal rights, refusal does not operate as discharge of security. Lanier v. Mandeville Mills, 183 Ga. 716, 189 S.E. 532 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Refusal of creditor to accept proper tender in payment of debt does not extinguish debt, but creditor loses collateral benefits under deed given to secure debt. Ward v. McGuire, 213 Ga. 563, 100 S.E.2d 276 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Refusal of proper tender discharges lien. Creditor, by refusing to accept, does not forfeit the creditor's right to the thing tendered, but the creditor does lose all collateral benefits or securities. Lanier v. Romm, 131 Ga. App. 531, 206 S.E.2d 588 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Payment of funds into court constituted a valid tender.</b> Bank of Early v. Broun, 156 Ga. App. 445, 274 S.E.2d 802 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Stating funds are in an attorney's escrow account.</b> - Just as providing a copy of a certified check is not the same as producing the actual check, stating that funds are in an attorney's escrow account is not the same as providing actual funds. Because the plaintiffs failed to provide a valid tender, their wrongful foreclosure claim failed. Thakkar v. Bay Point Capital Partners, LP,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Jan. 12, 2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Willingness to pay not sufficent for tender.</b> - When a seller failed to pay the closing costs under a buy-back provision in its contract with the buyers, the buyers were properly granted a declaratory judgment which held that the seller was responsible to pay the closing costs, and an offer to do so was insufficient to satisfy this duty, and did not satisfy O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-24. Tullis Devs., Inc. v. 3M Constr., Inc., 282 Ga. App. 335, 638 S.E.2d 787 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Additional "tender" held unnecessary.</b> - When the trial court ordered specific performance of an obligation to sell land, the owner refused to convey the land when the purchaser offered to pay a sum less than the stated contract price, and the trial court again ordered specific performance, and made further direction concerning payment of the purchase price, no additional "tender," was necessary to preserve the buyer's right to acquire the property.

<p class="p4"><b>Though check is not legal tender, acceptance by creditor waives form of tender.</b> - While strictly speaking a check is not legal tender, if creditor accepts the check and makes no objection to specie of payment, this constitutes waiver of form of tender.

This forms an exception to the well-settled rule that if an agent is given power in general terms to do an act, the agent is restricted in manner of performing it to that which is usual in course of business.

<p class="p4"><b>Basis for right to restoration upon rescission.</b> - The equitable right to restoration upon the rescission of a contract rests upon the doctrine that a party who has received from another anything of value by virtue of a contract cannot rescind the contract without restoring whatever thing of value one has so gotten. Jones v. Gaskins, 248 Ga. 510, 284 S.E.2d 398 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Letter referring to rescission,</b> but plainly indicating that the subject of rescission was under negotiation, was not a rescission of the contract. Southern Prestige Homes, Inc. v. Moscoso, 243 Ga. App. 412, 532 S.E.2d 122 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rescission and restitution are available remedies for material nonperformance or breach in certain situations,</b> but various rules govern situations in which these remedies will be granted. Cutcliffe v. Chesnut, 122 Ga. App. 195, 176 S.E.2d 607 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rescission not mandatory even if parties can be restored to original positions.</b> - Even if parties can be restored to their respective conditions at time of alleged breach, plaintiff is not required to rescind. Western Contracting Corp. v. State Hwy. Dep't, 125 Ga. App. 376, 187 S.E.2d 690 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Option for damages or rescission.</b> - When money is paid on contract which is executory on part of one who receives money, and party so receiving fails to fulfill one's part of the contract, the injured party may elect either to bring action on contract and recover damages for nonperformance, or to consider contract as rescinded and recover money paid. Marietta Publishing Co. v. Times Publishing Co., 26 Ga. App. 752, 107 S.E. 270 (1921); Cutcliffe v. Chesnut, 122 Ga. App. 195, 176 S.E.2d 607 (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Breach must be material.</b> - County's refusal to pay all of the requested amount of a contractor's change order did not constitute a material breach of contract allowing the contractor to terminate the contract, given that the amount of the change order was about two percent of the total contract price. Forsyth County v. Waterscape Servs., LLC, 303 Ga. App. 623, 694 S.E.2d 102 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party who has substantially broken contract cannot rescind on ground of other's nonperformance.</b> - Right to rescind or terminate contract on ground of failure of performance by opposite party belongs only to party who is free from substantial default personally, and a party who has substantially broken contract cannot rescind the contract on ground that other party subsequently refused or failed to perform. Martin v. Rollins, Inc., 138 Ga. App. 649, 226 S.E.2d 771 (1976), aff'd, 238 Ga. 119, 231 S.E.2d 751 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Rescission of a contract was inappropriate under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-62 because the purchasers premised the purchasers' rescission for nonperformance claim upon the failure of a contingency that acted as a condition precedent in a purchase agreement and the failure to satisfy the condition precedent, that the franchisor would agree to the purchaser's obtaining the seller's ice cream store franchise, excused the parties' obligations and performance under the purchase agreement. Yi v. Li, 313 Ga. App. 273, 721 S.E.2d 144 (2011).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of rescission is based upon restitution,</b> and it is only applicable generally where restitution can or ought to be made. This doctrine can have no application to case if one party has acquired nothing which other party is entitled to have restored. Henderson Whse. Co. v. Brand, 105 Ga. 217, 31 S.E. 551 (1898).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When contract is rescinded, parties are not to be left where rescission finds the paraties;</b> original status must be restored, or equivalent therefor must be provided in contract or furnished by law. Eller v. McMillan, 174 Ga. 729, 163 S.E. 910 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Party electing to rescind must restore or tender benefits received under contract.</b> Milam v. Gray, 80 Ga. App. 356, 56 S.E.2d 168 (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restoration to substantially original position is sufficient.</b> - Restoration does not require that the opposite party shall be placed in the exact situation in which the party was before the exchange, but only that the party be placed substantially in the party's original position, and that the party rescinding shall derive no unconscionable advantage from the rescission. Jones v. Gaskins, 248 Ga. 510, 284 S.E.2d 398 (1981); International Software Solutions, Inc. v. Atlanta Pressure Treated Lumber Co., 194 Ga. App. 441, 390 S.E.2d 659 (1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recovery of consideration is available remedy.</b> - The restitutionary remedy of recovery of the consideration advanced on the theory of rescission of the contract because of the material nonperformance or breach is an available remedy in this state. Jones v. Gaskins, 248 Ga. 510, 284 S.E.2d 398 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Return of down payment required when contract for sale of land is rescinded.</b> - Defense judgment was reversed as the seller of a vacant lot continued to hold possession and title to the land and offered the land for sale to another after the buyer defaulted on a contract similar to a bond for title or an installment sale contract; as the seller rescinded the contract, the original status had to be restored and the buyer was entitled to the return of the down payment. Crowell v. Williams, 273 Ga. App. 676, 615 S.E.2d 797 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant may assert right to restoration to original position defensively only.</b> - When vendor is entitled to rescind without consent of opposite party, vendee cannot take advantage of vendee's own wrong so as to give oneself standing as plaintiff in action to recover for improvements or purchase-money paid in part performance of contract of sale. Such claim can only be asserted defensively, when vendor by exercising right of rescission has clothed vendee with correlative right to be restored to vendee's status. Clark v. Powell, 30 Ga. App. 198, 117 S.E. 250 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equitable right to restitution upon rescission not dependent upon full performance of party seeking restitution.</b> - Equitable right to restitution upon rescission of contract does not depend upon full performance of contract by party seeking restitution. This right rests upon doctrine that party who has received from another anything of value by virtue of contract cannot rescind the contract without restoring whatever thing of value one has so gotten. Kerlin v. Young, 159 Ga. 95, 125 S.E. 204 (1924).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Rescission of settlement agreement.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying a temporary staffing agency's motion to enforce and enter judgment on a settlement agreement because, shortly after the agency entered into the settlement agreement with a widow and a decedent's estate, it announced that it would not make the payments it had agreed to make; because the entire purpose of the contract was the exchange of certain sums for a release from liability, the trial court did not err in ruling that the widow and estate had, with authority, rescinded the post-trial settlement agreement.

At the time such an agreement is given, there is no claim in existence to be released. It speaks of future, not of present or past. Since no liability exists, none can be released. Wade v.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between covenant not to sue and release.</b> - Covenant not to sue is different in legal effect from a release, in that where executed to one of two joint tortfeasors it does not release the other, though as to first it leaves the first tortfeasor in as good a position as to ultimate freedom from liability as if that tortfeasor had been expressly released. Atlantic C.L.R.R. v. Ouzts, 82 Ga. App. 36, 60 S.E.2d 770 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Even though O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-81 provides that a covenant not to sue is "equivalent" to a release, the legal effect of a covenant not to sue is distinguished from the legal effect of a release. World Bazaar Franchise Corp. v. CCC Assocs. Co., 167 Bankr. 985 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loan receipt agreement between plaintiff and joint tortfeasor</b> in exchange for a forbearance to sue is an absolute payment and not a loan. As such, the agreement constitutes a covenant not to sue and not a release. American Chain &amp; Cable Co. v. Brunson, 157 Ga. App. 833, 278 S.E.2d 719 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>There is difference between accord and satisfaction or release and covenant not to sue.</b> - There is a decided difference between consequence of accord and satisfaction, or release of one defendant, and that of mere covenant not to sue one defendant. Moore v. Smith, 78 Ga. App. 49, 50 S.E.2d 219 (1948).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Covenant not to sue releases only one with whom it is entered.</b> Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hill, 113 Ga. App. 283, 148 S.E.2d 83 (1966). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-81 provides that a covenant never to sue is equivalent to a release, it applies to the parties with whom the covenant is made and not to another tortfeasor. A covenant not to sue one tortfeasor will not bar actions against another tortfeasor. American Chain &amp; Cable Co. v. Brunson, 157 Ga. App. 833, 278 S.E.2d 719 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>General release bars any cause of action.</b> - When a release is general, i.e., one that releases the alleged tortfeasor from all claims arising out of an occurrence, in the absence of fraud such release will bar any cause of action by the person executing the release. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 519 F. Supp. 60 (S.D. Ga. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Covenant not to sue when multiple tortfeasors.</b> - Written covenant not to sue one of two joint tortfeasors is not, stating that it is equivalent to a release, a release of other joint tortfeasor, and does not bar proceeding against the other tortfeasor. Atlantic C.L.R.R. v. Ouzts, 82 Ga. App. 36, 60 S.E.2d 770 (1950). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Consideration generally required for covenant not to sue to operate as release of preexisting obligation.</b> - If covenant never to sue is relied upon as release of preexisting obligation to pay, such covenant would not be binding unless founded upon sufficient consideration; but this is not true when covenant never to sue comes into existence contemporaneously with obligation to pay.

<p class="p4"><b>Permitting foreclosure not deemed accord and satisfaction.</b> - Assuming as true defendant's assertion that the defendant entered into an agreement with plaintiff to permit foreclosure and sale of the collateral real property to extinguish the defendant's debt, this agreement fell short of an accord and satisfaction, since it was unenforceable for lack of consideration, since an agreement on the part of one to do what one is already legally bound to do is not a sufficient consideration for the promise of another. Consequently, since defendant failed in presenting evidence to establish a prima facie case of novation or accord and satisfaction, and since the amount of the deficiency under the promissory note was undisputed, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff.

<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>All claims and demands, whether liquidated or unliquidated, disputed or undisputed, may furnish subject matter</b> of agreement in accord and satisfaction, provided such agreement, like all other express or implied contracts, is supported by consideration. Matthews v. Sprayberry, 216 Ga. 40, 114 S.E.2d 516 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of less than full amount owed in satisfaction of entire debt.</b> - An accord and satisfaction occurs if a creditor tenders to the debtor a sum of money, though it be less than the amount actually owed, and the tender is made upon the condition, express or implied, that it satisfies the entire debt, and if the creditor accepts the tender. Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Southeastern Ventilating, Inc., 159 Ga. App. 443, 283 S.E.2d 660 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Satisfaction of debt by less than amount claimed, with nothing else, requires bona fide dispute.</b> - It is essential to sustaining of agreement in accord and satisfaction, whereby entire debt or disputed claim is to be satisfied by giving of less sum than that claimed and nothing more, that bona fide dispute or controversy exist between parties; this rule does not have application where damages are unliquidated, or where there is agreement in accord and satisfaction of liquidated claim by giving and acceptance of smaller sum and some additional consideration. Gledhill v. Brown, 44 Ga. App. 670, 162 S.E. 824 (1932).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of disputed claim which will suffice as basis for accord and satisfaction.</b> - In accord and satisfaction of disputed claim it is not merit of contentions of either party which determines its validity to support such accord and satisfaction, its controlling factor being bona fides of debtor's contention, which as a general rule is a question of fact for jury. Nauman v. McCoy, 84 Ga. App. 131, 65 S.E.2d 853 (1951).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where debt in dispute, payment and acceptance of agreed sum constitutes accord and satisfaction.</b> - Agreement by creditor to receive less than amount of the debt may be pleaded as accord and satisfaction where bona fide dispute arises between parties as to certain material terms of original contract and where such subsequent agreement is actually executed by payment of sum agreed upon.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When agreement contains express understanding of new consideration, satisfaction need not be fully executed.</b> - When agreement itself shows either express understanding by parties thereto that it shall itself operate as discharge of prior contract, or when new promise of creditor is supported by new consideration amounting to benefit to creditor or detriment to debtor, satisfaction need not be fully executed. Powers v. American Nat'l Bank, 113 Ga. App. 302, 147 S.E.2d 791 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of tender may be necessary even when agreement supported by new consideration.</b> - Even though new agreement be supported by sufficient new consideration, tender by debtor of amount agreed by creditor to be accepted in satisfaction of prior claim might be necessary in order for debtor to avail oneself of defense of accord and satisfaction. Powers v. American Nat'l Bank, 113 Ga. App. 302, 147 S.E.2d 791 (1966).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Agreement to accept less than full, admitted, liquidated indebtedness not a satisfaction until fully executed,</b> and part payment of lesser amount is not satisfaction of entire debt but only a defense pro tanto. Taylor v. Central of Ga. Ry., 99 Ga. App. 224, 108 S.E.2d 103 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nothing short of actual performance accepted will sustain defense of accord and satisfaction.</b> - Defense based on alleged accord and satisfaction cannot be sustained by offer to perform or actual tender of performance; nothing short of actual performance - meaning thereby, performance accepted - will sustain such defense. Redman v. Woods, 42 Ga. App. 713, 157 S.E. 252 (1931), overruled in part by Worthen v. State, 2019 Ga. LEXIS 22 (Ga. 2019). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Willingness or readiness to pay or perform is not equivalent of performance or payment, and is therefore not satisfaction; nothing short of actual performance or payment, meaning performance or payment accepted, will suffice. Campbell Coal Co. v. Pano, 51 Ga. App. 232, 180 S.E. 139 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant must show full performance and acceptance of alleged accord and satisfaction.</b> - When plea of accord and satisfaction is filed by defendant, defendant must show full performance of the terms by the defendant and full acceptance by plaintiff; unless the defendant shows this, accord is no bar to suit upon original contract or claim.

<p class="p4">One may in fact agree to take less than the full amount in satisfaction of a debt, but the accord, until full execution, is no bar to an action on the original debt. Peters v. Thomason, 157 Ga. App. 513, 277 S.E.2d 798 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Execution of part and tender of performance of residue of accord, insufficient to extinguish cause.</b> - To be good, an accord must be fully executed; execution of part and tender of performance of residue is not sufficient. As long as accord is executory, although it is partially performed, original cause of action is not extinguished. Taylor v. Central of Ga. Ry., 99 Ga. App. 224, 108 S.E.2d 103 (1959).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement on final interest payment as accord and satisfaction.</b> - In an action on a note, summary judgment for the holder was error because an issue of fact remained regarding an accord and satisfaction, given affidavits that the holder agreed to forego collecting on the note in exchange for allowing the holder's mother to live in a home formerly owned by the holder's spouse and upon payment of a final interest payment of $1,500 in 1996, with no further requests for payment until 2010.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relationship with Fair Labor Standards Act.</b> - When employers entered into a contract with a former employee regarding unpaid salary, this agreement did not constitute an accord and satisfaction as to the employee's salary claim because there could not be private settlement of claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 201 et seq. Stout v. Smolar,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(N.D. Ga. Sept. 18, 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Unless specifically agreed to, renewal of promissory note alone is not an accord and satisfaction.</b> Douglas v. Dixie Fin. Corp., 139 Ga. App. 251, 228 S.E.2d 144 (1976).

<p class="p4"><b>Renewal note for less than original note, presumed to settle differences between parties.</b> - New note for sum less than old note, given in renewal thereof, is presumptive evidence that all differences between parties were adjusted and settled when such new note was given. Collier v. Casey, 59 Ga. App. 627, 1 S.E.2d 776 (1939). But see Douglas v. Dixie Fin. Corp., 139 Ga. App. 251, 228 S.E.2d 144 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to support new consideration.</b> - When the money being paid by defendant-purchaser had to be paid in a different manner and on shorter terms than the original promissory notes, it was evidence sufficient to support a new consideration. North Ala. Enters., Inc. v. Cap'n Sam's Cruises, Inc., 181 Ga. App. 718, 353 S.E.2d 578 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Delivery and acceptance of check in full and complete settlement of claim.</b> - An accord and satisfaction occurs with the delivery and acceptance of a check as a stated amount in full and complete settlement of a claim, whether the amount of the claim is established or uncertain. Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Southeastern Ventilating, Inc., 159 Ga. App. 443, 283 S.E.2d 660 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of less than full amount of debt.</b> - When the plaintiff conducted a liquidation sale of property not pledged as collateral for the loan, and the plaintiff applied the proceeds of the sale to payment of the indebtedness, by doing this, the plaintiff gave the creditor additional security which the creditor had no right to demand, and this would constitute consideration for the creditor's alleged agreement to accept less than the full amount of the liquidated debt. South Atl. Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Gibbs, 257 Ga. 521, 361 S.E.2d 167 (1987). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If the debtor tenders a sum of money less than the amount claimed upon the condition, express or implied, that it satisfied the entire debt, and the creditor accepts the tender, an accord and satisfaction results.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Accord and satisfaction may result from acceptance of cash or check.</b> - It matters not whether tender be of cash or check; if check is accepted in full settlement, accord and satisfaction will result.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Binding accord and satisfaction barred all claims between parties.</b> - Because a valid general release entered into by home buyer and home builder effectuated a binding accord and satisfaction, barring any future claims between the parties, and absent evidence to void the release based on fraud, buyer's filed claims in subsequent suit filed against home builder were properly summarily dismissed; thus, assessment of attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion and a penalty for filing a frivolous appeal was ordered. Pacheco v. Charles Crews Custom Homes, Inc., 289 Ga. App. 773, 658 S.E.2d 396 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of check for excessive period of time may work accord and satisfaction.</b> - If party intends to accept check as payment of demand, that check should be promptly presented for payment, usually within a 30-day period. When in absence of circumstances suggesting contrary state of facts, check, although not cashed, is kept for period greatly in excess of this time, such retention may of itself cause debtor to rely on theory that the debtor's offer (accord) has been accepted (satisfaction) in which case creditor no longer has right of action for any excess payment due. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retaining check for unreasonable time without cashing or refusing acceptance as accord and satisfaction.</b> - Retention of check for unreasonable time without cashing and without indicating refusal to accept as accord and satisfaction will constitute acceptance. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga. App. 56, 207 S.E.2d 553 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When check contains language of accord and satisfaction, creditor's knowledge of its purpose conclusively presumed.</b> - When tendered check is accompanied by statement or letter explaining certain claimed deductions, or when check contains express language of accord and satisfaction, creditor's knowledge of the check's purpose is in effect conclusively presumed. Eldon Indus., Inc. v. Paradies &amp; Co., 397 F. Supp. 535 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance and cashing of check accompanied by itemized listing of deductions constitutes accord and satisfaction</b> as a matter of law, at least when evidence is not in dispute that creditor realized, or should have realized, that checks were tendered in full payment of obligation. Eldon Indus., Inc. v. Paradies &amp; Co., 397 F. Supp. 535 (N.D. Ga. 1975).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Satisfaction accomplished by deposit with knowledge that tender was intended as fully settling disputed claim.</b> - When creditor receives and retains a sum of money from the debtor less than amount actually due the creditor with understanding, either express or implied, that it is received by the creditor in satisfaction of the creditor's claim or demand, the creditor cannot thereafter treat it as a nullity and recover balance, and this is so whether the creditor's claim or demand be disputed or undisputed, liquidated or unliquidated. Borden, Inc. v. Barker, 124 Ga. App. 291, 183 S.E.2d 597 (1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Act of depositing check, containing statement of certain claimed deductions coupled with knowledge that it was tendered in full settlement of disputed claim, completes contract of accord and satisfaction.

<p class="p4">When debtor indicated in a new correspondence that it intended the previously tendered check to be full and final payment of the amount the debtor owed to the creditor and the creditor subsequently deposited the check, the debtor was entitled to the defense of accord and satisfaction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-101. Neal H. Howard &amp; Assocs., P.C. v. Carey &amp; Danis, LLC, 244 F. Supp. 2d 1344 (M.D. Ga. 2003). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Claim a bank filed against a corporate debtor's Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate was not barred by the doctrine of promissory estoppel under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-3-44 or the doctrine of judicial estoppel and was not satisfied under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-101 because the bank sued a company that insured property the debtor owned after the debtor's property was damaged in a fire, in an attempt to recover a debt it was owed by a business that was affiliated with the debtor, and settled that case; the bank held a valid claim for money the bank was owed that the bank did not recover from the insurance company and the settlement the bank reached with the insurance company did not affect the bank's right to seek payment of the bank's claim from the debtor's bankruptcy estate. In re PMF Enters. v. SouthCrest Bank (In re PMF Enters.), 517 Bankr. 350 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2014), aff'd, 531 Bankr. 881 (M.D. Ga. 2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Permitting repossession under security agreement, on condition that it extinguish debt, not accord and satisfaction.</b> - If defendant permits repossession only on condition that it extinguish the debt, this falls short of establishing an enforceable accord and satisfaction for it shows nothing more than attempted unilateral imposition without consideration of condition contrary to terms of original contract recognizing immediate right of repossession upon default. Barnes v. Reliable Tractor Co., 117 Ga. 777, 161 S.E.2d 918 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>On facts, retention of stale check did not effect accord and satisfaction.</b> - Mere retention of stale check, where there was knowledge on part of debtor at time that creditor refused to accept it in full satisfaction of unliquidated liability, and which was never cashed and was, at time of summary judgment order, in hands of maker, will not support judgment of accord and satisfaction. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Receipt of stock sooner than contemplated in the original agreement</b> was consideration sufficient to support a new agreement and to constitute an accord and satisfaction with regard to the original agreement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No valid accor and satisfaction.</b> - It was error to find the existence of a partnership between a business owner and the alleged partner as the business was not included in any partnership agreement, described in any recorded statement, or acquired in a partnership name; furthermore, without any record evidence of a settlement agreement between the two, the court also erred in finding a valid accord and satisfaction.

<p class="p4">It was error to find the existence of a partnership between a business owner and the alleged partner, as the business was not included in any partnership agreement, described in any recorded statement, or acquired in a partnership name; furthermore, without any record evidence of a settlement agreement between the two, the court also erred in finding a valid accord and satisfaction.

<p class="p4"><b>Even slight additional advantage or other new consideration to creditor may suffice.</b> - Even slight additional advantage, or other new consideration to creditor, such as a waiver of defense by debtor, or debtor's agreement to surrender possession of realty covered by security deed before the debtor is legally obliged to do so, in exchange for promise by creditor that indebtedness shall thereby be discharged, when undertaking of debtor is fully performed and accepted, is good accord and satisfaction.

<p class="p4"><b>Payment of less than amount claimed may operate as accord and satisfaction when debt unliquidated.</b> - Generally, an essential element to sustain accord and satisfaction of entire debt or disputed claim by giving of less sum of money than that claimed, and nothing more, is a bona fide dispute or controversy; but this rule does not apply when damages are unliquidated. Burgamy v. Holton, 165 Ga. 384, 141 S.E. 42 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Permitting repossession under security agreement on condition that it extinguish debt, not accord and satisfaction.</b> - If defendant permits repossession only on condition that it extinguish debt, this falls short of establishing an enforceable accord and satisfaction for it shows nothing more than attempted unilateral imposition, without consideration, of condition contrary to terms of original contract recognizing immediate right of repossession upon default.

<p class="p4"><b>Party pleading accord and satisfaction must show express agreement or new consideration.</b> - Burden of proof of existence of accord and satisfaction lies with party relying on doctrine which involves, among other things, express agreement or some new consideration.

<p class="p4"><b>Check did not meet criteria for establishing accord and satisfaction not met.</b> - Trial court did not err in granting a creditor summary judgment in the creditor's action to collect the amount the creditor loaned to a debtor because a check a third party sent to the creditor did not meet the criteria of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-103(b) for accord and satisfaction when the cover letter that accompanied the check, which stated that the check was payment in full of the debt, was not an agreement between the creditor and debtor but was, at most, an agreement between the creditor and the third party; the cover letter did not meet the statutory language requiring an agreement between "the creditor and debtor," and sending such a cover letter with a check marked "payment in full," which check was then cashed, was not an "independent" agreement and was not an agreement between the creditor and debtor.

<p class="p4"><b>Deposit by agent without knowledge of controversy or authority to adjust debt, not accord and satisfaction.</b> - Mere authority given agent to endorse check for deposit does not effect accord and satisfaction based upon receipt of check for amount less than that due when agent does not have knowledge of any controversy as to amount of indebtedness or authority to adjust any such controversy.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limited to mind of debtor.</b> - Although the parties agreed that a promissory note signed by the defendant would satisfy the defendant's obligation to pay past due rent under a lease agreement, nothing in the record showed, that, by executing the promissory note, defendants agreed to settle any claims the defendants might have had for the plaintiff's alleged breach of the lease agreement and, in fact, there was no evidence whatsoever that a dispute existed regarding the plaintiff's alleged breach prior to the filing of the defendants' counterclaim; to the extent that the defendant's affidavit revealed that the defendant was aware of possible claims against the plaintiff under the lease agreement, such dispute was clearly "limited to the mind of the debtor," and, thus, the promissory note did not operate as an accord and satisfaction of any and all claims defendants may have had under the lease.

<p class="p4">Where liquidated debt, upon which there is no dispute as to amount due, is agreed to be settled for less than its face value and settlement is consummated by payment of amount agreed upon and execution and delivery of writing stating that it is a release from all further claims, this is an accord and satisfaction and extinguishes all liability therefor by debtor.

<p class="p4"><b>Retention of sum smaller than amount of undisputed debt, not accord and satisfaction absent agreement.</b> - In absence of independent agreement, retention by creditor of smaller sum offered in settlement of claim, as to amount of which there is no bona fide dispute, does not amount to accord and satisfaction.

Logistics Int'l, Inc. v. RACO/Melaver, LLC, 257 Ga. App. 879, 572 S.E.2d 388 (2002). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Executory agreement to accept less than amount claimed requires dispute or consideration to be enforceable.</b> - When agreement has not been fully executed, mere agreement to accept lesser sum than that claimed to be due would require that there exist a dispute or some other consideration. King v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 59 Ga. App. 450, 1 S.E.2d 223 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement to accept less than total liquidated debt requires new consideration or complete performance.</b> - Executory agreement to accept payment of less than total amount of liquidated debt is not obligatory without new consideration or complete performance of agreement, and partial performance will not serve as consideration. Codner v. Siegel, 246 Ga. 368, 271 S.E.2d 465 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Even slight additional advantage or other new consideration to creditor may support accord and satisfaction.</b> - Even slight additional advantage, or other new consideration to creditor, such as waiver of defense by debtor, or debtor's agreement to surrender possession of realty covered by security deed before the debtor is legally obliged to do so, in exchange for promise by creditor that indebtedness shall thereby be discharged, where undertaking of debtor is fully performed and accepted, is a good accord and satisfaction. Mortgage Purchase &amp; Sales Co. v. Williamson, 55 Ga. App. 92, 189 S.E. 293 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Tyler Cotton Press Co. v. Chevalier, 56 Ga. 494 (1876).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bona fide dispute, even without merit, as to amount due, supports accord and satisfaction.</b> - When there is bona fide dispute, even without merit, over amount due, and amount less than amount of debt is accepted in settlement thereof, it amounts to accord and satisfaction of entire debt. Rivers v. Cole Corp., 86 Ga. App. 469, 71 S.E.2d 712, rev'd on other grounds, 209 Ga. 406, 73 S.E.2d 196 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creditor's acceptance, pursuant to agreement, of less than amount claimed, is sufficient consideration.</b> - It would seem that agreement of creditor to receive less than amount of creditor's demand, and payment of money thereunder, is sufficient consideration for such agreement, and stands upon same footing as giving of additional security, or substitution of new debtor, or some other new consideration. King v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 59 Ga. App. 450, 1 S.E.2d 223 (1939).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Extent of accord and satisfaction based on payment.</b> - Jury issue existed as to the extent of the accord and satisfaction of a hospital's claims for treatment provided to a company's employees, and the company's liability for any remaining claims for the employees; as to one set of employees, there was conflicting evidence as to whether a $21,000 check was a settlement for hospital services provided in early 1997 only, or as to all amounts owed for their care from 1997 to 1999. Hosp. Auth. v. Pyrotechnic Specialties, Inc., 263 Ga. App. 886, 589 S.E.2d 644 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Insurance payout was binding accord and satisfaction.</b> - Summary judgment should have been granted for the insurer and the insurance adjusting company because the undisputed facts showed that the insurer and the insured entered into a binding accord and satisfaction, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-103(b); there was no evidence of bad faith with regard to the insurer's settlement discussion with the insured and the attorney as it fully revealed the calculation of the final settlement amount in a letter, and it clearly indicated that no tag, title, or other fees were included. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Evans, 276 Ga. App. 594, 623 S.E.2d 767 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Effect of Retention of Payment</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere retention of check is immaterial.</b> Colfax Gin Co. v. Buckeye Cotton Oil Co., 24 Ga. App. 610, 101 S.E. 697 (1919).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retention of check for excessive period of time may work accord and satisfaction.</b> - If party intends to accept check as payment of demand, that check should be promptly presented for payment, usually within 30-day period. When, in absence of circumstances suggesting contrary state of facts, check, although not cashed, is kept for period greatly in excess of this time, such retention may of itself cause debtor to rely on theory that the debtor's offer (accord) has been accepted (satisfaction), in which case creditor no longer has right of action for any excess payment due. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga. App. 56, 207 S.E.2d 553 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Retaining check for unreasonable time without cashing or refusing acceptance as accord and satisfaction.</b> - Retention of check for unreasonable time without cashing and without indicating refusal to accept as accord and satisfaction will constitute acceptance. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga. App. 56, 207 S.E.2d 553 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Existence of dispute between parties prior to tender of instrument.</b> - Acceptance of a check containing mere words of conditional payment will not constitute an accord and satisfaction unless a dispute as to the correctness of the amount of the debt existed previously to the tender. Sunbelt Life Ins. Co. v. Bank of Alapaha, 176 Ga. App. 628, 337 S.E.2d 410 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absence of bona fide dispute between parties.</b> - In an action to remove a lien on property, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment against the defendant on the basis of accord and satisfaction since it was uncontroverted that the plaintiff and defendant disagreed about the amount plaintiff owed for renovation work before plaintiff tendered a check marked "Payment in Full" to defendant. Kendrick v. Kalmanson, 244 Ga. App. 363, 534 S.E.2d 884 (2000). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence supported a determination that the preexisting dispute between the parties was not a bona fide dispute and that the defendant acted in bad faith both in generating the underlying controversy and in its offer to settle that controversy through the tender of a check. Withington v. Valuation Group, Inc., 249 Ga. App. 8, 547 S.E.2d 594 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of check with conditional language on it not accord and satisfaction.</b> - When there was no evidence of a preexisting bona fide controversy or of an independent agreement, plaintiff's acceptance of checks, even with notice of the conditional language on them, "Pd. in full . . . No Bal. on Paint," and "Pd. in full . . . No Bal. due," did not as a matter of law constitute an accord and satisfaction. Franklin v. Cummings, 181 Ga. App. 755, 353 S.E.2d 626 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of check and endorsement with conditional language was accord and satisfaction</b> - Contractor's acceptance and deposit of a check tendered in partial payment of the contractor's bill for clearing rights of way in a housing development, along with a letter from the developer which stated the developer disputed the amount of work actually performed and that the tendered payment was in full constituted an accord and satisfaction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-103(b) despite the fact that the contractor endorsed the check "with reservations"; thus, the contractor's action for additional payments allegedly owed was barred. Hawthorne Grading &amp; Hauling v. Rampley, 252 Ga. App. 771, 556 S.E.2d 912 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When receipt and retention of check amounts to accord and satisfaction.</b> - Absent agreement, it is only when there is a dispute as to amount due, and one party tenders and other accepts check reciting that it is in payment in full of demand, and check is subsequently paid, that receipt and retention of check can be set up as accord and satisfaction. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga. App. 56, 207 S.E.2d 553 (1974). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Plaintiff's acceptance of a check from the defendants constituted an accord and satisfaction since the defendants mailed letters to the plaintiff detailing the dispute between the parties, indicating that the defendants were tendering an amount less than the total indebtedness set forth under the contract, and stating that an enclosed check, marked "final payment," constituted remuneration for "the balance of the contract," and the plaintiff accepted the payment without condition. Bridges v. Mann, 247 Ga. App. 730, 544 S.E.2d 755 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>On facts, retention of stale check did not effect accord and satisfaction.</b> - Mere retention of stale check, since there was knowledge on part of debtor at time that creditor refused to accept the check in full satisfaction of unliquidated liability, and which was never cashed and was, at time of summary judgment order, in hands of maker, will not support judgment of accord and satisfaction. Studstill v. AMOCO, 126 Ga. App. 722, 191 S.E.2d 538 (1972), aff'd, 230 Ga. 305, 196 S.E.2d 847 (1973), later appeal, 132 Ga.

<p class="p10">Since the free assent of the parties is essential to a valid contract, duress, either by imprisonment, threats, or other acts, by which the free will of the party is restrained and his consent induced, renders the contract voidable at the election of the injured party. Legal imprisonment, if not used for illegal purposes, does not constitute duress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Undue influence defined.</b> - Undue influence which overturns an otherwise legal contract is the exercise of sufficient control over the person, the validity of whose act is brought in question, to destroy one's free agency and constrain the person to do what the person would not have done if such control had not been exercised.

<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance of contract benefits as waiver of duress claim.</b> - When plaintiff takes no action to disaffirm a contract after plaintiff's employment is terminated and, in effect, ratifies the contract by accepting and retaining benefits under the contract, plaintiff waives any subsequent claim that the contract was procured under duress.

<p class="p4"><b>Parties may by mutual consent abandon contract</b> so as to make contract not thereafter binding. Manry v. Selph, 77 Ga. App. 808, 50 S.E.2d 27 (1948); M.W. Buttrill, Inc. v. Air Conditioning Contractors, 158 Ga. App. 122, 279 S.E.2d 296 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mutual consent necessary for rescission.</b> - If a contract is made, one party to the contract can not rescind the contract by merely giving notice to the other of one's intention to do so, without the agreement or assent of such other; but the contract may be rescinded with the assent of both parties. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Gortatowsky, 123 Ga. 366, 51 S.E. 469 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cancellation of guaranty not required to be in writing.</b> - In a creditor's suit on a guaranty, although the guaranty agreement was required to be in writing, a writing was not necessary if the parties mutually agreed to cancel the executory guaranty; however, there was an issue of fact as to whether there was a meeting of the minds between the guarantor and the creditor's manager. Crop Production Services, Inc. v. Moye, 345 Ga. App. 228, 812 S.E.2d 565 (2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of restitution inapplicable to rescissions by mutual consent.</b> - Doctrine of restitution, as applicable to rescission of contracts, applied only when one party sought to rescind contract without consent of other under former Civil Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 4306 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-4-62).

<p class="p4"><b>While actual fraud necessary for rescission at law, equity may allow rescission for constructive fraud.</b> - While only actual fraud will authorize ex parte rescission of sale of personalty so as to enable aggrieved party to sue at law, as in trover, for property that one may have delivered to other under contract, a sale either of realty or of personalty may be rescinded by court of equity for mere constructive fraud, where other essentials of case are established.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In agreement to rescind executory agreement, consideration on part of each is the other's renunciation.</b> - While a valid executed contract cannot be discharged by simple agreement, but only by performance, by release under seal, or by accord and satisfaction, one that is executory (that is, one that has not been acted upon) may be discharged by agreement of parties that the agreement shall no longer bind either of them; consideration on part of each being other's renunciation. Manry v. Selph, 77 Ga. App. 808, 50 S.E.2d 27 (1948); Loadman v. Davis, 210 Ga. 520, 81 S.E.2d 465 (1954).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Surrender by each party of rights under contract is sufficient consideration for rescission.</b> - Contract may be rescinded by mutual consent, in which case surrender by each party of the party's rights under the contract is sufficient consideration; but it is also possible that party to valid contract might require some additional consideration before surrendering valuable rights under the contract.

<p class="p4"><b>When rescission of sale complete.</b> - Rescission of sale is complete as soon as relation of debtor and creditor for whole purchase money is dissolved, and this is accomplished when purchaser holds property for seller, and seller holds notes for purchaser. Steen &amp; Marshall v. Harris, 81 Ga. 681, 8 S.E. 206 (1888).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment improper where material issue of fact remained as to oral rescission.</b> - It was error to grant summary judgment to a corporation in the corporation's suit to recover for services performed for a limited liability company where an affidavit created a material issue of fact as to whether, before the time period for which payment was sought, the parties had mutually entered into an oral agreement rescinding their prior written agreement.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose for statute of frauds</b> is to preclude admission of parol evidence to vary, modify, or contradict otherwise clear agreement. However, rule does not apply in cases where instrument merely shows incompleteness on the instrument's face; under these circumstances, extrinsic evidence is allowed to establish other agreements referable to incompleteness when not inharmonious with basic writing. Module Mobile, Inc. v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, 150 Ga. App. 808, 258 S.E.2d 614 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation of statute does not affect validity of contract for purposes other than enforcement.</b> - Parole contract unenforceable by reason of statute of frauds is nevertheless a valid, subsisting contract as between persons other than contracting parties, for purposes other than recovery upon the contract.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol ratification of agent's unauthorized written contract binds owner.</b> - Parol ratification of contract for sale of land, made by one without authority assuming to act as agent in behalf of owner is valid and binding upon owner, providing agent signed memorandum which in the memorandum's terms complied with provisions of statute of frauds, which showed upon the memorandum's face that the memorandum was executed in behalf of owner. Brandon v. Pritchett, 126 Ga. 286, 55 S.E. 241, 7 Ann. Cas. 1093 (1906), disagreed with, Byrd v. Piha, 165 Ga. 397, 141 S.E. 48 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">One entering into 15-year lease with agent is charged with notice that agent's authority to execute lease is required by law to be in writing and is under duty to inquire and ascertain whether such written authority exists and what limits of authority are, and such person is guilty of negligence in failing to make such inquiry. Union Camp Corp. v. Dyal, 460 F.2d 678 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 849, 93 S. Ct. 56, 34 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1972).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sub-subcontractor's oral agreement held enforceable.</b> - Sub-subcontractor's agreement with subcontractor to complete certain construction work and to submit bills to the subcontractor for the subcontractor's equipment and labor was not within the statute of frauds, and the fact that it was an oral contract did not make the contract unenforceable. Sanders v. Commercial Cas. Ins. Co., 226 Ga. App. 119, 485 S.E.2d 264 (1997).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Parol evidence properly excluded.</b> - Because the lease was required by the statute of frauds to be in writing, the lease could not be modified by an oral agreement, and the trial court did not err in excluding parol evidence of the alleged oral agreements between the parties.

However, the trial court erred by concluding that the property owner had not obtained a parol license to use the strip since the property owner had made expenditures to improve the land and, as to the right of first refusal held by another, the grant of a parol license was not the equivalent to a sale of the property to have in anyway interfered with that right.

<p class="p4">Order dismissing the plaintiff's complaint asserting claims for fraud, interference with the expectation of a gift or inheritance, and constructive trust was affirmed because the fraud claim was based on deeds that were never executed; thus, such deeds were unenforceable on their face and it was impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the plaintiff justifiably relied on the deeds.

<p class="p4"><b>One invoking protection of statute must affirmatively show contract not written.</b> - In suit for specific performance of contract for sale of land required to be in writing by the statute of frauds when allegations of petition do not affirmatively show that contract rested merely in parol, it will be presumed, upon demurrer (now motion to dismiss), that contract was in writing.

<p class="p4">Improper refusal to charge on the statute of frauds was compounded by charging that an oral contract of guarantee is as valid as a written guarantee and constituted harmful error.

<p class="p4"><b>Jury instructions.</b> - Trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on the Statute of Frauds because, while the defendant made an oral, non-specific request, the defendant did not offer a written charge adjusted to the facts of the case; the defendant did not include the defense of Statute of Frauds in the pretrial order and did not move to modify that order; the defendant did not raise the defense of the Statute of Frauds simply by stating that the defendant intended to rely on all applicable statutes governing contracts and all applicable legal principles and rules of contract law, quasi-contracts, and equitable remedies and relief; and the defendant's promise to the plaintiffs was one of indemnity, which generally fell outside the Statute of Frauds.

<p class="p4"><b>Payment in full on oral contract for sale of land.</b> - In a suit for specific performance brought by a plaintiff seeking to enforce an alleged oral contract to sell real property, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant based on the statute of frauds preventing recovery to the plaintiff; the plaintiff had presented evidence establishing the existence of an oral contract for the sale of the property and that it was excepted from the statute of frauds based on the plaintiff's performance of paying for the property in full, and thus, issues of fact remained as to whether defendant's decedent had accepted performance through payments received by a sibling and whether, in light of the plaintiff's previous tenancy, the plaintiff's performance was inconsistent with the lack of a contract to sell the property.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Part payment and possession may be sufficient.</b> - While payment of part of purchase money is not alone such part performance as will take case out of statute of frauds, if accompanied by possession it will amount to such part performance as to take contract out of statute. Wimberly v. Bryan, 55 Ga. 198 (1875); Corbin v. Durden, 126 Ga. 429, 55 S.E. 30 (1906); Harris v. Underwood, 208 Ga. 247, 66 S.E.2d 332 (1951); Sikes v.

<p class="p4">Part payment of purchase money alone, unaccompanied by possession of property, is not such part performance of contract as will render it fraud of party refusing to comply, if court did not compel performance.

<p class="p4">While payment of a part of the purchase-money is not alone such part performance as will take the case out of the statute of frauds, partial payment of the purchase-money accompanied with possession will amount to such part performance as to take the contract out of the statute and to authorize the specific performance of a parol contract.

<p class="p4">Partial payment of the purchase price, unaccompanied by possession or valuable improvements, does not meet the test of part performance. Thus, when the owner of a welding shop, after receiving a down payment, sold the owner's supplies, which were not wanted by the prospective purchaser, to third parties, this was not such a partial performance of the oral agreement as would remove the agreement from the statute of frauds. Zappa v. Basden, 188 Ga. App. 472, 373 S.E.2d 246, cert. denied, 188 Ga. App. 913, 373 S.E.2d 246 (1988). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Part performance of an otherwise unenforceable contract does not entitle party to specific performance.</b> - Trial court erred in finding that a lease-purchase agreement was enforceable because, though the agreement satisfied the statute of frauds, the agreement was invalid for failure of consideration in that the lessee/proposed purchaser never paid the rent owed nor any of the property taxes, which not only invalidated the agreement but voided the purchase option under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-1-8(a). Further, the trial court erred in holding that the lessee/proposed purchaser was entitled to specific performance of the agreement based on repairs made since there was no legal authority to support the trial court's proposition that part performance of an otherwise unenforceable written agreement, as modified by subsequent oral agreements between the parties, transformed the agreement into an enforceable parol contract.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Part performance as will allow specific performance of parol contract to sell land.</b> - Specific performance of executory parol contract for sale of land will be decreed in only two instances. One is where defendant admits contract. The other is where it is so far executed by party seeking relief that if contract be abandoned the party cannot be restored to the party's former position. Full payment alone, accepted by vendor, or partial payment accompanied with possession, or possession alone with valuable improvements, if clearly proved in each case to be done with reference to parol contract, will be sufficient part performance to justify decree. Neely v. Sheppard, 185 Ga. 771, 196 S.E. 452 (1938). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because a contractor's performance and an owner's acceptance of that performance satisfied the requirements of the statute of frauds, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-5-31, and the plats and deeds established the requisite description of the properties to be exchanged, the contractor was entitled to specific performance under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 23-2-131(a).

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Simply bidding at auction insufficient performance.</b> - When the defendant simply made a bid for the property at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, which was accepted by the seller, no partial performance of the contract occurred and the transaction, therefore, stayed within the confines of the statute of frauds. James v. Safari Enters., Inc., 244 Ga. App. 813, 537 S.E.2d 103 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Performance by one in accordance with contract, accepted by other party, removes contract from statute.</b> - In a dispute over installment contract to purchase land, because evidence sufficiently showed that a buyer partially performed a subsequent oral agreement that was not barred by merger clause contained in the contract, and the seller accepted the benefit of such performance, summary judgment to the seller was erroneous; moreover, given that jury questions as to part performance of the oral agreement remained, order denying the buyer's partial summary judgment motion was upheld.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession, to constitute element of part performance must be actual, definite, exclusive and with vendor's consent.</b> - When partial payment, accompanied by possession, is relied upon to take parol contract for sale of land out of operation of statute of frauds, possession of vendee must be actual, definite, and exclusive of the vendor, and with express or implied consent of the vendor. Kinderland v. Kirk, 131 Ga. 454, 62 S.E. 582 (1908).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant's possession and improvements pursuant to contract, with plaintiff's approval, constitute part performance.</b> - When defendant's possession is by virtue of contract of sale, and improvements of property are made with knowledge and approval of plaintiffs and in connection with contract of sale, such possession and improvements are sufficient to remove cause from prohibition of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 20-401 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-5-30), and to bring it within provisions of paragraph (3) of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 20-402 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-5-31).

<p class="p4"><b>Substantial performance and expenditures removed application of statute of frauds from contract involving real estate development.</b> - In a suit brought by a golf course development company against two other members of a limited liability company and a housing authority, the trial court erred by dismissing the golf course development company's oral breach of contract claim for the development of a golf course for a public housing project as, although a writing was required since the alleged contract involved real estate, the golf course development company sufficiently pled substantial performance, expenditures, and reliance to avoid application of the statute of frauds to the claim. Perry Golf Course Dev., LLC v. Hous. Auth., 294 Ga. App. 387, 670 S.E.2d 171 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Possession with improvements must be shown to arise by virtue of oral contract.</b> - When a party seeking specific performance of an oral contract to sell realty relies on the principle of possession with improvements, it must be shown that the possession and improvement arose by virtue of and in the faith of the oral contract or promise, so as to take the case out of the statute of frauds and constitute the equivalent of a writing by showing acts unequivocally referring to the alleged contract or promise. Thus, where a party takes possession under an oral contract to rent, and also alleged an oral option to purchase, the possession is under the tenancy and cannot also be shown to be in reliance on the option. Smith v. Cox, 247 Ga. 563, 277 S.E.2d 512 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment, possession, and improvements removes parol agreement from statute of frauds.</b> - Purchase of land, payment of consideration, taking possession, and making valuable improvement is sufficient to relieve parol agreement for purchase from operation of statute of frauds. Scott v. Newsom, 27 Ga. 125 (1859).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment of purchase money unaccompanied by possession and improvements pursuant to contract, not part performance.</b> - Payment of purchase money, in case of parol contract concerning lands, is not, per se, such performance, or part performance, as will take case out of statute of frauds. But such payment, taken in connection with other acts, as taking of possession and putting improvements on land, will constitute such performance. These other acts, however, must unequivocally refer to, and result from agreement. Black v. Black, 15 Ga. 445 (1854).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What are valuable improvements as will obviate statute of frauds.</b> - Valuable improvements, as related to specific performance, mean improvements of such character as add permanent value to freehold, and such as would not likely be made by one not claiming right to possession and enjoyment of freehold estate. Improvements of temporary and unsubstantial character will not amount to such part performance as, when accompanied by possession alone, will take contract out of operation of statute of frauds. Neely v. Sheppard, 185 Ga. 771, 196 S.E. 452 (1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Creation of parol license to use land did not interfere with existing right of first refusal.</b> - In a suit brought by a property owner seeking to specifically perform an oral agreement to purchase a strip of real estate, the trial court properly denied the property owner's request for an interlocutory judgment based on a violation of the statute of frauds and because another held a first right of refusal over the sale/purchase of the property. However, the trial court erred by concluding that the property owner had not obtained a parol license to use the strip since the property owner had made expenditures to improve the land and, as to the right of first refusal held by another, the grant of a parol license was not the equivalent to a sale of the property to have in anyway interfered with that right. Meinhardt v. Christianson, 289 Ga. App. 238, 656 S.E.2d 568 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Part performance not established.</b> - Sellers were properly granted summary judgment in an action filed by a buyer arising out of an oral land sales contract, given that: (1) no evidence of the buyer's partial performance existed sufficient to remove the contract from the statute of frauds; (2) a wetlands study and interest rate negotiation were not a part of the contract; and (3) a later negotiated contract was an arm's length transaction, the price of which was negotiated at the time, and hence, did not relate to the original contract. Payne v. Warren, 282 Ga. App. 524, 639 S.E.2d 528 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Oral agreement regarding one-third interst in boat ramp.</b> - Grant of summary judgment to the defendants was affirmed because an oral agreement conveying an interest in land was unenforceable under the statute of frauds as the plaintiff failed to present any evidence of part performance to remove the oral agreement from the statute of frauds as the plaintiff did not identify any purported improvements or tax payments made, and the appellate court was not going to cull the record to locate information or facts from over 500 pages of ledgers the plaintiff cited.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Absent provision for liquidated damages, damages accruing by reason of breach shall serve as compensation.</b> - When no agreement fixing amount of damages in case of breach of contract is embraced in contract itself, damages accruing to either party by reason of breach are such as will compensate the party for injury sustained. Spalding Constr. Co. v. Simon, 36 Ga. App. 723, 137 S.E. 901 (1927).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Injured party to be placed in position party would have held had breach not occurred.</b> - Law always seeks to give a remedy commensurate with injury. Injured party is to be placed, as near as may be, in situation the injured party would have occupied if wrong had not been committed. Georgia Power &amp; Light Co. v. Fruit Growers Express Co., 55 Ga. App. 520, 190 S.E. 669 (1937). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>When damage claimed is solely to building or structure, measure of damages is cost of restoration.</b> Georgia-Carolina Brick &amp; Tile Co. v. Brown, 153 Ga. App. 747, 266 S.E.2d 531 (1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Discussion of proof of damage and evidentiary issues.</b> - See McDow v. Dixon, 138 Ga. App. 338, 226 S.E.2d 145 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damage award for a breach of a covenant not to compete cannot be supported by a contractual provision allocating $10,000.00 of the total purchase price to the covenant</b> since there is nothing in the contract to indicate that this was intended to be a liquidated damages provision. Webster v. Purdy, 166 Ga. App. 183, 303 S.E.2d 521 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to consider damages for breach of fiduciary duty.</b> - In a dispute between members of a limited liability company, in light of a stipulated accounting, which proved the defendant was improperly distributing company funds to the defendant and a brokerage firm, the trial court erred by failing to consider whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for the defendant's breach of fiduciary duty. Niloy &amp; Rohan, LLC v. Sechler, 335 Ga. App. 507, 782 S.E.2d 293 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No error in instructions.</b> - There was no error in giving instructions as to general principles regarding the recovery of damages in a contract case when there was no contention that the proper measure of those damages was not also given. Canal Ins. Co. v. Bryant, 173 Ga. App. 173, 325 S.E.2d 839 (1984); Kent v. Brown, 238 Ga. App. 607, 518 S.E.2d 737 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lost profit damages not recoverable for breach of lease.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a lessee's motion for directed verdict in an action by an assignee for damages relating to the expiration of a lease between the lessee and the lessors because the assignee had no entitlement to recover the assignee's lost profits, based on allegations that the assignee could not operate the assignee's own convenience store due to the lessee's failure to timely vacate the premises, since it was limited through the assignment to recover only the remedies available to the lessors, i.e., failure to timely deliver possession and property damages. Golden Pantry Food Stores, Inc. v. Lay Bros., Inc., 266 Ga. App. 645, 597 S.E.2d 659 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Lost profit damages supported by evidence.</b> - In an action by the seller of a gas station against the buyer, alleging failure to make payments on a note, the trial court did not err in finding that the seller breached the parties' agreement by failing to install three gas pumps, and that the buyer was authorized by the contract to install the pumps and to deduct the costs from the amount of the note. An award of lost profits due to the delayed installation and an award of attorney fees was authorized. Spirits, Inc. v. Patel, 350 Ga. App. 153, 828 S.E.2d 381 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to show damages resulted from breach of car rental agreement.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a customer's motion for summary judgment in a car rental company's breach of contract action because the company failed to adduce any evidence that the damages a rental truck sustained resulted from the customer's alleged breach of the rental agreement; the company admitted that customers were not responsible for damage to rented vehicles that occurred after the vehicles were returned to the company's possession and that it would have been consistent with the company's policies and procedures for a customer to return a rented vehicle to the company's premises and leave the keys in the key drop box, and the company offered no evidence to contradict the customer's evidence that the customer's friend returned the truck undamaged to the rental lot, locked the truck's windows and doors, and placed the keys in the drop box.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Zero dollar damages in loan participation agreement.</b> - Bank that was found to have breached a loan participation agreement was properly found liable for zero damages to the owner of a participant's share in the loan; the district court did not err in analogizing to legal malpractice cases to conceptualize expectation interest, and the owner could not show that the payout the owner received was damagingly inadequate absent serious evidence of the owner's expectation interest or the benefit of the owner's bargain.

<p class="p4"><b>Rule against recovery of vague damages applies more to causation than uncertainty as to measure.</b> - Rule against the recovery of vague, speculative, or uncertain damages relates more especially to the uncertainty as to cause, rather than uncertainty as to the measure or extent of the damages. Mere difficulty in fixing their exact amount, when proximately flowing from the alleged injury, does not constitute a legal obstacle in the way of their allowance, when the amount of the recovery comes within that authorized with reasonable certainty by the legal evidence submitted.

<p class="p4"><b>Injured party to be placed in position injured party would have held had breach not occurred.</b> - Law always seeks to give a remedy commensurate with injury.

<p class="p4"><b>Nominal damages are available despite no showing of actual damages.</b> - Trial court erred in granting the plaintiff summary judgment on the defendants' counterclaim for breach of a co-tenancy agreement because the record contained evidence from which a jury could award the defendants' damages, either actual or nominal, from the plaintiff's alleged breach as the injured party has a right to damages, but, when there has been no actual damage, the injured party may recover nominal damages sufficient to cover the costs of bringing the action. 6428 Church St. v.

<p class="p4"><b>No damage award when unable to show damages resulted from breach.</b> - Trial court erred in denying a customer's motion for summary judgment in a car rental company's breach of contract action because the company failed to adduce any evidence that the damages a rental truck sustained resulted from the customer's alleged breach of the rental agreement; the company admitted that customers were not responsible for damage to rented vehicles that occurred after the vehicles were returned to the company's possession and that it would have been consistent with the company's policies and procedures for a customer to return a rented vehicle to the company's premises and leave the keys in the key drop box, and the company offered no evidence to contradict the customer's evidence that the customer's friend returned the truck undamaged to the rental lot, locked the truck's windows and doors, and placed the keys in the drop box.

<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment.</b> - Plaintiff, a surety, asserted (1) that the damages plaintiff sought to recover were a result of the alleged negligent performance by defendant, a construction program manager (CPM), of its contractual duties, including the duty to certify a subsequently defaulting construction company's payment applications; and (2) that plaintiff's damages included the cost of remediating nonconforming work performed by the construction company and certified by the CPM; the surety also presented evidence with regard to which pay applications and which specific items on the pay applications they contended should not have been certified by the CPM and the cost to remediate the nonconforming work.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Nature of loss or injury recoverable as damages for breach of contract.</b> - Damages growing out of breach of contract, in order to form basis of recovery, must be such as could be traced solely to breach, be capable of exact computation, must have arisen according to usual course of things, and be such as parties contemplated as probable result of such breach.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In doubtful cases, courts favor construction which holds stipulated sum to be a penalty,</b> and limits recovery for breach to amount of damages actually shown, rather than a liquidation of damages. Southeastern Land Fund, Inc. v. Real Estate World, Inc., 237 Ga. 227, 227 S.E.2d 340 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Test as to whether provision enforceable as liquidated damages.</b> - In deciding whether a contract provision is enforceable as liquidated damages, the court makes a tripartite inquiry to determine if the following factors are present: first, the injury caused by the breach must be difficult or impossible of accurate estimation; second, the parties must intend to provide for damages rather than for a penalty; and third, the sum stipulated must be a reasonable preestimate of the probable loss. Thorne v. Lee Timber Prods., Inc., 158 Ga. App. 226, 279 S.E.2d 521 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Damages accurately expressed in monetary terms to be distinguished from those which are not.</b> - In determining the validity of a liquidated damages provision in a contract, it is important to distinguish damages which are difficult to accurately determine in monetary terms from those damages which can be accurately established, albeit via a complicated procedure.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Excessive damages are such as shock the moral sense</b> to such an extent as to lead to belief that jury was actuated by undue or improper motives or influences. Central R.R. v. DeBray, 71 Ga. 406 (1883); Candler v. Smith, 50 Ga. App. 667, 179 S.E. 395 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Generous verdict will not be set aside.</b> Bullard v. Rolader, 26 Ga. App. 742, 107 S.E. 548, aff'd, 152 Ga. 369, 110 S.E. 16 (1921); City of East Point v. Hendrix, 27 Ga. App. 485, 108 S.E. 623 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When both parties are at fault, but defendant slightly more so, small damage award is proper.</b> - When evidence authorizes jury to find that both parties are at fault, but defendant slightly more so, so as to give plaintiff a cause of action, a verdict for a small amount of damages is proper and should not be disturbed. Hunt v. Western &amp; A.R.R., 49 Ga. App. 33, 174 S.E. 222 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damages for breach of contract of marriage</b> were governed by former Civil Code 1895, <span class="s1">§§</span> 3803, 3905, and 3907 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-6-4, 51-12-4, and 51-1-26). Parker v. Forehand, 99 Ga. 743, 28 S.E. 400 (1896).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Humiliation and wounded feelings</b> are not elements of damage in action for breach of contract. Harris v. Cleghorn, 121 Ga. 314, 48 S.E. 959 (1904).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When the amount awarded is less than that shown by the evidence,</b> it cannot be said to be palpably unreasonable or excessive. Thompson Enters., Inc. v. Coskrey, 168 Ga. App. 181, 308 S.E.2d 399 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Variance between $118.00 allowed and $130.00 warranted by evidence</b> is insufficient to set verdict aside. Louisville &amp; N.R.R. v. Lovelace, 26 Ga. App. 286, 106 S.E. 6 (1921).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sufficient evidence to calculate damages and interest.</b> - Sufficient evidence was adduced to permit calculation of the amount of the damages, and hence the amount of interest, should the jury find in the jury's discretion that an award of interest was appropriate. Wheels &amp; Brakes, Inc. v. Capital Ford Truck Sales, Inc., 167 Ga. App. 532, 307 S.E.2d 13 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award held proper.</b> - As the testimony established a possible range of damages up to $30,000, the $13,750 damages were within the authorized range for purchaser's breach of a contract to purchase house and lot. Separk v. Caswell Bldrs., Inc., 209 Ga. App. 713, 434 S.E.2d 502 (1993). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Jury's verdict for a vehicle lessee against a dealer in the amount of $10,700 was proper because the evidence showed that the lessee was unable to get a tag decal for the vehicle due to problems caused by the dealer's error in listing the information for a different vehicle in the lease; there was testimony on damages from which the jury could have determined such with reasonable certainty, including, inter alia, loss of use of the vehicle, higher payments on the lease, a higher residual value to buy the vehicle at the end of the lease, and ownership of a less expensive vehicle than what the lessee actually paid. Cent. Auto Sales, Inc. v. Poore, 272 Ga. App. 221, 612 S.E.2d 59 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In a trespassing case, damages awarded under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-12-6 did not show undue bias on the part of jurors because an owner did not seek the replacement value of trees that were improperly cut. Bullard v. Bouler, 272 Ga. App. 397, 612 S.E.2d 513 (2005). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Amount of a jury's verdict of $48,612 in favor of a builder in the builder's breach of contract action against homeowners was not against the weight of the evidence because the jury's actual damage award was well within the range of payment to which the builder was contractually entitled and was otherwise authorized by the legal evidence submitted at trial. Harris v. Tutt, 306 Ga. App. 377, 702 S.E.2d 707 (2010). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In an action by the seller of a gas station against the buyer, alleging failure to make payments on a note, the trial court did not err in finding that the seller breached the parties' agreement by failing to install three gas pumps, and that the buyer was authorized by the contract to install the pumps and to deduct the costs from the amount of the note. An award of lost profits due to the delayed installation and an award of attorney fees was authorized. Spirits, Inc. v. Patel, 350 Ga. App. 153, 828 S.E.2d 381 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award not excessive.</b> - In an action for breach of a construction contract, since the award was less than the contract price and was not extremely in excess of the actual costs spent to complete the construction project, it was not so excessive as to warrant interference under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-4. Pool Markets S., Inc. v. Coggins, 195 Ga. App. 50, 392 S.E.2d 552 (1990). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Jury's award of $200,000 in damages was upheld because the award was not so excessive as to justify an inference of gross mistake or bias. Green v. Proffitt, 248 Ga. App. 477, 545 S.E.2d 623 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Appellate court declined to set aside the amount of the verdict for pain and suffering and wrongful death after a juvenile in a child care institution was accidentally electrocuted because $1,000,000 for pain and suffering and $2,000,000 for wrongful death were not excessive as a matter of law.

<p class="p4"><b>Failure to instruct on nominal damages was error.</b> - Trial court erred in not giving a jury charge requested by a seller in a breach of contract action, to the effect that a party not breaching a contract in a breach of contract action is entitled to at least nominal damages, because the requested charge was a correct statement of law under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-6, it was not substantially included in the instructions given, and the requested charge was adjusted to the evidence in the case; the trial court's failure to give the requested nominal damages charge, coupled with the use of a verdict form that specified actual damages but not nominal damages, improperly removed the issue of nominal damages from the jury's consideration.

<p class="p4"><b>Damages accurately expressed in monetary terms to be distinguished from those which are not.</b> - In determining the validity of a liquidated damages provision in a contract, it is important to distinguish damages which are difficult to accurately determine in monetary terms from those damages which can be accurately established, albeit via a complicated procedure.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In determining whether a provision is for liquidated damages or a penalty, the cardinal tests</b> are intention of the parties, and reasonableness or unreasonableness of amount fixed, according to certainty and ease or difficulty in ascertainment of actual damages, and according to similarity or disproportion between amount provided and actual or probable loss.

<p class="p4">In deciding whether contract provision is enforceable as liquidated damages, the court makes a tripartite inquiry to determine if the following factors are present: first, injury caused by breach must be difficult or impossible of accurate estimation; second, parties must intend to provide for damages rather than for a penalty; and, third, sum stipulated must be a reasonable pre-estimate of probable loss.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Penalty arises when stipulated amount in excess of actual damages.</b> - If actual damages are uncertain and difficult to ascertain or prove, and contract furnishes no data for their ascertainment, the provision will, as a rule, be held to be one for liquidated damages, if amount is not unreasonable. But if actual damages are capable of exact computation under contract and legal rule for their measure, a stipulation for an amount in excess of such damages will generally be deemed a penalty.

<p class="p4"><b>Provision unenforceable when amount stipulated bears no reasonable relation to any probable actual damage.</b> - Agreements to pay fixed sums as damages for breaches of contracts, when amount stipulated plainly has no reasonable relation to any probable actual damage which may follow breach, will not be enforced for agreed amount as liquidated damages, but will be construed as mere unenforceable provisions for penalties.

AFLAC, Inc. v. Williams, 264 Ga. 351, 444 S.E.2d 314 (1994). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A liquidated damages clause in an employment contract, which provided that a computer consultant would pay $50,000 if the consultant failed to provide one month's minimum notice prior to voluntary termination of employment, was unenforceable as such amount bore no rational relationship to actual or potential damages for any breach of contract. Capricorn Sys. v. Pednekar, 248 Ga. App. 424, 546 S.E.2d 554 (2001). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in ruling, after a bench trial, that the contract's liquidated damages provision was an unenforceable penalty because there was no reasonable pre-estimation of probable loss as no evidence was presented that tied the contract's stipulated sum - a half-year's salary - to the probable loss of either the clinic or the doctor upon the other party's breach; the provision stipulated a single, unvarying sum as liquidated damages; it required that single amount to be paid, regardless of which party breached the employment agreement and regardless of what point during the term of employment the breach occurred; and the clinic president offered no explanation for how the contract's designated sum related to those damages. Gwinnett Clinic, Ltd. v. Boaten, 340 Ga. App. 598, 798 S.E.2d 110 (2017).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Unenforceable penalty.</b> - Liquidated damages provision in the real estate sales contract constituted an unenforceable penalty because the broker had not made any efforts to market the property and the broker failed to demonstrate that, at the time the contract was executed, a $53,250 sales commission constituted a reasonable pre-estimate of the broker's probable loss. Sexton v. Sewell, 351 Ga. App. 273, 830 S.E.2d 605 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Considerations in determining whether amount stipulated is not disproportionate to probable loss.</b> - In determining whether amount stipulated as a forfeiture is reasonable, and not disproportionate to damages which could necessarily flow from failure of performance, relation of parties, one to the other, their peculiar situation, absence or presence of fraud or oppression, and purpose agreement seeks to subserve, will in every instance furnish valuable assistance in reaching a fair and just conclusion. Sanders v. Carney, 118 Ga. App. 576, 164 S.E.2d 856 (1968).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Liquidated damages become maximum as well as minimum sum that can be collected.</b> - Breaching party cannot complain that actual damages are less than those specified as liquidated damages. Southeastern Land Fund, Inc. v. Real Estate World, Inc., 237 Ga. 227, 227 S.E.2d 340 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When contract provides for liquidated damages, nonbreaching party cannot elect to take actual damages.</b> - A feature implicit in the concept of liquidated damages is that both parties are bound by their agreement. A nonbreaching party who has agreed to accept liquidated damages cannot elect after breach to take actual damages should those damages prove greater than sum specified. Southeastern Land Fund, Inc. v. Real Estate World, Inc., 237 Ga. 227, 227 S.E.2d 340 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Trial court properly ruled that the agreement between the parties contained an enforceable provision under which the seller retained the $10,000.00 in earnest money as liquidated damages and that the seller's claims seeking to collect actual damages in excess of the agreed damages was barred.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Agreement to deposit specified sum as security for performance as stipulation for liquidated damages.</b> - That the parties agree to deposit a specified sum as security for performance, using language which imports an understanding that upon a breach the holder is to pay such amount over to the injured party without further formality, will generally be held decisive of the intent to stipulate for liquidated damages, though other considerations, of equal weight, may often turn the scale.

<p class="p4"><b>Earnest money provision.</b> - Provision in a real estate sales contract that if "this contract is not consummated by reason of Buyer's refusal or inability to perform, then such earnest money shall be paid to Seller as liquidated damages for Buyer's breach" was an enforceable liquidated damages clause, not an unenforceable penalty. Swan Kang, Inc. v. Kang, 243 Ga. App. 684, 534 S.E.2d 145 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Summary judgment to lender on recission claim properly denied.</b> - Trial court did not err by denying summary judgment to the lead lender on a recission claim because a jury question remained concerning whether the bank's offer to restore to the lead lender any benefits that the lender may have received under the participation agreement was reasonable and it did not matter how the repurchase clause was characterized as the failure to timely repurchase would entitle the bank to pursue money damages. 2010-1 SFG Venture LLC v. Lee Bank &amp; Trust Co., 332 Ga. App. 894, 775 S.E.2d 243 (2015), cert. denied, No. S15C1763, 2015 Ga. LEXIS 702 (Ga. 2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Golden parachute agreement.</b> - Liquidated damages analysis is inapplicable to a "golden parachute" agreement with a corporate officer, where the severance agreement does not purport to be a stipulated sum for damages for a breach, but is the price, in addition to ongoing compensation, for plaintiff's continued performance which plaintiff was not otherwise obligated to render.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Loss, destruction, or failure to return rented item.</b> - When the contract does not contemplate payment of rental until the item is returned, nor payment as to the item's loss or destruction, the measure of damages is the fair market value of the property, that is, if lost, destroyed, or simply not returned, or if damaged, the measure of damages is the difference in the market value immediately before and immediately after the damage.

<p class="p4"><b>Lease late charge provision.</b> - A lease provision for a $50 charge as "additional rent" when a rent check was returned without payment or when the rent was received late met the requirements for liquidated damages when such charge was made to compensate the owner for additional bookkeeping and clerical expenses.

<p class="p4">In a breach of contract action filed by a school against an enrolled student's parents seeking payment of a full year's tuition, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the school as the parents failed in the parents' burden of showing that a liquidated damages clause in the contract amounted to an unenforceable penalty.

<p class="p4">Law permitted parties to contract for liquidated damages precisely because of the difficulty of predicting future events and consequences; thus, the fact that a certain purchaser's purchase of debtor's property may have limited debtor's damages did not establish that liquidated damages of $1 million was not a reasonable estimate of loss if the "stalking horse" purchaser did not purchase the property. Furthermore, the damages flowing from the stalking horse's breach were difficult or impossible of accurate estimation, and the parties intended to provide for damages. Galleria Invs. LLC v.

<p class="p4">District court properly found that the liquidated damages clause was enforceable under Georgia law as: (1) the district court rejected the buyer's challenges to the reasonableness of the $220,000 figure, finding that the amount selected appeared to be reasonably proportionate to the financial injury one might have expected from a breach on the part of the buyer; (2) the Georgia Supreme Court had found reasonable a forfeiture provision providing that a seller of real estate could have retained 10 percent of the purchase price upon the buyer's default; and (3) the agreement showed that the parties clearly contemplated, and intended, for the earnest money to be treated as liquidated damages in the event of a breach.

<p class="p4">Liquidated damages provision in an employment contract was upheld because the employee's injury from the employer's breach was difficult to accurately estimate; the provision was clearly liquidated damages and not a penalty, particularly as it was designated as a liquidated damages provision; and the payments under the provision were reasonable estimates of the employee's probable losses upon the employer's termination or violation of the contract.

<p class="p4">Liquidated damages clause in a hotel licensing agreement was enforceable under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-7 because the agreement was directly related to the past performance of the hotel by using a percentage of gross room revenue generated in the 36-month period prior to termination.

<p class="p4">Liquidated damages provision in an administrative services contract between a management company and health care companies was an enforceable penalty because: (1) the anticipated expenses for the new business venture could not have been easily calculated so that the injury caused by a breach of the contract was difficult to estimate with accuracy; (2) officers who helped negotiate the contract for both sides testified that the liquidated damages provision was meant to compensate the management company for lost revenues in the event of an early termination; and (3) the liquidated damages in the amount of fifty percent of remaining fees under the contract was a reasonable pre-estimate of probable loss.

<p class="p4">In an action for claims arising from a commercial property lease agreement, the trial court did not err in denying the lessee's motion for summary judgment on the lessor's claim for late fees as the lessee failed to show that the late charge was a penalty as a matter of law because the lessee apparently conceded that the actual damages caused by a late payment under the lease would be difficult or impossible to accurately estimate; in construing all reasonable inferences in favor of the lessor as the parties could have intended the late fees either as liquidated damages or as a penalty, the late fees had to be considered liquidated damages; and the fees could have reflected an anticipated increase to the lessor's transaction costs.

<p class="p4">In an action by a shipper against an air carrier for breach of contract and conversion based on lost shipments, punitive damages were not recoverable since there was no evidence of illegal conversion and punitive damages cannot be awarded for breach of contract.

<p class="p4">Amount of punitive damages to a plaintiff in trademark infringement suit evinced the likelihood that the award was based upon the breach of the parties' agreement because the award reflected the 50/50 profit share division of the agreement; thus, the sum awarded suggested that breach of contract, not trademark infringement, was the act for which the jury punished the defendant.

<p class="p4">After a real estate agent's judgment against an owner for tortious interference was reversed on appeal, the court's award of punitive damages was also reversed because its other claims, quantum meruit and promissory estoppel, could not support an award of punitive damages. ASC Constr. Equip. USA, Inc. v. City Commer. Real Estate, Inc., 303 Ga. App. 309, 693 S.E.2d 559 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of willful misconduct, malice, want of care which authorizes punitive damages.</b> - To authorize the imposition of punitive or exemplary damages there must be evidence of willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, or oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of a conscious indifference to consequences. Speir Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Lee, 158 Ga. App. 512, 281 S.E.2d 279 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence of fraud justifies charge on punitive damages.</b> - In an action for breach of contract, when there are matters of record relating to fraud, punitive damages can be awarded. Thus, the evidence of the defendant's participation in a fraudulent scheme justifies a district court in putting the question of punitive damages to the jury. Gower v. Cohn, 643 F.2d 1146 (5th Cir. 1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Punitive damages are recoverable in breach of contract action if fraud is present.</b> - Even in action for breach of contract, when there were matters of record relating to fraud, punitive damages can be awarded, for fraud, if found, is tortious conduct.

<p class="p4">Although the litigation involves contracts of insurance, the plaintiff's alleged fraud, if found by the jury, would amount to tortious conduct, authorizing an award of punitive damages. Guarantee Trust Life Ins. Co. v. Wood, 631 F. Supp. 15 (N.D. Ga. 1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Punitive damages awarded to plaintiff and cross-claimant against defendant are appropriate for conversion as a tort. Privitera v. Addison, 190 Ga. App. 102, 378 S.E.2d 312 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When, on appeal, plaintiff did not enumerate as error the grant of summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff's fraud claim, any claim of error regarding that grant of summary judgment was abandoned; therefore, in the absence of an allegation in the complaint that would support the award of punitive damages, plaintiff's enumeration concerning the grant of summary judgment on the claim for punitive damages was moot. Young v. Turner Heritage Homes, Inc., 241 Ga. App. 400, 526 S.E.2d 82 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">General contractor's punitive damages claim in the contractor's breach of contract action failed under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-10 because the general contractor failed to present evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact on each of the elements of fraud. Apac-Southeast, Inc. v. Coastal Caisson Corp., 514 F. Supp. 2d 1373 (N.D. Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Punitive damages unwarranted when fraud only went to plaintiff's inducement to enter contract.</b> - Because the appellate court could not say that the allegations of fraud went to anything other than a plaintiff's inducement to enter into the contract, and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages for both a breach of contract and a tort claim, the judgment was vacated and the case remanded for the plaintiff to have the opportunity to make an election of remedies. Tankersley v. Barker, 286 Ga. App. 788, 651 S.E.2d 435 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1821, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 742 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Equitable rescission based on fraud may sound in tort, thus justifying punitive damages.</b> - A suit for equitable rescission of contract on grounds of fraud and deceit may sound in tort and the jury may find circumstances of fraud sufficiently aggravating to impose punitive damages. Brown v. Techdata Corp., 238 Ga. 622, 234 S.E.2d 787 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mere failure to perform an automobile repair contract</b> according to the contract's terms, whether attributable to negligence or otherwise, was not sufficient in and of itself to support an award of punitive damages. Hub Motor Co. v. Burdakin, 192 Ga. App. 872, 386 S.E.2d 854 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Real estate contract claim not involving tortious acts.</b> - A jury award of exemplary damages to the seller of a house in the seller's action on a real estate contract against the buyer had to be stricken from judgment, for the action involved neither allegations nor evidence of tortious conduct by appellant which would support an award of exemplary damages. Jones v. Brooks, 174 Ga. App. 12, 329 S.E.2d 300 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Violation of duty flowing from relations created by contract.</b> - Although the relationship between the parties (employer and employee) arose contractually, the employee was not barred from bringing a tort action (and recovering punitive damages) for the violation of a duty flowing from relations between the parties which were created by contract. Atlantic Mechanical Contractors v. Hurston, 185 Ga. App. 511, 364 S.E.2d 638 (1988); Anderson v. Chatham, 190 Ga. App. 559, 379 S.E.2d 793 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Since the jury found for plaintiffs on both the plaintiffs' negligence and breach of contract claims</b> but awarded damages on the breach of contract claim only, plaintiffs could not receive punitive damages. Menchio v. Rymer, 179 Ga. App. 852, 348 S.E.2d 76 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to charge which of multiple counts will support punitive damages.</b> - It was error to deny the defendant's motion for new trial on the issue of punitive damages when plaintiff sued defendant on two counts, only one of which could support an award of punitive damages, but the trial court's charge did not so indicate and the Court of Appeals was, therefore, unable to determine the count on which the jury hinged the jury's award of punitive damages. Marriott Corp. v. American Academy of Psychotherapists, Inc., 157 Ga. App. 497, 277 S.E.2d 785 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Upon reversal of tort recovery, punitive damages reversed.</b> - Since a claim for punitive damages will not lie in cases arising on contracts, having reversed the tort recovery, the appellate court must accordingly also reverse the award of punitive damages. Ebco Gen. Agency v. Mitchell, 186 Ga. App. 874, 368 S.E.2d 782, cert. denied, 186 Ga. App. 917, 368 S.E.2d 782 (1988).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award of specific performance</b> does not, as a matter of law, bar a party from recovering attorney fees or punitive damages. Clayton v. Deverell, 257 Ga. 653, 362 S.E.2d 364 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No recovery since parent company was not a stranger to subsidiary's contract.</b> - Insured could not sustain a claim that the parent insurance company interfered with a policy issued by its subsidiary and induced the subsidiary to breach the policy because the parent company could not be a stranger to the subsidiary's contractual relations; therefore, the insured's claims for tortious interference with contractual relations and punitive damages arising out of that tortious interference were dismissed for failure to state a claim. Perry v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 353 F. Supp. 2d 1237 (N.D. Ga. 2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XII, since it permitted the recovery of attorney's fees absent the prerequisite showings of either O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-14 or O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11, because there was no constitutional requirement that attorney's fees be awarded only pursuant to <span class="s1">§</span> 9-15-14 or <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11; in Georgia, attorney's fees are recoverable when authorized by some statutory provision or by contract, and <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-68, is such a statutory provision authorizing the recovery of attorney's fees under specific circumstances.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Only fees attributable to prevailing claim recoverable.</b> - In an action for damages based on multiple counts, the plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees attributable solely to the prevailing claim.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Success on claim required.</b> - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to appellees on the appellants' claim for attorney fees and expenses under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 because the appellants did not prevail on their only remaining claim; thus, the perquisite to recovery under the statute were not met. Rigby v. Flue-Cured Tobacco Coop. Stabilization Corp., 339 Ga. App. 558, 794 S.E.2d 413 (2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">After the plaintiff was arrested outside the police department where the plaintiff's spouse worked, the district court dismissed all of the plaintiff's state law claims for malicious arrest, malicious prosecution, and false imprisonment; therefore, the plaintiff's Georgia law claims for punitive damages and attorney's fees failed as a matter of law. Perkins v. Thrasher,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F.3d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(11th Cir.

<p class="p4"><b>Showing of reasonableness required.</b> - Trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to the assignee because there was no evidence regarding the reasonableness of those fees. Hagan v. Keyes, 329 Ga. App. 178, 764 S.E.2d 423 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Necessary to present discernable legal argument when challenging award on appeal.</b> - Jury's award of $83,146.20 in attorney fees to the plaintiff was upheld based on the defendant acting in bad faith since, other than an unsupported version of the facts, the defendant made no discernable legal argument challenging the propriety of the attorney-fee award for the appellate court to address. Yash Solutions, LLC v. New York Global Consultants Corp., 352 Ga. App. 127, 834 S.E.2d 126 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to prove amount of fees attributable to successful claim.</b> - Because the evidence of attorney fees was in a lump sum and the plaintiff did not prove the amount of attorney fees attributable to the plaintiff's successful quantum meruit claim, the attorney fees award was reversed and remanded to allow the plaintiff to establish the amount of attorney fees attributable to the claim on which the plaintiff prevailed. Terrell v. Pippart, 314 Ga. App. 483, 724 S.E.2d 802 (2012). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Evidence presented was insufficient to permit a trier of fact to determine what portion of the total amount of attorney time and litigation expenses incurred in the litigation was attributable to only the computer theft/computer trespass claim against the appellants; thus, because the software design company did not prove the amount of attorney fees attributable solely to the claim on which the company prevailed, the award of attorney fees was reversed. Delphi Communs. v. Advanced Computing Techs., 336 Ga. App. 435, 784 S.E.2d 802 (2016).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section not applicable when penalties in another section are exclusive remedy.</b> - Trial court erred in denying the insurer's motion for summary judgment on the insured's claim for attorney fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 because the penalties contained in O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 33-4-6 were the exclusive remedies for a bad faith claim. Thompson v. Homesite Insurance Company of Ga., 345 Ga. App. 183, 812 S.E.2d 541 (2018), cert. denied, No. S18C1044, 2018 Ga. LEXIS 738 (Ga. 2018).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's fees are not recoverable</b> against a defendant in a suit based upon a "statutory liability." First Union Nat'l Bank v. Big John's Auto Sales, Inc., 203 Ga. App. 797, 417 S.E.2d 416 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dischargeability in bankruptcy.</b> - Since the defendant's actions did not rise to the level of willful and malicious conduct, the award of attorney's fees was dischargeable in bankruptcy. Fincher v. Holt, 173 Bankr. 806 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1994).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>New trial required on award of attorney fees.</b> - Bad faith attorney fee award against a university was vacated because the record showed that the professors submitted an itemized bill for their work on the entire case and that none of the testimony about the amount of the attorney fees nor the bill itself provided an adequate basis for the jury to determine the amounts which should be deducted for the unsuccessful conversion claim. Wilson v. Clark Atlanta University, Inc., 339 Ga. App. 814, 794 S.E.2d 422 (2016). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Debt for attorney's fees awarded to creditor in prior state court judgment for defamation was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. <span class="s1">§</span> 523(a)(b) because under Georgia law, it constituted additional, special damages flowing from the underlying tort. Mills v. Ellerbee, 177 Bankr. 731 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1995). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Debt to a creditor awarded in a state court judgment for malicious and willful trespass that damaged the creditor's property, which included attorney's fees, was nondischargeable under federal bankruptcy law because under Georgia law, the award for attorney's fees constituted additional and needless costs for damages that were the consequences of the underlying tort. Stinson v. Morris (In re Morris),<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Dec. 1, 2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Dischargeability in bankruptcy.</b> - Although bankruptcy court found debtor civilly liable to a corporation for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty and to a shareholder for fraud, the court declined to award punitive damages under Georgia law, as finding the debt non-dischargeable was a significant deterrent in and of itself. The shareholder was entitled to an award of attorney's fees because the debtor acted in bad faith with respect to the debtor and caused the debtor unnecessary trouble and expenses, but the corporation was not awarded fees, as it failed on a substantial amount of its damage claims, and its claims were significantly overstated, which extended the litigation and thwarted any efforts at resolution that the debtor attempted. Hot Shot Kids Inc. v. Pervis (In re Pervis), 512 Bankr. 348 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section not limited to "attorney's fees and costs".</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 does not confine itself to "attorney's fees and costs," but instead incorporates the broader term "expenses of litigation." Salsbury Labs., Inc. v. Merieux Labs., Inc., 735 F. Supp. 1555 (M.D. Ga. 1989), aff'd, 908 F.2d 706 (11th Cir. 1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Section provides for damages to plaintiffs but not to defendants.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 provides for bad faith damages to plaintiffs for having to resort to litigation, but not to defendants. Vogtle v. Coleman, 259 Ga. 115, 376 S.E.2d 861 (1989). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Generally, only plaintiffs may recover under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11, and such recovery is available only upon a showing that the defendant's bad faith conduct forced the plaintiff into prosecuting the suit. Salsbury Labs., Inc. v. Merieux Labs., Inc., 735 F. Supp. 1555 (M.D. Ga. 1989), aff'd, 908 F.2d 706 (11th Cir. 1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>True focus of O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 13-6-11 is to punish party that has acted in bad faith.</b> - Relationship between a party's bad faith and amount of damages awarded versus amount sought is generally purely coincidental. Ballenger Corp. v. Dresco Mechanical Contractors, 156 Ga. App. 425, 274 S.E.2d 786 (1980), cert. denied, 156 Ga. App. 425, 274 S.E.2d 786 (1981). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Purpose of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 is to punish a party that has acted in bad faith. Salsbury Labs., Inc. v. Merieux Labs., Inc., 735 F. Supp. 1555 (M.D. Ga. 1989), aff'd, 908 F.2d 706 (11th Cir. 1990).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury charges on attorney's fees under both O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§§</b></span><b> 13-6-11 and 51-7-81 improper.</b> - Trial court erred in charging a jury on attorney's fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-7-81 because a claim under <span class="s1">§</span> 51-7-81 could not be brought as a counterclaim and was premature. The jury awarded fees against both the buyers and buyers' counsel, which was only permitted under <span class="s1">§</span> 51-7-81 and not under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11; because the jury may have based the jury's award on an improper theory, a new trial on attorney's fees was required. Goldsmith v. Peterson, 307 Ga. App. 26, 703 S.E.2d 694 (2010).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Establishment of prevailing party required.</b> - When equitable relief consisted of an order that corrective work be done and it could not be determined if plaintiffs would be required to pay more, less than, or the same amount as defendants, plaintiffs were not established as the prevailing parties. Ellis v. Gallof, 220 Ga. App. 518, 469 S.E.2d 288 (1996).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Underlying tort case must be successful.</b> - When a plaintiff's tort claim for fraud fails, a derivative claim for attorney's fees also fails. Johnson v. Johnson, 323 Ga. App. 836, 747 S.E.2d 518 (2013).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Award granted via summary judgment was inappropriate.</b> - Trial court erred by awarding attorney fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 on summary judgment because the trial court was without authority to award attorney fees on summary judgment since the issue of fees was for the trier of fact. Sherman v. Dickey, 322 Ga. App. 228, 744 S.E.2d 408 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in awarding attorney fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 at the summary judgment stage because attorney fees under that section were a question for the jury. Ga. Lottery Corp. v. Vasaya, 353 Ga. App. 52, 836 S.E.2d 107 (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Choice of law.</b> - Award under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 did not further a Georgia public policy to punish or penalize and, thus, a choice of law provision in the parties' contract electing Illinois substantive law governed the parties' dispute, and under Illinois' substantive law, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 was inapplicable.

Aug. 10, 2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Erie analysis.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 is substantive under an Erie analysis; however, an award under <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 did not further a Georgia public policy to punish or penalize, and, therefore, the choice of law provision electing Illinois substantive law governed the availability of attorney's fees. Elberta Crate &amp; Box Co. v. Cox Automation Sys., LLC,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>F. Supp. 2d<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(M.D. Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Preservation of issue.</b> - Plaintiff preserved the issue of litigation expenses by including in the proposed verdict form (which was part of the pretrial order) a finding of attorneys' fees based on stubborn litigiousness.

<p class="p4"><b>Pending motion when final judgment entered does not extend time for appeal.</b> - Hospital's motion to dismiss an appeal was granted because the order granting summary judgment was a final judgment since the order concluded the case and the fact that the ancillary issue of the cost award under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-4(d) remained pending did not prevent the judgment from being final for purposes of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 5-6-34(a)(1) and 5-6-38(a); thus, the appeal was untimely since the appeal was brought outside of the 30-day time frame from the trial court's entry of judgment.

<p class="p4"><b>Section is generally restricted to plaintiffs.</b> - The very purpose of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 is to prevent the recovery of attorney fees when the recovery would amount to a successful counterclaim against the plaintiff merely for filing suit.

<p class="p4"><b>O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 13-6-11 does not automatically bar recovery by defendant of litigation expenses incurred in prosecuting independent claim.</b> - When a defendant asserts a claim for relief independent of a claim for litigation expenses incurred in defending against plaintiff's case-in-chief, this statute does not automatically operate to bar any recovery by defendant of litigation expenses incurred in prosecuting such independent claim. Ballenger Corp. v. Dresco Mechanical Contractors, 156 Ga. App. 425, 274 S.E.2d 786 (1980), cert. denied, 156 Ga.

<p class="p4">Even though a defendant may not avail oneself of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 in order to recover one's attorney's fees by way of counterclaim, that section should be read to permit the defendant to prosecute a viable, independent claim to recover attorney fees whenever the enumerated statutory criteria are met. Homac, Inc. v. Fort Wayne Mtg. Co., 577 F. Supp. 1065 (N.D. Ga. 1983). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 creates a cause of action for bad faith damages to a plaintiff for having to resort to litigation, no such provision is available to a defendant in the absence of a viable independent counterclaim asserting a claim for relief independent of the assertion of the plaintiff's harassment, litigiousness, and bad faith in bringing plaintiff's suit. Gibson v. Southern Gen. Ins. Co., 199 Ga. App. 776, 406 S.E.2d 121 (1991); Steele v. Russell, 262 Ga. 651, 424 S.E.2d 272 (1993).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Defendant's counterclaim not viable.</b> - When defendant does not contend that defendant's independent counterclaim against plaintiff was viable, it follows that the trial court correctly refused to submit to the jury the issue of defendant's entitlement to a recovery. White v. Lance H. Herndon, Inc., 203 Ga. App. 580, 417 S.E.2d 383, cert. denied, 203 Ga. App. 908, 417 S.E.2d 383 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court erred in awarding a tenant attorney fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 because the tenant's counterclaim was not independent or viable since as a compulsory counterclaim that arose out of the same facts as the complaint, the counterclaim was not independent and could not support an award of attorney fees under <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11; at the first trial, the tenant admitted and the evidence showed that it deducted a mistakenly-paid utility charges from a rent check and was due nothing under the counterclaim, and the tenant repeated those facts to the trial court during the second trial and explained that it was seeking recovery of attorney fees only.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant acting in good faith can recover.</b> - Defendant was not chargeable with the expenses of litigation unless defendant acted in bad faith because the constitutional right to be heard in the courts was granted to defendants as well as plaintiffs.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Requirement of independent counterclaims aside from plaintiff's alleged bad faith.</b> - When defendant did not have viable independent counterclaims asserting claims for relief independent of an assertion of plaintiffs' harassment, litigiousness, and bad faith in bringing their suits, the defendant was not a true plaintiff in a counterclaim so as to claim litigation expenses under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Counterclaim not specifically pled.</b> - Since the record demonstrates on the record's face that the corporate defendant did not specifically plead a viable independent counterclaim for plaintiff's breach of contract such as would otherwise authorize a recovery of attorney's fees, the instant award of attorney's fees cannot be upheld as authorized. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Big John's Auto Sales, Inc., 203 Ga. App. 797, 417 S.E.2d 416 (1992).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Attorney's fees in class action.</b> - Landowners' belated claim for attorney fees could not be asserted in connection with their individual claim, which had already been decided by the appellate court; thus, once the trial court declined to certify the class action claim, nothing remained to which the claim for attorney fees could be attached, and the amendment therefore fell with the class action claim.

However, the evidence did authorize an award of attorney fees to the truck owner for prosecuting the claim to recover for the loss of value to the vehicle as it was uncontroverted that during the pendency of the bailment there was destruction or deterioration to the truck; the truck rebuilding company's assertion that the owner owed the company money was not a viable defense for the company's failure to keep the truck safe. 4WD Parts Ctr., Inc. v.

<p class="p4"><b>Trial court could grant summary judgment on availability of attorney's fees, but question of punitive damages was for jury.</b> - Tenant whose former landlord cashed a check for property taxes that the tenant mailed to the landlord by mistake was entitled to summary judgment on a claim for conversion and bad faith attorney's fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11; however, under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-12-5.1(d), the question of whether punitive damages should be awarded and the amount thereof was for a jury.

<p class="p6"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jury Instructions</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury charge must specify provisions authorizing attorney fees.</b> - When a party seeks recovery of attorney fees from an opponent pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11, the court's charge to the jury must specify the provisions of the section which would authorize a jury verdict or attorney fees. Spivey v. Rogers, 173 Ga. App. 233, 326 S.E.2d 227 (1984). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Because the party pursuing attorney's fees and expenses under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 did not submit a jury charge under the statute, no error resulted in the jury's failure to award attorney's fees and expenses under the theory presented. Gold Kist, Inc. v. Base Mfg., 289 Ga. App. 690, 658 S.E.2d 228 (2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to instruct harmless error.</b> - While O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 appears in the contracts section of the code, it is universally applied when the underlying suit is not in contract; however, when the underlying claims in a case should not have been allowed to go to the jury, the refusal to charge the jury on awarding attorney fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 was harmless error. Bacon v. Volvo Serv. Ctr., Inc., 266 Ga. App. 543, 597 S.E.2d 440 (2004).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury is authorized to consider damages despite absence of specific instructions.</b> - Where, when trial court gave the court's general charge to the jury on liability and damages, the trial court gave no instructions regarding the recoverability of attorney's fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11, when despite this absence of specific instructions, the jury nevertheless included in the jury's verdict an award to appellees of attorney's fees, and when at the time that verdict was returned, defendants did not object to its inclusion of an award of attorney's fees and the jury was dispersed, the award of attorney fees was correct despite the absence of specific instructions by the trial court; since the recoverability of damages is dependent upon the applicable law and evidence, and not upon the instructions of the trial court, since defendants did not contest the sufficiency of the evidence to authorize the $8,008.08 verdict in attorney's fees, and since defendants failed to object to the verdict at the time the verdict was returned, the award of attorney's fees was sustained. Ring v. Williams, 192 Ga. App. 329, 384 S.E.2d 914 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Failure to object to jury instruction on attorney fees for stubborn litigiousness.</b> - In an action in which a widow sued an insurer for failing to pay benefits under a life insurance policy, and the jury found the insurer was not guilty of bad faith in the insurer's refusal to pay these benefits but that the insurer was stubbornly litigious, the insurer's argument on appeal that the jury was not authorized to award attorney fees for stubborn litigiousness was not preserved for appeal because the insurer did not present that argument to the trial court and did not object to a jury instruction on awarding attorney fees for stubborn litigiousness. Cherokee Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Eason, 276 Ga. App. 183, 622 S.E.2d 883 (2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to support instruction on bad faith.</b> - When the trial court instructed the jury that expenses of litigation may be allowed under the three conditions enumerated by the trial court (encompassing the provisions of O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11), that it was necessary to show one of the three conditions existed in order to recover attorney fees, but that any one of the three may authorize such damages, and the evidence adduced at trial showed that defendant obtained a writ of possession by swearing that plaintiffs had failed to pay monies due the defendant which instead were shown to be due to third parties (namely, the finance company and the lot manager of the mobile home park) and that defendant, together with the other defendants, first emptied plaintiffs' mobile home of the home's belongings and then drove off taking some of plaintiffs' belongings with the defendants, and leaving the rest to be taken by unknown third parties, this evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's charge to the jury on the issue of attorney fees under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11, particularly the bad faith section of that statute. Sanders v. Hughes, 183 Ga. App. 601, 359 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 183 Ga. App. 907, 359 S.E.2d 396 (1987).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Jury instruction on bad faith.</b> - Jury was properly charged on bad faith as an avenue for attorney fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 as a pretrial order did not exclude bad faith as an avenue of recovery; the trial court did not err in charging the jury that the jury could award attorney fees if the defendants had acted in bad faith, had been stubbornly litigious, or had caused the client unnecessary trouble and expense. As the trial court did not err in charging on bad faith, the trial court did not compound the error or commit reversible error by charging the jury that "where a jury (was) authorized to find fraud, it (was) authorized to find bad faith." Gerschick v. Pounds, 281 Ga. App. 531, 636 S.E.2d 663 (2006), cert. denied, No. S07C0191, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 95 (Ga. 2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No error in instructions.</b> - Trial court did not err in giving a charge paraphrasing O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-11 since the charge was warranted by the evidence.

<p class="p4">In a suit against an insurer under a policy covering oriental rugs, when several of the insured's rugs sustained water damage and others were stolen, because damages for the water damage claim were not liquidated, the trial court did not err in denying an award of prejudgment interest on that claim; however, inasmuch as the theft claim was for liquidated damages, the court erred in not awarding prejudgment interest on that claim.

<p class="p4">There is no error in allowing prejudgment interest in breach of contract cases to be found by the jury as a separate item of the award, even where the damages are not liquidated.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prejudgment interest may be obtained in action for unliquidated damages.</b> - O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-13 allows for prejudgment interest to be awarded by a jury even on unliquidated claims. However, a prerequisite to the award of prejudgment interest is that the jury's finding of damages be the same as the amount of damages at the time of the breach. For interest to be permitted on an unliquidated claim, there must be a monetary loss which "immediately and necessarily" flows to the injured party. Malta Constr. Co. v.

<p class="p4"><b>Prejudgment interest not authorized when only remedy was specific performance.</b> - In a case arising out of breach of a stock purchase agreement, in which the trial court ordered specific performance of the agreement for a purchase price of $1.2 million, the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-13 because <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-13 only allowed interest on "damages" and did not apply to specific performance.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prejudgment interest award was proper.</b> - Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the issue of prejudgment interest where the court's charge on prejudgment interest as given was an accurate and complete statement of the law and where entry of judgment based on the findings of the jury as to the amount of interest calculated from the exhibits in evidence was proper. Bishop Contracting Co. v. North Ga. Equip. Co., 203 Ga. App. 655, 417 S.E.2d 400, cert. denied, 203 Ga. App. 905, 417 S.E.2d 400 (1992). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Award of prejudgment interest was proper in a hospital's breach of contract action, wherein it was awarded judgment in its favor on a claim for recovery of monies due that had been loaned to a doctor who did not repay the full sum; pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 7-4-15 and 13-6-13, where the balance was a liquidated amount, as here, the court was authorized to award prejudgment interest.

<p class="p4">Summary judgment for a city for $2,885,827 damages, plus pre-judgment interest under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-13, was proper on the city's claim against a county and its tax commissioner for breach of an agreement under which the county was required to collect the city's taxes and remit them to the city, but instead withheld $2,885,827 for a tax refund obligation owed by the county. Ferdinand v. City of E. Point, 301 Ga. App. 333, 687 S.E.2d 617 (2009). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In breach-of-contract actions in all cases where an amount ascertained would be the damages at the time of the breach, it may be increased by the addition of legal interest from that time until the recovery.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prejudgment interest award not required.</b> - Although O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-6-13 authorizes a separate award of prejudgment interest, the law does not require such an award.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>In cases involving unliquidated damages, allowance of interest is within jury's discretion.</b> - It is error for trial judge in a case involving unliquidated damages to instruct jury that plaintiff is entitled to interest, since in such a case allowance of interest is a matter within jury's discretion. Smith v. Maples, 114 Ga. App. 529, 151 S.E.2d 815 (1966) but see Eastern Fed. Corp. v. Avco-Embassy Pictures Corp., 331 F. Supp. 1253 (N.D. Ga. 1971). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Although it is reversible error for judge to instruct jury that the jury must award interest in actions for unliquidated damages arising from breach of contract, a jury may, in the jury's discretion, increase immediate amount of damages found by an allowance of interest. Norair Eng'r Corp. v. Saint Joseph's Hosp., 147 Ga. App. 595, 249 S.E.2d 642 (1978). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When damages are unliquidated, the Georgia Court of Appeals has apparently relegated award of prejudgment interest to discretion of jury. United States ex rel. Delta Metals, Inc. v. R.M. Wells Co., 497 F. Supp. 541 (S.D. Ga. 1980).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Increasing damages by allowing interest.</b> - In action for breach of contract, where damages are not liquidated, interest is not recoverable as such; but jury in the jury's discretion may increase immediate amount of damages found by an allowance of interest. Bennett v. Tucker &amp; Pennington, 32 Ga. App. 288, 123 S.E. 165 (1924); United States ex rel. Delta Metals, Inc. v. R.M. Wells Co., 497 F. Supp. 541 (S.D.

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relationship to bankruptcy law.</b> - Although the court found that the debtor owed a specific amount to the creditor at the time the bankruptcy case was filed and as scheduled, affirmative defenses of recoupment and setoff were preserved, and the party objecting to the creditor's claim could assert those defenses to reduce the creditor's claims if the defenses were permitted under state law (here, Georgia). Whether called setoff or recoupment, it was undisputed that the debtor paid an amount to the bank to satisfy the creditor's primary obligation to that bank, and it was also undisputed that the obligation of the debtor to the creditor arose when the debtor borrowed money that originated from the bank; thus, under any theory the debtor would get the benefit of the amount the debtor paid on the bank's debt, reducing the creditor's claim accordingly. In re Bay Circle Props., LLC,<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bankr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Apr. 3, 2020).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setoff as not defeating plaintiff's claim, regardless of legal or equitable nature of setoff.</b> - Existence of valid right of setoff does not operate to defeat plaintiff's claim, although it might preclude plaintiff's recovery of any actual damages, and this is true regardless of the assertion of the setoff as a legal right or an equitable right. National City Bank v. Busbin, 175 Ga. App. 103, 332 S.E.2d 678 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setoff as counterclaims, not defense.</b> - When defendant asserts a setoff of mutual demands existing at the time of commencement of the action, the setoff must be asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense. National City Bank v. Busbin, 175 Ga. App. 103, 332 S.E.2d 678 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In general, parties to a suit are entitled to set off mutual demands existing at the time of the commencement of the suit, but such a set off must be asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense, since it does not operate as a denial of the plaintiff's claim, but merely allows the defendant to set off a debt owed the defendant by the plaintiff against that claim. Stewart v. Stewart, 236 Ga. App. 348, 511 S.E.2d 919 (1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right of setoff in cases other than those covered by O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 13 is an equitable right.</b> - Right to set off one legal demand against another, other than in cases covered by former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 20-1301 et seq. (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 13), was an equitable right, which was not and had never been recognized by a court of law in this state, except in obedience to a statute, and therefore it can be asserted only in a court having jurisdiction in equity matters.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Doctrine of recoupment is but an improvement upon old doctrine of failure of consideration.</b> Toole v. Brownlow &amp; Sons Co., 151 Ga. App. 292, 259 S.E.2d 691 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recoupment goes to show that amount claimed is not due plaintiff.</b> Weaver v. Roberson, 134 Ga. 149, 67 S.E. 662 (1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recoupment sums up grievances on each side, strikes balance, and gives judgment for difference.</b> - Recoupment looks through the whole contract, treating the contract as an entirety, and regarding things done and stipulated to be done on each side as consideration for things done and stipulated to be done on the other; and when plaintiff seeks redress for breach of stipulations in plaintiff's favor, it sums up grievances on each side, strikes a balance, and gives plaintiff a judgment for only such difference as may be found in plaintiff's favor. Mashburn Drug Co. v. Valdosta Drug Co., 53 Ga. App. 88, 184 S.E. 903, rev'd on other grounds, 183 Ga. 471, 188 S.E. 694 (1936); Atlas Auto Fin. Co. v. Atkins, 79 Ga. App. 91, 53 S.E.2d 171 (1949); Toole v. Brownlow &amp; Sons Co., 151 Ga. App. 292, 259 S.E.2d 691 (1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between recoupment and setoff.</b> - Ordinarily the difference between recoupment and setoff is of little importance. The scheme of the Code is to recoup where both parties rely on the same contract, and set off where they urge different contracts. Byrom v. Ringe, 83 Ga. App. 234, 63 S.E.2d 235 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When a defendant claims a right to a deduction from the plaintiff's damages for breach of a cross obligation arising from the same contract, the proper remedy is recoupment, not setoff. Johnson v. Raatz, 200 Ga. App. 289, 407 S.E.2d 489 (1991).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plea of recoupment is confined to contract sued upon by plaintiff,</b> including any cross-obligation or independent covenant arising out of that contract. A plea of setoff is not so confined, but is a defense which goes not to justice of plaintiff's demand, but which sets up a demand against plaintiff, and which includes all mutual debts and liabilities. Bibb Basket Co. v. Eufaula Bank &amp; Trust Co., 42 Ga. App. 394, 156 S.E. 310 (1930).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Recoupment not allowed as to matters contained in a contract separate from one sued upon.</b> Copeland v. White, 17 Ga. App. 565, 87 S.E. 846 (1916).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Defendant's remedy for breach by plaintiff is recoupment, not nonpayment.</b> - Late performance may constitute breach of contract by plaintiff, but remedy for breach is not nonpayment; it is recoupment or what is now a counterclaim. Sasser &amp; Co. v. Griffin, 133 Ga. App. 83, 210 S.E.2d 34 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Causes of action ex delicto cannot be set off against suit proceeding ex contractu, except in some special instances.</b> - While damages resulting from the plaintiff's breach of a contract sued on may be set off by plea of recoupment, still this right of setoff is not broad enough to include damages alleged to have arisen from plaintiff's wrongful act in connection with a transaction legally distinct from contract sued on, even though closely connected with it in point of time. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Lunsford, 179 Ga. 716, 177 S.E. 727 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Burden of proof in plea of recoupment.</b> - When plaintiff has made out a prima facie case by proof of delivery and acceptance of goods, defendant has burden of proving facts set up under defendant's plea of recoupment, and damage thereby. Gem Knitting Mills v. Empire Printing &amp; Box Co., 3 Ga. App. 709, 60 S.E. 365 (1908); Phillips v. Lindsey, 31 Ga. App. 479, 120 S.E. 923 (1923).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>No right to recoupment established.</b> - Trial court was authorized to conclude that the buyers were not entitled to recover on the buyers' recoupment claim made in the context of the sellers' suit on three promissory notes; a management agreement was a sham, and the evidence showed that no money was paid thereunder; further, money paid as a downpayment on a business sale contract and additional money paid to one of the sellers in return for services were voluntarily paid, and the evidence did not demand a finding of an overpayment or payment on account of fraud, accident, or mistake. Park v. Fortune Ptnr., Inc., 279 Ga. App. 268, 630 S.E.2d 871 (2006).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relationship to bankruptcy law.</b> - Although the court found that the debtor owed a specific amount to the creditor at the time the bankruptcy case was filed and as scheduled, affirmative defenses of recoupment and setoff were preserved, and the party objecting to the creditor's claim could assert those defenses to reduce the creditor's claims if the defenses were permitted under state law (here, Georgia). Whether called setoff or recoupment, it was undisputed that the debtor paid an amount to the bank to satisfy the creditor's primary obligation to that bank, and it was also undisputed that the obligation of the debtor to the creditor arose when the debtor borrowed money that originated from the bank; thus, under any theory the debtor would get the benefit of the amount the debtor paid on the bank's debt, reducing the creditor's claim accordingly.

<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between recoupment and setoff.</b> - Plea of recoupment is confined to contract sued upon by plaintiff, including any cross-obligation or independent covenant arising out of that contract. A plea of setoff is not so confined, but is a defense which goes not to the justice of plaintiff's demand, but which sets up a demand against plaintiff, and which includes all mutual debts and liabilities.

<p class="p4">Ordinarily, the difference between recoupment and setoff is of little importance. The scheme of the Code is to recoup where both parties rely on same contract, and set off where they urge different contracts. Byrom v. Ringe, 83 Ga. App. 234, 63 S.E.2d 235 (1951). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Setoff as not defeating plaintiff's claim, regardless of legal or equitable nature of setoff.</b> - Existence of valid right of setoff does not operate to defeat plaintiff's claim, although it might preclude plaintiff's recovery of any actual damages; and this is true regardless of the assertion of the setoff as a legal right or an equitable right. National City Bank v. Busbin, 175 Ga. App. 103, 332 S.E.2d 678 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setoff must be between same parties and in their own legal or equitable right.</b> Shingler v. Furst, 176 Ga. 497, 168 S.E. 557 (1933).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mutuality of obligation is required for a valid setoff.</b> Brunson v. Bridges, 130 Ga. App. 102, 202 S.E.2d 553 (1973).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>If demands are mutual and of same nature, setoff need not arise between same parties.</b> - Right of setoff, under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 20-1301, 20-1302, and 20-1303 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-7-1, 13-7-4, and 13-7-5), if demands were mutual and of the same nature, was not limited to mutual dealings, and need not arise between same parties. Thus, a transferred chose in action, which can be sued on in name of assignee, may be used as a setoff. Wood v. Keysville Lumber Co., 49 Ga. App. 799, 175 S.E. 923 (1934).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Setoff as counterclaim, not defense.</b> - When defendant asserts a setoff of mutual demands existing at the time of commencement of the action, the setoff must be asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense. National City Bank v. Busbin, 175 Ga. App. 103, 332 S.E.2d 678 (1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In general, parties to a suit are entitled to set off mutual demands existing at the time of the commencement of the suit, but such a setoff must be asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense, since it does not operate as a denial of the plaintiff's claim, but merely allows the defendant to set off a debt owed the defendant by the plaintiff against that claim. Stewart v. Stewart, 236 Ga. App. 348, 511 S.E.2d 919 (1999). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When defendant's claim for monies due on a promissory note ceased to be a counterclaim when it was severed and transferred to another court for adjudication as an original action, the defendant could not assert defendant's claim as a set off defense in the now separate suit on the promissory note.

<p class="p4"><b>Judgment assignee subject to equities and defenses of judgment debtor against judgment creditor at assignment.</b> - Claim of assignee of a judgment is subject to such equities and defenses as may have existed in favor of judgment debtor against judgment creditor at time of assignment, but is not subject to rights which did not then exist in favor of such judgment debtor and of which judgment debtor did not become possessed until some time later as by subsequent purchase of judgments against the judgment creditor.

Ch. 7, T. 13), is an equitable right, which is not and has never been recognized by a court of law in this state, except in obedience to a statute, and therefore it can be asserted only in a court having jurisdiction in equity matters.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plea must show that demand against plaintiff was due at time plaintiff commenced action.</b> - A plea of setoff is not good unless the plea alleges facts showing that demand against plaintiff, which defendant therein seeks to set up, was in existence, and due to latter by former, at time plaintiff's action was begun. Nixon v. Nixon, 194 Ga. 301, 21 S.E.2d 702 (1942).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mortgagor-mortgagee obligations.</b> - When a note and a deed to secure debt is owed by the mortgagor to the mortgagees, who are tenants in common (i.e., a husband "and/or" his wife), while a subsequent judgment arising out of an action on the building contract is owed by one of the mortgagees to the mortgagor, these debts can be said to be "mutual" and can be set off against each other in a bankruptcy proceeding by the judgment debtor-mortgagee. Straughair v. Palmieri, 31 Bankr. 111 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Relationship to bankruptcy law.</b> - Although the court found that the debtor owed a specific amount to the creditor at the time the bankruptcy case was filed and as scheduled, affirmative defenses of recoupment and setoff were preserved, and the party objecting to the creditor's claim could assert those defenses to reduce the creditor's claims if the defenses were permitted under state law (here, Georgia). Whether called setoff or recoupment, it was undisputed that the debtor paid an amount to the bank to satisfy the creditor's primary obligation to that bank, and it was also undisputed that the obligation of the debtor to the creditor arose when the debtor borrowed money that originated from the bank; thus, under any theory the debtor would get the benefit of the amount the debtor paid on the bank's debt, reducing the creditor's claim accordingly.

<p class="p4"><b>Word's "mutual demands," as applied to debts, imports that there must be reciprocal obligations</b> between the parties. Thus, a defendant cannot ordinarily set off an indebtedness held against plaintiff and another, since it is not a mutual demand. Wolfe v. Citizens' Bank, 26 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Demand of any one defendant can be set off in action against them severally.</b> - Where two or more defendants are joined in action to which the defendants are severally liable, and in which a separate judgment may be taken against each defendant, a cross-demand in favor of any one defendant against plaintiff may be setoff.

<p class="p4"><b>Applicability of section to proceeding by judgment debtor to set off judgment against judgment creditor.</b> - In proceeding by judgment debtor to set off a judgment assigned to the debtor against a judgment rendered against the debtor, word "suit", if it has any application, refers to judgment debtor's proceeding to set off, rather than to suit resulting in judgment against the debtor.

<p class="p4"><b>Debts due widow by estate cannot be set off against heirs unless estate's representative is a party.</b> - Debts due widow by estate of her deceased husband are not based on a course of dealing with an heir, or heirs of his estate, and cannot form basis of action by widow against other heir, or heirs, without making legal representative of estate of deceased a party thereto; since items relied upon by defendant to support her contention that her answer contains proper matters for setoff are not such demands as could have been maintained by defendant in direct proceeding against plaintiff, equity will not sanction a proceeding to accomplish indirectly that which the law prohibits.

<p class="p4"><b>Recoupment based on negligent act not assertable in defense of debt claim.</b> - Summary judgment under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 9-11-56(c) was properly granted to a creditor in the creditor's action seeking to collect on a debt, since the debtor's defense consisted of a claim in recoupment, pursuant to O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-7-2 and 13-7-13, based on personal injuries the debtor suffered from the negligent conduct of the creditor; the court ruled that such a defense was not applicable to the creditor's claim because the claims were legally distinct. Long v. Reeves Southeastern Corp., 259 Ga. App. 257, 576 S.E.2d 641 (2003).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Damage to defendant from plaintiff's negligent or improper performance may be pleaded in recoupment.</b> - When defendant's plea of recoupment seeks to recoup against plaintiff's action on contract with a plea that defendant was forced to spend a certain amount of money to have conveyor system, which the plaintiff erected under contract, repaired due to unskillful and improper manner in which plaintiff did certain of the work, motion to strike plea of recoupment was properly denied. Burton v. Campbell Coal Co., 95 Ga. App. 338, 97 S.E.2d 924 (1957). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In action on note given for purchase price of property or in payment or part payment of contract price agreed to be paid for performance of work and labor, it is competent for defendant to set off any claim the defendant may have against plaintiff arising out of performance of work embodied in contract, including damages arising by reason of failure of plaintiff to perform contract in accordance with the contract's terms. Williams v. Metropolitan Home Imp. Co., 110 Ga. App. 770, 140 S.E.2d 56 (1964). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">While it is true that on acceptance of work by owner after building contractor has rendered entire service for which owner has contracted, the contractor is authorized to proceed to collect balance due the contractor by terms of contract, any damage to owner resulting from negligent performance of contract by contractor is a matter for recoupment. Sasser &amp; Co. v. Griffin, 133 Ga. App. 83, 210 S.E.2d 34 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Recoupment, by way of cross-action, does not arise ex delicto</b> and does not require affirmative equitable relief. Allied Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, 93 Ga. App. 832, 93 S.E.2d 392 (1956).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Application of doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to plea of recoupment.</b> - In order for doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to be applicable when defendant in a plea of recoupment alleged that plaintiff was not entitled to recover for construction of conveyor system because of improper construction of the system, defendant must show plaintiff had control of premises.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Freedom of contract generally.</b> - Absent a limiting statute or controlling public policy, parties may contract with one another on whatever terms the parties wish, and the written contract defines the full extent of the parties' rights and duties. In the absence of a public policy question, parties may contract to waive numerous and substantial rights. Basic Four Corp. v. Parker, 158 Ga. App. 117, 279 S.E.2d 241 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Power of parties to contract as parties please is modified by O.C.G.A. Art. 1, Ch. 8, T. 13 and O.C.G.A. </b><span class="s1"><b>§</b></span><b> 11-2-302(1).</b> - While it was a general rule in this state that parties may contract as the parties please subject to exceptions of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 20-501 et seq. (see O.C.G.A. Art. 1, Ch. 8, T. 13), former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 109A-2-302 (see O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 11-2-302(1)) modified this general rule that parties were free to make whatever contracts the parties please so long as there was no fraud or illegality, by giving courts discretion to refuse to enforce sales contracts under Georgia Uniform Commercial Code, in whole or in part, which the courts find to be unconscionable. Chrysler Corp. v. Wilson Plumbing Co., 132 Ga. App. 435, 208 S.E.2d 321 (1974).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Illegal contracts are unenforceable whether malum in se or malum prohibitum.</b> - In applying rule that no recovery can be had in action to enforce an illegal contract, no distinction is recognized between a contract whose object is malum in se and one whose object is malum prohibitum. Raleigh &amp; G.R.R. v. Swanson, 102 Ga. 754, 28 S.E. 601, 39 L.R.A. 275 (1897); McAndrew v. Taylor, 15 Ga. App. 555, 83 S.E. 967 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Courts of equity will not aid either party to executed immoral or illegal contract.</b> Watkins v. Nugen, 118 Ga. 372, 45 S.E. 262 (1903).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>An illegal contract if executed will be left to stand, if executory, will not be enforced.</b> - Insofar as illegal contracts have been executed or performed, a court will not disturb the contracts, but will leave parties where it finds the parties; and insofar as such contracts are not executed or performed, a court will afford no aid whatever to enforce the contracts. City Council v. Dawson Waterworks Co., 106 Ga. 696, 32 S.E. 907 (1899); Beard v. White, 120 Ga. 1018, 48 S.E. 400 (1904). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Contract to do an immoral or illegal thing is void, and if such contract is executory, neither party can enforce the contract, but if executed, the contract will be allowed to stand. Quinton v. Millican, 196 Ga. 175, 26 S.E.2d 435 (1943). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If a contract is illegal as against public policy, the contract's invalidity will be a defense while the contract remains unexecuted. If such a contract is in part performed, and money has been paid in pursuance of the contract, no action will lie to recover the money back. Jones v. Faulkner, 101 Ga. App. 547, 114 S.E.2d 542 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts will not interpose to grant any relief to parties to illegal contract.</b> - When parties are engaged in illegal transactions, whether malum prohibition or malum in se, courts of this state will not interpose to grant any relief; in such cases the rule is for the court to leave parties where it finds the parties, no matter whether illegality of contract appears from plaintiff's case or is set up by way of defense. Sheehan v. City Council, 71 Ga. App. 233, 30 S.E.2d 502 (1944); Jones v. Lowman, 85 Ga. App. 743, 70 S.E.2d 122 (1952). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Neither a court of law nor a court of equity will lend its aid to either party to a contract founded upon illegal or immoral consideration. Rehak v. Mathis, 239 Ga. 541, 238 S.E.2d 81 (1977).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts will not enforce contracts outlawed by public policy and good morals.</b> - Aid of courts of justice cannot be invoked to enforce alleged rights which depend upon contracts outlawed by sound public policy and good morals. Glass v. Childs, 9 Ga. App. 520, 71 S.E. 920 (1911); Jones v. Crawford, 21 Ga. App. 29, 93 S.E. 515 (1917).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When parties to an illegal or immoral contract are in pari delicto, courts will not interpose,</b> but will leave parties where the courts find the parties. McAndrew v. Taylor, 15 Ga. App. 555, 83 S.E. 967 (1914).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts will not assist in recovery, under illegal contract, of property sold or its value.</b> Wright Co. v. Haralson, 52 Ga. App. 27, 182 S.E. 55 (1935).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Law will not enforce a contract, performance of which is made penal.</b> The crime is punished and the criminal must likewise lose the fruits of the illegal act. Lewis v. Brannen, 6 Ga. App. 419, 65 S.E. 189 (1909); Jones v. Bell Isle, 13 Ga. App. 437, 79 S.E. 357 (1913).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Courts may grant injunctions to prevent enforcement of illegal contract to injury of third parties.</b> - A court of equity will interpose by injunction to prevent members of illegal combination from enforcing an illegal agreement to the hurt and injury of one engaged in competitive business. Employing Printers' Club v. Doctor Blosser Co., 122 Ga. 509, 50 S.E. 353, 106 Am. St. R. 137, 69 L.R.A. 90, 2 Ann. Cas. 694 (1905).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Burden is on party attacking legality of a contract to show that the contract is illegal.</b> Gower v. Ozmer, 55 Ga. App. 81, 189 S.E. 540 (1936).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Criterion for determining whether contract is entire or severable.</b> - In determining whether a contract is entire or severable, the criterion is to be found in the question whether the whole quantity, service, or thing - all as a whole - is of the essence of the contract.

Roberts v. H. C. Whitmer Co., 46 Ga. App. 839, 169 S.E. 385 (1933); Scott v. Hall, 56 Ga. App. 467, 192 S.E. 920 (1937); Martell v. Atlanta Biltmore Hotel Corp., 114 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Agreement to purchase stock.</b> - Agreement which an investor concluded with a person who was employed by a company that offered to sell stock to the company's employees during an initial public offering, wherein the employee offered to purchase stock in the employee's own name for the investor, was illegal, and the trial court correctly ruled that the investor was not entitled to profits the investor lost because the employee did not buy the stock.

<p class="p4"><b>Contract as to reimbursement of medical services.</b> - Workers' compensation insurers/payors were not entitled to dismissal of a breach of contract claim by medical care providers as the claim provided fair notice of the allegations, and the contract rights did not violate any law or public policy with respect to assertions as to promised reimbursement rates for services provided.

<p class="p4"><b>Collection of tax issue moot.</b> - Trial court's reaching a determination that contracts were void was improper because the trial court was not called upon to decide whether various contracts were enforceable. However, because the injunction imposed by the court provided for the proper collection and remittance of a city's hotel occupancy taxes should online travel companies elect to continue to act as third-party tax collectors, the error was effectively moot and provided no basis for reversal.

<p class="p4"><b>Alleged illegal rebate provision was severable from an agency contract.</b> - Trial court properly denied a real estate firm's motion for summary judgment on the grounds of illegality of the agency contract because the alleged offending rebate provision was severable from the contract and, therefore, did not render the entire agency contract void and unenforceable.

During the 2010 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HR 178 (Ga. L. 2010, p. 1260), the constitutional amendment necessary for the statutory language of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga.

It has been suggested by certain parties that because of the effective date provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), there may be some question about the validity of that legislation. It is the intention of this Act to remove any such uncertainty by substantially reenacting the substantive provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), but the enactment of this Act should not be taken as evidence of a legislative determination that HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>1. What Contravenes Public Policy</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contracts obviously and directly tending to bring about results prohibited by law are void.</b> - Contracts that obviously and directly tend in a marked degree to bring about results that the law seeks to prevent cannot be made basis of a successful suit. Such contracts are against public policy. Orkin Exterminating Co. v. Dewberry, 204 Ga. 794, 51 S.E.2d 669 (1949), overruled on other grounds, Barry v. Stanco Communications Prods., Inc., 243 Ga. 68, 252 S.E.2d 491 (1979); Jones v. Faulkner, 101 Ga. App. 547, 114 S.E.2d 542 (1960).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Contracts against policy of the law are void and unenforceable even absent fraud in their procurement.</b> Glosser v. Powers, 209 Ga. 149, 71 S.E.2d 230 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When contract can be said to be contrary to public policy.</b> - Contract cannot be said to be contrary to public policy unless the General Assembly has declared it to be so, or unless consideration of the contract is contrary to good morals and contrary to law, or unless it is entered into for purpose of effecting an illegal or immoral agreement or doing something which is in violation of law. Porubiansky v. Emory Univ., 156 Ga. App. 602, 275 S.E.2d 163 (1980), aff'd, 248 Ga. 391, 282 S.E.2d 903 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

App. 602, 275 S.E.2d 163 (1980), aff'd, 248 Ga. 391, 282 S.E.2d 903 (1981).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State regulation did not contravene public policy.</b> - State revenue department's regulation concerning malt beverage distribution in Georgia did not conflict with the statute that prohibited contracts between private parties in restraint of trade because the regulation was a law authorized by statute, and was not a private contract.

<p class="p4"><b>Illegal consideration is promise, act, or forebearance contrary to law or public policy.</b> - An illegal consideration consists of any act or forbearance, or a promise to act or forbear, which is contrary to law or public policy. Hanley v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Ga. 585, 68 S.E.2d 581 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Contractual condition contrary to the health, safety, or welfare of others.</b> - When the performance of a contractual condition would be contrary to the health, safety, or welfare of others, the contract may be considered unenforceable. Tidwell Homes, Inc. v. Shedd Leasing Co., 191 Ga. App. 892, 383 S.E.2d 334 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Restriction on overnight guests in divorce agreement.</b> - Provision in a divorce agreement prohibiting either party from having unrelated overnight guests of the opposite gender while the parties' children were present was not overly broad or unduly burdensome, nor did the provision violate public policy, and a trial court did not err in enforcing the provision and finding the mother in contempt for the provision's violation. Norman v. Norman, 329 Ga. App. 502, 765 S.E.2d 677 (2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitation of liability clause in construction contract.</b> - In a negligence and breach of contractual warranty suit brought by a developer against an engineering firm for damages caused by the firm on a project involving the construction of an apartment complex, the trial court erred by granting the firm partial summary judgment and enforcing an indemnity clause in the contract that limited the firm's liability to the firm's fee. The limitation of liability clause violated public policy under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-8-2(b) since the clause contained language that applied to "any and all claims" by third parties and shifted all liability above the fee for services to the developer, no matter the origin of the claim or who was at fault.

<p class="p4"><b>When employee agreed to a deduction from the employee's paycheck to cover the cost of workers' compensation insurance,</b> the agreement would be contrary to law and to public policy, and would, therefore, be unenforceable. Morgan S., Inc. v. Lee, 190 Ga. App. 410, 379 S.E.2d 219 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>An attorney's promise to secure an inmate's release from prison</b> regardless of the legality of the inmate's conviction and sentence was not enforceable and could not serve as the basis for a fraud action. Hamm v. Auld, 192 Ga. App. 717, 386 S.E.2d 385, cert. denied, 192 Ga. App. 902, 386 S.E.2d 385 (1989).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mother's agreement to surrender child for benefit under will contravenes public policy.</b> - Agreement by mother to surrender possession of her infant child in order to receive a benefit for herself and her other children under a will was void as being against public policy. Hanley v. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Ga. 585, 68 S.E.2d 581 (1952).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Provision prohibiting borrower from incurring additional debt without lender's consent while loan remains unpaid is valid.</b> - Contract provision which prohibits the borrower from incurring additional debt for business operations without the consent of the lender while the loan is still unpaid is not an unreasonable restraint on trade because it protects the legitimate rights of the lender by promoting solvency of borrower. Interstate Sec. Police, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Emory Bank, 237 Ga. 37, 226 S.E.2d 583 (1976).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Brandon v. Newman, 243 Ga. App. 183, 532 S.E.2d 743 (2000).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Attorney fee arrangements.</b> - Because the interest in a fee award held by appellee, a law firm's former attorney, existed prior to the law firm's later assignment of its interest to appellant assignee, and the attorney's interest could not have been assigned by the firm as it belonged to the attorney personally, the attorney had an enforceable contractual interest in the attorney's percentage and the attorney was protected by O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 15-19-14's attorney lien; the attorney had already sold the attorney's shares in the law firm and had entered into an attorney-client relationship with the class action plaintiffs before the law firm was associated with the class action and before the law firm assigned the firm's interest in the fees to the assignee, and the fact that the case involved an attorney-client relationship did not mean that the Georgia Disciplinary Standards and the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct preempted O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-8-2(a) as to public policy and case law that parties were free to contract about any subject matter, on any terms, unless prohibited by statute or public policy, and injury to public interest clearly appeared.

</p>

<p class="p4"><b>Considerations for court.</b> - In determining whether or not a restraint of trade is reasonable, a court should consider whether it is such only as to afford a fair protection to interest of party in favor of whom it is given, and not so large as to interfere with interest of public. Whatever restraint is larger than necessary for protection of the party can be of no benefit to either; it can only be oppressive and if oppressive, it is in the eye of the law unreasonable. Whatever is injurious to interest of the public is void, on grounds of public policy. Rakestraw v. Lanier, 104 Ga. 188, 30 S.E. 735, 69 Am. St. R. 154 (1898); Shirk v. Loftis Bros. &amp; Co., 148 Ga. 500, 97 S.E. 66 (1918). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">If considered with reference to situation, business and objects of parties, and in light of all surrounding circumstances with reference to which contract was made, a restraint contracted for appears to have been for a just and honest purpose, for protection of legitimate interests of party in whose favor it is imposed, reasonable as between them, and not specially injurious to the public, such restraint will be held valid. Scott v. Hall, 56 Ga. App. 467, 192 S.E. 920 (1937); Turner v. Robinson, 214 Ga. 729, 107 S.E.2d 648 (1959); Spalding v.

Emory Bank, 237 Ga. 37, 226 S.E.2d 583 (1976). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In determination of whether limitations in contract restraining trade are reasonable, a court will consider nature and extent of trade or business, situation of parties, and all other circumstances. To be valid, a covenant must be reasonably necessary to protect interest of party in whose favor it is imposed, and must not unduly prejudice interest of the public. The restrictions imposed upon promisor must not be larger than are necessary for protection of promisee. Orkin Exterminating Co. v. Dewberry, 204 Ga. 794, 51 S.E.2d 669 (1949), overruled on other grounds, Barry v.

<p class="p4">Under the law of Georgia, covenants in restraint of trade may be enforced if the covenants are reasonable as to time and place and are not overly broad as to activities proscribed, taking into consideration interests of individuals in gaining and pursuing a livelihood, of commercial concerns in protecting property, confidential information and relationships, good will and economic advantage, and of broader public policy favoring individual freedom to enter into contracts and to contract as one will.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Prerequisites before enforcement of noncompetition provisions.</b> - Under the law of Georgia, there are three prerequisites which must be met before noncompetition provisions in contracts may be enforced without contravening public policy. These prerequisites are that the provision: (1) must be reasonable as to time of restraint; (2) must be definite and reasonable as to territorial extent of duty owed not to compete; and (3) must be definite and reasonable as to nature of business activities proscribed.

<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between restraints on practice of profession and restraints connected with sale of business.</b> - A distinction exists between that class of contracts binding one to desist from practice of a learned profession, and those which bind one who has sold out a mercantile or other kind of business, and the good will therewith connected, not to again engage in that business. In the former class there should be a reasonable limit as to time, so as to prevent contract from operating with unnecessary harshness against person who is to abstain from practicing one's profession at a time when one so doing could in no way benefit the other contracting party. In the latter class such limit is not essential to validity of the contract, but the restraint may be indefinite. Kutash v. Gluckman, 193 Ga. 805, 20 S.E.2d 128 (1942); Burdine v.

<p class="p4"><b>Contract restraining trade upheld when based upon consideration making it reasonable for parties to do so.</b> - Contract in restraint of trade, upon a consideration which shows contract was reasonable for parties to enter it, is good.

<p class="p4">In covenants against competition in employment contracts, if the restraint contracted for appears to have been for a just and honest purpose, for the protection of the legitimate interests of the party in whose favor the restraint is imposed, reasonable as between the parties, and not specially injurious to the public, the restraint will be held valid.

<p class="p4">Although restrictive covenants are not favored in law, when the contract is not unreasonable or overbroad and there is strong evidence of and necessity for some protection of employer's expectations from those to whom the employer's affairs are entrusted, restrictive covenants will not be held against public policy.

<p class="p4"><b>When one party leased the party's equipment to the other</b> on a long-term basis, the facts were more closely analogous to the covenant not to compete which were ancillary to a franchise or distributorship agreement than the sale of business' assets. Thus, the alleged noncompetition agreement between the parties, even if found to be a binding contract, were unenforceable under Georgia law when the terms of the agreement were not definite or strictly limited in time and territorial effect.

<p class="p4"><b>If one covenant is void, then all such covenants in same contract are void.</b> - If any covenant not to compete, within a given employment contract, is unreasonable either in time, territory, or prohibited business activity, then all covenants not to compete within the same employment contract are unenforceable.

<p class="p4">A nonsolicitation clause ancillary to an employment agreement was overbroad and unenforceable because the clause did not limit the prohibition to only customers with whom the employee had contact, and lacked a territorial restriction; thus, a noncompetition clause was likewise unenforceable as Georgia did not employ the "blue pencil" doctrine of severability.

<p class="p4"><b>Reasonableness of territorial limitation.</b> - Territorial coverage restriction in a covenant not to compete was overbroad where the 80 mile radius stated in the covenant related to the area in which the employer, rather than the employee, did business and the employer could not show a legitimate business interest for the restriction.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What constitutes a champertous contract.</b> - There are two essential elements of a champertous agreement: first, there must be undertaking by one person to defray expense of whole or part of another's suit; second, agreement or promise on part of latter to divide with former proceeds of litigation in event the litigation proves successful. Anderson v. Anderson, 12 Ga. App. 706, 78 S.E. 271 (1913); Clark v. Harrison, 182 Ga. 56, 184 S.E. 620 (1936). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Such a contract is unenforceable between parties. Brown &amp; Huseby, Inc. v. Chrietzberg, 242 Ga. 232, 248 S.E.2d 631 (1978).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4">Ga.

L. 2009, p. 231), which was a bill that dealt with the issue of restrictive covenants in contracts and which was contingently effective on the passage of a constitutional amendment. During the 2010 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HR 178 (Ga. L. 2010, p. 1260), the constitutional amendment necessary for the statutory language of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), and the voters ratified the constitutional amendment on November 2, 2010. It has been suggested by certain parties that because of the effective date provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), there may be some question about the validity of that legislation. It is the intention of this Act to remove any such uncertainty by substantially reenacting the substantive provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), but the enactment of this Act should not be taken as evidence of a legislative determination that HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231) was in fact invalid." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It has been suggested by certain parties that because of the effective date provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), there may be some question about the validity of that legislation. It is the intention of this Act to remove any such uncertainty by substantially reenacting the substantive provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), but the enactment of this Act should not be taken as evidence of a legislative determination that HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Enforcement of covenants would be against Georgia law and public policy.</b> - Trial court did not err by refusing to enforce the forum selection and choice of law clauses requiring Texas law to govern an employment contract and by dismissing the complaint because a Texas court applying Texas law would enforce non-compete covenants that were unenforceable under applicable Georgia law and public policy.

<p class="p4">In a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration as to the enforceability of non-compete clauses in an employment contract, the trial court properly granted the competitor judgment on the pleadings because the trial court correctly found that the pleadings showed that the lack of any limit on the scope of the restricted work or the solicitation of former customers were void and unenforceable under the non-severability rule as a matter of law. Lapolla Indus. v. Hess, 325 Ga. App. 256, 750 S.E.2d 467 (2013). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Trial court did not err in refusing to enforce a choice of law provision in the 2014 agreement containing restrictive covenants and by applying Georgia law rather than Delaware law because a choice of law provision would not be enforced if application of the clause contravened a strong public policy of Georgia; before the enactment of the restrictive covenants act, restrictive covenants in restraint of trade fell within that public policy exception if (1) at least one of the restrictive covenants violated Georgia public policy and (2) such a covenant would likely be enforced by the other state's court; and the act did not change the prior conclusion that unreasonable restrictive covenants were against Georgia public policy.

No express reference to geographic area or the types of products or services considered to be competitive shall be required in order for the restraint to be enforceable.

The phrase "the territory where the employee is working at the time of termination" or similar language shall be considered sufficient as a description of geographic areas if the person or entity bound by the restraint can reasonably determine the maximum reasonable scope of the restraint at the time of termination. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Performance bond cannot be considered to have the force and effect of a payment bond.</b> See B &amp; B Elec. Supply Co. v. H.J. Russell Constr. Co., 166 Ga. App. 499, 304 S.E.2d 544 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of bonds for public contracts.</b> - As compared with private bonds, statutory bonds for public contracts are liberally construed to effectuate the intent of the statute. The presumption under a statutory bond is that the intention of the parties was to execute a bond in accordance with the aims of the statute. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security under liens and bonds compared.</b> - Under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-361, the lien on the property is the security for the laborer and the materialman, while under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1, when no lien can be secured, the bond is the security. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Incorporation of statutory conditions into bond.</b> - When construing a public contractor's statutory payment bond, courts are mindful of the special legislative policy considerations underpinning the statute, and often incorporate the statutory conditions into the bond. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conditions precedent to action on bond.</b> - Breach of the condition or promise may be viewed as a condition precedent to an action on the bond. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Liability of county.</b> - Provision that no contract with the county is valid unless the contractor gives a payment bond with good and sufficient surety does not purport to impose any duty or liability upon a county. DeKalb County v. J &amp; A Pipeline Co., 263 Ga. 645, 437 S.E.2d 327 (1993) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>County complying with statutory requirements not liable to subcontractor.</b> - When a county board of education obtained a payment bond from a general contractor in compliance with statutory requirements, the board could not be held liable for subcontractor's claim for payment for work performed under the board's construction contract with the general contractor. ABE Eng'g, Inc. v. Fulton County Bd. of Educ., 214 Ga. App. 514, 448 S.E.2d 221 (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p6"><b>1. In General</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment bond will be strictly construed and will not be extended by implication</b> or interpretation. Thus, a bond guaranteeing payment only to the public body and not to all parties furnishing services or supplies under the contract does not meet the statutory requirement of a payment bond. B &amp; B Elec. Supply Co. v. H.J. Russell Constr. Co., 166 Ga. App. 499, 304 S.E.2d 544 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bond must have required terms to be enforceable as payment bond.</b> - To satisfy the statutory purpose of a payment bond, a payment bond for public work must include the specific statement that the bond is intended for all persons furnishing work or material for the public improvement or that the contract is to be construed so as to be in accordance with applicable statutes. In the absence of one of these terms, a bond is not a "payment" bond and is not enforceable as such by a subcontractor or the subcontractor's materialmen. The materialman's remedy in such a case appears to be against the public body. B &amp; B Elec. Supply Co. v. H.J. Russell Constr. Co., 166 Ga. App. 499, 304 S.E.2d 544 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Construction of terminology not uniform for all remedies afforded materialmen.</b> - Remedies afforded a particular materialman under (1) O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-361, (2) former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1, and (3) the contractual rights appurtenant to a private payment bond are distinct and separate, and, even though certain terminology may overlap, the judicial construction of that terminology is not uniform for all remedies. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Effect of definition of claimant under the bond on rights of materialmen.</b> - If the general contractor's payment bond defines a claimant under the bond as one supplying material to a subcontractor, then a materialman of a subcontractor may sue on the bond for the subcontractor's nonpayment; if the bond expressly limits a right of action on the bond to the named obligees or is conditioned on the general contractor's payment of only materialmen having a direct relationship with the general contractor, then a materialman of a subcontractor may not sue on the payment bond; and if the bond is conditioned on the general contractor's payment of all persons furnishing labor and material under or for the contract, then, at a minimum, materialmen of the general contractor may maintain an action on the bond. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Right of action on bond.</b> - Although the term "materials," as judicially interpreted, may exclude certain items as nonlienable, the word may very well include the same items for purposes of a separate statute, such as former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1. Clearly, then, the lack of a right of action to enforce a special lien under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 44-14-361, as statutorily provided or judicially discerned, does not, of itself, preclude a beneficiary's right to sue on a statutory payment bond, or by analogy, on a private payment bond. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Third party may not sue on performance bond.</b> - When a performance bond was executed to guarantee the completion of work under a public contract, a private person not a party to the contract could not collect damages for flooding and loss of business resulting from nonperformance of the contract because the private person was not a party to the contract and was not protected by the bond. Long v. City of Midway, 169 Ga. App. 72, 311 S.E.2d 508 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cause of action on payment bond provided.</b> - Former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 36-82-104 provides that there is a cause of action to every person entitled to the protection of a "payment" bond required to be obtained by the prime contractor and former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 requires a payment bond to be obtained, made payable to the public body for which the work was to be done, and for the use and protection of subcontractors supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work on the public project. B &amp; B Elec. Supply Co. v. H.J. Russell Constr. Co., 166 Ga. App. 499, 304 S.E.2d 544 (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Name in which action on bond brought.</b> - Materialmen having a beneficial interest in a contractor's bond may bring an action on the bond in the materialmen's own name rather than in the name of the nominal obligee. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Materialman has burden of proving lien</b> and must bring oneself clearly within the law. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Underground Atlanta is a public works.</b> - Because Underground Atlanta is a public works project, the city was required to obtain payment and performance bonds for the Underground Atlanta project. To require such bonds for only one portion of the project is not sufficient to discharge the city's obligation under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1. City of Atlanta v. United Elec. Co., 202 Ga. App. 239, 414 S.E.2d 251 (1991) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">County had a duty to require a contractor to procure a payment bond which was not procured; thus, a subcontractor had a right to sue the county for materials furnished because of the county's failure to require the payment bond. Kelly Energy Sys. v. Board of Comm'rs,, 196 Ga. App. 519, 396 S.E.2d 498, cert. denied, 196 Ga.

<p class="p4"><b>Claim including obligations to third tier subcontractors.</b> - Sub-subcontractor who provided goods and services for a public works contract could include in the sub-subcontractor's claim against the payment bond the amounts which the sub-subcontractor was contractually obligated to pay the sub-subcontractors third tier subcontractors. Sunderland v. Vertex Assocs., 199 Ga. App. 278, 404 S.E.2d 574 (1990), cert. denied, 199 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>2. Applicability</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Supplier of materials to subcontractor protected.</b> - When the general contractor on a government construction contract subcontracted the procurement of certain materials to a subcontractor, which in turn purchased the materials from plaintiff supplier, the plaintiff was not too remote a supplier to recover under the general contractor's statutory payment bond. Barton Malow Co. v. Metro Mfg., Inc., 214 Ga.

<p class="p6"><b>3. Machinery and Equipment Costs Recoverable</b></p>
<p class="p10"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cost of repairs "consumed" in performing work is recoverable.</b> - Repair costs are recoverable under a statutory surety bond if the repairs were "consumed" in the prosecution of the work covered by the bond, in the sense that the repairs specially contributed to the pending work only and were not of particular use in other unrelated work. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Rental value of machinery is properly considered within protection of bond.</b> - Rental value of machinery owing to a lessor materialman of a subcontractor is properly considered an item within the intended protection of the surety's promise, required by the obligees, to pay all persons furnishing materials consumed in the general contract. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 514 F. Supp. 1033 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 30 (11th Cir. 1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-10-1 prior to its 2001 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Distinction between those equipment and machinery costs covered by bond and those excluded from coverage.</b> - Determinative distinction is between items going into work, or specially contributing to its execution and nothing else, and those properly chargeable to plant and equipment of contractor and available not only for pending work but for other work as well.

<p class="p4">While there may be a recovery on a public contractor's bond for material and labor used in incidental and current repairs to the contractor's machinery, there can be none for major repairs involving the replacement of old with new parts, in the absence of proof that the new parts were consumed in the work covered by the bond. The determinative distinction is between the items going into the work, or specially contributing to the execution of the contract and nothing else, and those properly chargeable to the plant and equipment of the contractor, and available not only for the pending work but for other work as well.

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence supported award.</b> - An award of attorney fees entered against a home builder, pursuant to both O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§§</span> 13-6-11 and 13-11-8, was upheld on appeal because an award pursuant to the latter statute did not require a finding of bad faith, and evidence of the home builder's stubborn litigiousness and the unnecessary trouble and expense the home builder caused the two contractors supported an award under the former statute. Hampshire Homes, Inc. v. Espinosa Constr. Servs., 288 Ga. App. 718, 655 S.E.2d 316 (2007).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Award of attorney's fees properly denied since contract related to single residence.</b> - Trial court properly denied attorney fees to a contractor in a breach of contract suit brought under the Georgia Prompt Pay Act, O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-11-1 et seq., against a homeowner for the failure of the homeowner to pay for the installation of a wrought iron fence as O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-11-10 specifically provided that the Act did not apply to contracts involving single family residences and no evidence to support a bad faith litigation award was made.

<p class="p4"><b>Award of attorney's fees properly denied in a maritime contract case.</b> - American rule barring the shifting of attorneys' fees was a feature of maritime law and O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-11-8 of the Georgia Prompt Payment Act (GPPA), O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 13-11-1 et seq., was in direct conflict with that principle; thus, defendant subcontractor, a prevailing party in a suit involving a maritime contract (a dredging contract), was not entitled to fees. Further, a clearly established exception existed wherein the subcontractor was free to contract for the indemnification of attorneys' fees but chose not to include such a provision in the contract.
