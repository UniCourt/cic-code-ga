<p class="p8">(A) Oversight <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.

<p class="p8">(3) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(B) Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">(3) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">(D) Enforcement <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">(2) By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">Section 14. Date of Implementation of the Interstate Commission for EMS Personnel Practice and Associated Rules, Withdrawal, and Amendment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(B) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(C) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">(D) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p5">"EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p8">The contracting states solemnly agree that:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p5">ARTICLE I - PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p8">This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term "states" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p5">ARTICLE II - GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p8">On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p5">ARTICLE III - PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>

<p class="p8">(1) Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) Review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(4) Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(5) Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within 30 days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(1) A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as but not limited to fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(2) The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(3) The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p5">ARTICLE IV - LIMITATIONS <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>

To better prepare for responding to disasters, criminal acts, and acts of terrorism, the General Assembly intends to create a state-wide first responder building mapping information system that will provide first responders with information they need to be successful when disaster strikes. The first responder building mapping information system shall be developed for this limited and specific purpose and does not impose standards or system requirements on any other mapping systems used for any other purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

A good faith attempt by a service supplier to comply with any such audit shall serve as a defense to a claim of failure to comply in any contested proceeding under Code Section 50-13-13 or judicial review under Code Section 50-13-19, and if upheld, there shall be no civil penalty. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of this exempting provision</b> is not to give to the Confederate War pensioner any lien or priority of payment for money deposited in a bank, but to protect the pensioner against garnishment or other legal process sued out by the pensioner's creditor to enforce a debt due by the pensioner to the creditor. Mobley v. Jackson, 171 Ga. 434, 156 S.E. 23 (1930) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 78-218).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Continuing duty to pay pension.</b> - After a pensioner has once been enrolled, there is a duty to continue to pay the pension to the enrolled pensioner until there is notice of the pensioner's death, provided the pensioner continues residence in this state. 1945-47 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 468.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Presupposition of residence for pension and admission eligibility.</b> - Eligibility for a pension and admission to the confederate home presupposes residence at the time of the passage of Ga. L. 1947, p. 1143. 1948-49 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 289.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Residence status matter of intent.</b> - Fact that pensioner is outside state boundaries does not mean that the pensioner is not a resident of Georgia. Under the law of this state, residence is largely a matter of intent which may be inferred from a number of circumstances and facts. It is frequently true that an aged pensioner makes protracted visits to children in other states, but if it is the intention of the pensioner to ultimately return to this state, the pensioner would be entitled to continue to receive the pensioner's Georgia pension, and the pension regulations in such cases should be liberally construed so as to give deserving pensioners every benefit of the law and facts in connection with their right to receive pensions. 1945-47 Op.
