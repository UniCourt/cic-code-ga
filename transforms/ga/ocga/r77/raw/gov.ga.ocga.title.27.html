<p class="p4"><b>Former definition of "hunting" as written was vague and overbroad.</b> - The word "pursuing" is intended by the legislature to mean seeking or searching for wildlife for the purpose of shooting or capturing such wildlife. The words "disturbing, harrying, or worrying" are intended to be limited to situations where the activities are for the purpose of shooting or capturing such wildlife. Shirley v. State, 254 Ga. 723, 334 S.E.2d 154 (1985) (decided prior to 1986 amendment).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Activities constituting "hunting."</b> - In a prosecution for hunting over a baited field, evidence was sufficient to show defendant was "hunting" where defendant's activities constituted placing, setting, drawing, or using a device to take wildlife, whether or not defendant was actually in the act of pursuing, shooting, killing, or taking deer at the time of apprehension.

<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly recognizes that hunting and fishing and the taking of wildlife are a valued part of the cultural heritage of the State of Georgia. The General Assembly further recognizes that such activities play an essential role in the state's economy and in funding the state's management programs for game and nongame species alike, and that such activities have also come to play an important and sometimes critical role in the biological management of certain natural communities within this state. In recognition of this cultural heritage and the tradition of stewardship it embodies, and of the important role that hunting and fishing and the taking of wildlife play in the state's economy and in the preservation and management of the state's natural communities, the General Assembly declares that Georgia citizens have the right to take fish and wildlife, subject to the laws and regulations adopted by the board for the public good and general welfare, which laws and regulations should be vigorously enforced. The General Assembly further declares that the state's wildlife resources should be managed in accordance with sound principles of wildlife management, using all appropriate tools, including hunting, fishing, and the taking of wildlife. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Wildlife is held in trust by the state for the benefit of its citizens and shall not be reduced to private ownership except as specifically provided for in this title. All wildlife of the State of Georgia is declared to be within the custody of the department for purposes of management and regulation in accordance with this title. However, the State of Georgia, the department, and the board shall be immune from suit and shall not be liable for any damage to life, person, or property caused directly or indirectly by any wildlife. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(2) The department has the authority and the responsibility to work with cooperating sportsmen, conservation groups, and others to encourage participation in hunting and fishing at a level to ensure continuation of such activities in perpetuity and no net loss of hunting and fishing opportunity on state owned lands. Further, the department is authorized to promote and encourage hunting, fishing, and other wildlife associated recreation on state managed wildlife areas, public fishing areas, federally owned or managed forests, and other suitable public and private lands of this state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Any person who hunts, traps, fishes, possesses, or transports wildlife in violation of the wildlife laws and regulations violates the conditions under which this right is extended; and any wildlife then on his person or within his immediate possession is deemed to be wildlife possessed in violation of the law and is subject to seizure by the department pursuant to Code Section 27-1-21.

<p class="p10">(1) Any person who violates any provisions of this title or any regulations or orders promulgated and administered thereunder shall be liable civilly for a penalty in an amount of up to $1,000.00 for each and every violation thereof, the penalty to be recoverable by a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner by the district attorney of the county in which the alleged violator resides. The commissioner on his motion may or upon complaint of any interested party charging a violation shall refer the matter directly to the district attorney of the county in which the alleged violator resides. The proceeds from all civil penalties arising from enforcement of the wildlife laws, regulations, and orders pursuant to this Code section shall be used in the manner prescribed in Code Section 27-1-14; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Whenever the commissioner determines that any person has violated any provision of this title or any regulations or orders promulgated under this title, the commissioner may issue an administrative order imposing a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 for the violation. Any person who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any such order shall, upon petition within 30 days after the issuance of such order, have a right to a hearing before an administrative law judge appointed by the Board of Natural Resources. The hearing before the administrative law judge shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," and the rules and regulations adopted by the board pursuant thereto. The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute the final decision of the board and any party to the hearing, including the commissioner, shall have the right of judicial review thereof in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) All civil penalties recovered by the department as provided in this Code section shall be paid into the state treasury. The commissioner may file in the superior court in the county in which the person under order resides or, if the person is a corporation, in the county in which the corporation maintains its principal place of business, or in the county in which the violation occurred, a certified copy of a final order of the commissioner or the administrative law judge unappealed from or of a final order of the administrative law judge affirmed upon appeal, whereupon the court shall render judgment in accordance therewith and notify the parties. The judgment shall have the same effect, and all proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same, as though the judgment had been rendered in an action duly heard and determined by the court. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><b>Incorrect date on summons.</b> - Because the date of the alleged offense is not generally material, except for statute of limitations purposes, and failure to rely on a specific date is not harmful unless the defendant is surprised and prejudiced in the preparation of defendant's defense, defendant was not harmed by the appearance of an incorrect date on the summons.

<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to sustain conviction.</b> - Evidence that defendant obtained resident hunting licenses by giving a Georgia address as defendant's legal residence, while a resident of the State of Virginia, evidence of the act of hunting and testimony that defendant had been hunting and had taken a turkey was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 27-2-1.

<p class="p4">Because the defendant acknowledged hunting doves in an open field without a hunting license and "fading" into the woods when the rangers approached, the rangers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity had occurred; consequently, defendant's fourth amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure were not violated and the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial on the charges of illegal hunting and obstruction.

<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The General Assembly has heretofore found and declared that hunting is a privilege to be exercised only in accordance with the law granting such privilege. The General Assembly now specifically finds and declares that while the act of hunting is an enjoyable and beneficial form of recreation, it can be dangerous not only to the hunter himself but also to other persons if due care is not exercised. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that all persons who refuse or fail to exercise such due care may have their hunting privileges suspended as provided in this Code section. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

If the commissioner determines culpable negligence on the part of the person causing the death or injury and that such negligence was the proximate cause of such death or injury, the commissioner may suspend that person's hunting privileges for a specified period of time not to exceed ten years. Any such determination to suspend shall be subject to review as provided for in this Code section. When the commissioner shall decide to suspend said person's hunting privileges, the commissioner must notify such person of said suspension and of his right to a hearing to contest the commissioner's determination. The notification from the commissioner to the person whose license is being suspended shall be by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery with return receipt requested; or, in lieu thereof, notice may be given by personal service upon such person. Upon such notice, any such hunting privileges shall be revoked by such notice and such person shall surrender his or her hunting license, if any, to the department within ten days of such notification. For the purposes of this article, notice given by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery with return receipt requested mailed to the person's last known address shall be prima-facie evidence that such person received the required notice. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

If, following the administrative hearing, there is a determination that such person was negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the death or injury, the hunting privileges of such person may be suspended for a period of up to ten years. The period of time that such privileges are suspended shall be commensurate with the degree of negligence and the severity of the injury. If there is a determination of no negligence or that the negligence was not the proximate cause of the death or injury, the person's hunting privileges shall be restored.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p7">"WILDLIFE VIOLATOR COMPACT <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p7">ARTICLE I <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p7">FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY, AND PURPOSE <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p10">(a)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The party states find that: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(A) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(B) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(C) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(10) The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the policy of the party states to: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges or rights of any person whose license privileges or rights have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose of this compact is to: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Such permission shall not be required, however, if the person hunting or a member of the person's family is the owner of the land, the lessee of the land, or the lessee of the game rights of the land. For the purposes of this Code section only, "family" means mother, father, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, niece, nephew, grandson, granddaughter, grandmother, grandfather, or spouse. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(c) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any person who violates subsection (a) or (b) of this Code section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $500.00. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Any person who violates subsection (a) or (b) of this Code section for the second time within a two-year period shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000.00; and the department shall revoke the right of such person to a hunting license for a period of one year for each such second conviction within a two-year period. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><b>JUDICIAL DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Permission of landowner.</b> - One must have permission of landowner as condition precedent to hunting any game or animals. Blassingame v. State, 11 Ga. App. 809, 76 S.E. 392 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conviction for hunting without permission.</b> - In order to convict person of hunting on land of another without permission, it is incumbent upon the state to prove that permission to hunt was not obtained from the landowner, lessee, or lessee of the game rights, and where the state proved only that the defendant did not obtain permission from one of the owners, and there was no showing that the owner was the only person empowered to give permission to hunt on the land, the evidence was insufficient for a rational jury to reasonably find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Townsend v. State, 173 Ga. App. 389, 326 S.E.2d 569 (1985).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Protected status of game being hunted has no effect.</b> - Former Ga. L. 1911, p. 137, <span class="s1">§</span> 7 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 27-3-1) expressly protected lands of another from trespassing by hunters regardless of whether the game being hunted was specifically protected by that section. Blassingame v. State, 11 Ga. App. 809, 76 S.E. 392 (1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The state must negate the disjunction</b> that the landowner or the lessee or the lessee of the game rights gave permission to hunt on the land, which requires a showing that the landowner did not give permission, the lessee (if extant) did not give permission, and the lessee of the game rights (if extant) did not give permission. Burkhalter v. State, 256 Ga. 236, 347 S.E.2d 588 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence sufficient to sustain conviction.</b> - See Blackwelder v. State, 256 Ga. 283, 347 S.E.2d 600 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Evidence insufficient to support conviction.</b> - Where the lessee of the game rights had not given the defendants permission to hunt on the property, there was no evidence that another lessee existed and the only other evidence was one defendant's testimony that they had not intended to hunt on private property because they did not have the appropriate hunting license to hunt on such property, this evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 27-3-1. Burkhalter v. State, 256 Ga. 236, 347 S.E.2d 588 (1986).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Incorrect date on summons.</b> - Because the date of the alleged offense is not generally material, except for statute of limitations purposes, and failure to rely on a specific date is not harmful unless the defendant is surprised and prejudiced in the preparation of a defense, defendant was not harmed by the appearance of an incorrect date on the summons.

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Hunting "wildlife" from motor vehicle.</b> - An accusation alleging that the defendants "did with force of arms unlawfully hunt, chase, or kill wildlife from a motor vehicle" was deficient, since one may admit to hunting wildlife from a motor vehicle and still be innocent of criminal activity. Manley v. State, 187 Ga. App. 773, 371 S.E.2d 438, cert. denied, 187 Ga. App. 908, 371 S.E.2d 438 (1988) (decided prior to the 1992 amendment, which substituted "wildlife or feral hog" for "game bird, game animal, or fur-bearing animal" in subsection (a)). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">When defendants turned their truck around and went back to shoot a deer in a field, they were "pursuing" the deer upon a public highway from a motor vehicle; therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support their guilty verdict. Passmore v. State, 253 Ga. App. 901, 561 S.E.2d 123 (2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conviction for separate offenses.</b> - Where defendants hunted from a motor vehicle on a public road at night using a light exceeding six volts, it was not error to convict them of the three separate crimes of hunting at night, hunting on a public road, and hunting from a motor vehicle. Sanford v. State, 169 Ga. App. 769, 315 S.E.2d 281 (1984).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">(1) Post a cash forfeiture bond in the form prescribed by the board in favor of the State of Georgia in the amount of $5,000.00, conditioned upon faithful compliance with Code Section 27-4-133; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) File with the commissioner a forfeiture bond in the form prescribed by the board executed by a bonding, surety, or insurance company licensed to do business in this state in favor of the state in the amount of $5,000.00, conditioned upon faithful compliance with Code Section 27-4-133; or <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) File with the commissioner an affidavit in the form prescribed by the board stating that the affiant is a resident of the State of Georgia, that he is the sole owner of the boat to be licensed, and that the boat is free from all encumbrances, including but not limited to liens, mortgages, and other evidences of security interests. The department may require proof of residence or ownership or proof of residence and ownership. The affidavit shall acknowledge that the boat sought to be licensed will be subject to Code Section 27-4-137. The affidavit shall be filed by the department in the office of the clerk of the superior court as follows: when the owner is an individual, then in the county where he resides; when the owner is a partnership, corporation, or business entity other than an individual, then in the county of the owner's principal place of business. The affidavit shall be filed by the clerk like other security interests on boats; provided, however, that the filing of such affidavit shall not be permissible where the boat is documented under the laws of the United States. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The term of the bond provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section shall be for one year and shall correspond to the period of the license. When such a bond has been filed, Code Section 27-4-137 shall not apply to the boat covered by the bond. The commissioner shall have the right to recover on the bond for the breach of its conditions whenever said boat is used in violation of Code Section 27-4-133 or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, either with or without the knowledge, consent, or acquiescence of the owner of the boat. The recovery shall be: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(1) For the first violation, $1,000.00; and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) For each subsequent violation within the period of any license, $4,000.00. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

However, in the event that the total amount of any bond is forfeited, the commercial fishing boat license shall be suspended until a new bond in the amount of $10,000.00 is filed covering the remainder of the period of the license. Until the new bond is filed, any commercial use of the boat shall be unlawful; and the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed so as to alter or affect the seizure and civil forfeiture, under Code Section 27-4-137, of any boat not covered by the bonds provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p10">The General Assembly finds that the wild harvest and mariculture of shellfish provide increased seafood production and long-term economic opportunities for coastal Georgia as well as increased ecological benefits to the estuarine environment by promoting natural water filtration and increased fishery habitats. The General Assembly also finds that there exists a public health concern when consuming raw or undercooked shellfish, especially during warm water, summer conditions. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that it is the policy of the state to encourage development of the commercial shellfish industry in ways that protect the public health and are compatible with the environment and with other public uses of the estuarine area, such as navigation, fishing, swimming, and other forms of recreation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

Any person desiring to lease state intertidal water bottoms shall make an application in writing to the department in the manner and time as described by the department in the competitive bid advertisement. Such lease shall include terms and conditions as prescribed by the department. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Prior to such advertisement, the department shall prepare a proposed form of lease and appropriate instructions which shall be available to prospective bidders under such conditions as the department may prescribe. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the department, and each bid shall be accompanied by a refundable certified check, cashier's check, or money order for the total annual amount of the submitted bid. The funds submitted by the successful bidder will be applied toward the first annual lease payment. In addition, each sealed bid shall be accompanied by a detailed management plan for working the intertidal water bottoms lease area for wild harvest or mariculture. The lease form shall contain provisions regarding the term of the lease, the method of taking shellfish, the time and place for annual payment for the lease which shall be equal to the bid amount, the minimum replanting or production requirements of shellfish to be harvested, the placement and type of signs to mark the site as a leased area, and such other terms as the department deems necessary. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(3) All bids shall be opened in public on the date and at the time and place specified in the advertisement of the invitation to bid. The department shall announce which bid and bidder it considers most advantageous to the state. In so considering, the department shall give preference to residents over nonresidents. In exercising its discretion, the department may consider an applicant's previous performance and compliance with this article. The department shall have the right to reject any or all bids and bidders and the right to waive formalities in bidding. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(b) (1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The department may offer leases of state subtidal water bottoms within approved growing areas for the exclusive rights to mariculture shellfish to in-state and out-of-state residents. Prior to offering a subtidal water bottoms lease, the department shall consider compatibility with other public uses of the marine and estuarine resources in proximity of the lease area that include, but are not limited to, navigation, fishing, swimming, and other forms of recreation. Such lease shall include terms and conditions as the department may prescribe. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(2) Subtidal water bottoms leases shall be issued through a lottery devised and operated by the department. Preference may be given to certified firms, lease holders, and state residents. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">(2) Intertidal water bottoms and subtidal water bottoms leases may be inheritable and transferable to the leasee's spouse, siblings, lineal descendants, or lineal ancestors without payment of a transfer fee if the leasee dies or is permanently and totally disabled. An instrument of the court declaring the rightful heir or recipient may be required for transfers upon a death. For purposes of this Code section, a permanent, total disability shall be a physical or mental impairment of a total and permanent nature which prevents gainful employment and which is certified as such by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, Medicaid, medicare, the Railroad Retirement System, or a unit of federal, state, or local government recognized by the board by rule or regulation. Inherited leases shall be valid only with approval of the department. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A transferee shall assume the lease in its entirety and all conditions associated with the lease, acquire all additional authorizations if so required, and harvest shellfish on such lease as evidenced by harvest records within two years after such transfer or the lease may revert to the department. Any person receiving a shellfish water bottoms or subtidal water bottoms lease by transfer shall pay to the department the lease fee within 30 days following the date of the transfer. If such fee is not paid within the required time, the lease shall revert to the department. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
