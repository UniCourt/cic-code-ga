The owner of the appurtenant utility line shall file a request for review pursuant to subsection (e) of this Code section and may be granted up to two extensions of time not to exceed 90 days total upon a showing that the need for an extension is the result of force majeure, grid reliability, work scheduling conflicts, or the lack of market supply of the requisite safety markers and other necessary equipment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Any fine under this subsection shall be tolled for the period from the filing of a petition for a judicial review and shall be subject to judicial review in such manner as is provided by law for judicial review of contested cases under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," until the rendering of a final decision. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">(g)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The department shall promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to implement the provisions of this Code section, including, but not limited to, the promulgation of rules and regulations to establish installation fee schedules based on utility best practices. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
