Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2, the "Georgia Food Act," is a consumer protection Act, designed not to render the workplace a safe environment, but to prevent the sale and distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods to consumers. While safety in the workplace and compensation for injuries arising out of work activities are indeed matters of contemporary concern, they are the subject of other legislative enactments on both the state and federal level. Potts v. Fidelity Fruit &amp; Produce Co., 165 Ga. App. 546, 301 S.E.2d 903 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Determining if violation is negligence per se.</b> - In determining whether the violation of a statute or ordinance, such as O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2, is negligence per se as to a particular person, it is necessary to examine the purposes of the legislation and decide: (1) whether the injured person falls within the class of persons the statute was intended to protect; and (2) whether the harm complained of was the harm the statute was intended to guard against. Potts v. Fidelity Fruit &amp; Produce Co., 165 Ga. App. 546, 301 S.E.2d 903 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Injuries sustained other than in consumption of food not actionable under O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2, </b>Article 2. - When the plaintiff brought an action to recover for personal injuries which the plaintiff allegedly sustained when bitten by a spider while unloading bananas from a truck and the incident occurred during the course of the plaintiff's employment because the alleged injuries did not arise incident to the plaintiff's consumption of the bananas, the trial court was correct in concluding that O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2 affords the plaintiff no basis for recovery. Potts v. Fidelity Fruit &amp; Produce Co., 165 Ga. App. 546, 301 S.E.2d 903 (1983).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p4"><b>Genuine issue of fact remained as to causation of food poisoning.</b> - In an action by rehearsal dinner guests against a caterer alleging food poisoning, summary judgment for the caterer was error; the caterer's circumstantial evidence of the absence of causation (others did not become ill, the guests consumed other food and drink, and did not become ill until days later) was contradicted by other evidence.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Res ipsa loquitur principle misapplied in consumer food product liability case.</b> - In a consumer food product liability case, the trial court misapplied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur because having found that the doctrine applied, the trial court was obligated to allow the jury to determine whether the defendant's negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries under a jury charge that included the principle of res ipsa loquitur instead of granting summary judgment to the defendant.

<p class="p10"><b>5. Standards of Care and Negligence</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff must show knowledge or negligence by food retailer.</b> - In a suit for damages against a seller of unwholesome food which injures the plaintiff, it is still necessary to prove that the defendant either knew of the unwholesome condition of the food or was guilty of negligence in the transaction. Criswell Baking Co. v. Milligan, 77 Ga. App. 861, 50 S.E.2d 136 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-109 and 42-9901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff need only show negligence as matter of law, and not of fact.</b> - When before passage of the Pure-Food and Drug Act of 1906, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), an action for damages resulting from negligence could be sustained only by proof of such negligence as a matter of fact, according to the standard of ordinary prudence as applied to the circumstances, now the plaintiff may show negligence as a matter of law by establishing a breach of the statutory duty, or a plaintiff may rely on both classes of negligence, according to the facts; in other words, the Pure-Food and Drug Act of 1906, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), did not affect the nature or basis of the cause of action, but related only to the standard of care by which negligence could be determined. Criswell Baking Co. v. Milligan, 77 Ga. App. 861, 50 S.E.2d 136 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 2-109).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff can invoke section to show negligence as matter of law.</b> - While the Pure-Food and Drug Act of 1906, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), was designed to protect the public, and did not expressly set forth duties to individual consumers, the plaintiff as a member of the public could invoke its provisions to show negligence as a matter of law, if injured by the violation of a duty imposed by the law. Criswell Baking Co. v. Milligan, 77 Ga. App. 861, 50 S.E.2d 136 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-109 and 42-9901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>By showing breach of statutory duty.</b> - Plaintiffs, charging the defendant with a breach of legal duty in manufacturing and selling pie which they contended was unwholesome and putrid, so that they were injured and damaged by eating the food, since the enactment of the former Pure-Food and Drug Act of 1906, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), could show negligence as a matter of law by establishing a breach of the statutory duty. Criswell Baking Co. v. Milligan, 77 Ga. App. 861, 50 S.E.2d 136 (1948) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-109 and 42-9901).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Sale of adulterated article which causes illness is negligence per se.</b> - Sale of an adulterated article to a customer who is made ill by its consumption, in violation of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), constituted negligence per se. Donaldson v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 59 Ga. App. 79, 200 S.E. 498 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-109, 42-115, 42-9901, and 42-9906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Such as when retailer liable for not having manufacturer's guarantee of wholesomeness.</b> - Retail dealer who sold adulterated food, the sale of which was prohibited by the former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), who had not established a guaranty from the manufacturer as provided in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-115 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-24), that the article was not adulterated within the meaning of former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), although the dealer had no knowledge of the unfit condition of the article sold and was not negligent with respect thereto, would be liable in damages to the person made sick from eating such food without fault on the plaintiff's part. Donaldson v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 59 Ga. App. 79, 200 S.E. 498 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-109, 42-115, 42-9901, and 42-9906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Ordinary care is no defense, in that violation of section constitutes negligence per se.</b> - On the trial of a suit against a dealer by a person alleged to have been made ill from eating alleged adulterated food sold by the defendant, the sale of which was made penal under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-109 and 42-9901 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), which was negligence per se, since the evidence authorized an inference that the food was unfit, decomposed, or putrid and was therefore unfit for human consumption and adulterated as defined in the title, and that the plaintiff was made sick from eating the food, it was error for the court to instruct the jury that if the defendant exercised ordinary care in connection with the sale of the food the plaintiff could not recover. Donaldson v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 59 Ga. App. 79, 200 S.E. 498 (1938) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§§</span> 42-109, 42-115, 42-9901, and 42-9906).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Plaintiff can establish negligence per se as matter of law, and/or negligence as matter of fact.</b> - In a suit for damages against a seller of unwholesome food, the plaintiff may establish negligence as a matter of fact, or the plaintiff may show negligence as a matter of law by establishing a breach of a statutory duty imposed by the provisions of the pure food and drug laws, former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-26), or plaintiff may rely on both classes of negligence. Norris v. Pig'n Whistle Sandwich Shop, Inc., 79 Ga. App. 369, 53 S.E.2d 718 (1949) (decided under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-109).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When dealer with manufacturer's guarantee of wholesomeness still liable for negligence as matter of fact, if not per se.</b> - Under former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-115 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-24), a dealer selling food adulterated within the meaning of that statute would not violate the statute's provisions, and therefore would not be guilty of negligence per se, if the dealer had obtained a guaranty of wholesomeness from the manufacturer but the guaranty would not relieve the dealer from the liability referred to in former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 105-1101 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 51-1-23), if the dealer is negligent as a matter of fact in selling unwholesome food which injures another. It follows that former Code 1933, <span class="s1">§</span> 42-115 (see now O.C.G.A. <span class="s1">§</span> 26-2-24), merely creates an exception to the statute in favor of those who obtain the guaranty.

</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Purpose of the law</b> against adulteration or misbranding is to protect consumers from deception or injury, and it is to be conclusively presumed that the law was adopted to prevent injury to the public health by the sale and transportation in intrastate commerce of misbranded and adulterated foods.

Armour &amp; Co. v. Miller, 39 Ga. App. 228, 147 S.E. 184 (1929) (decided under former Code 1910, <span class="s1">§</span> 2103).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p8">Meat and meat food products are an important source of the nation's total supply of food. It is essential to the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat food products are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged meat and meat food products, and result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat food products as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that regulation by the Commissioner and cooperation by this state and the United States as contemplated by this article are appropriate to the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise effectuate the purposes of this article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8">The General Assembly declares that purchasers and consumers have a right to expect and demand honesty and fair practices in the sale of meat for human consumption. It is the purpose of this Code section and Code Sections 26-2-151 through 26-2-154 to ensure that honest, fair, and ethical practices are followed in the advertising and sale of meat for human consumption and to authorize the Commissioner of Agriculture to take all actions necessary to ensure that such practices are followed. The General Assembly views with alarm the fact that misleading and false advertising and sales tactics have been used in the sale of meat to Georgia consumers. It is to stop these practices that the General Assembly has enacted this Code section and Code Sections 26-2-151 through 26-2-154. The consumer has a right to know what he is buying and the true cost of the meat which he is purchasing for consumption.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

It shall be unlawful to use adjustable scale weights in determining the weight of cream used in the Babcock test. Only such centrifuge shall be used as shall meet the approval of the Commissioner. Specifications for apparatus and chemicals and directions for testing milk and cream must conform to <i>Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products, </i>with such additions as shall be deemed advisable by the Commissioner to make them conform to this article. All test tubes, bottles, pipettes, burettes, or instruments used in connection with testing or determining the value of milk, cream, or other dairy products by the use of the Babcock test must be United States government standard and shall be approved by the Commissioner. All milk and cream tests shall be maintained at a temperature of 135 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three minutes before the reading of the percent of butterfat shall be made and recorded. In reading cream tests, glymol or its equivalent must be used, and the samples under test must be held for three minutes in a water bath extending up as high on the graduated neck as the sample itself does.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>

<p class="p8">(ii) Such prescription drugs require special administration, comprehensive patient training, or the provision of supplies and medical devices or have unique patient compliance and safety monitoring requirements; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(iii) Due to the prescription drug's high monetary cost, short shelf life, special manufacturer specified packaging and shipping requirements or instructions which require temperature sensitive storage and handling, limited availability or distribution, or other factors, the drugs are not carried in the regular inventories of retail pharmacies such that the drugs could be immediately dispensed to multiple retail walk-in patients; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">(iv) Such prescription drug has an annual retail value to the patient of more than $10,000.00; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
