         Definition of "private carrier."
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - A "private carrier" is one who, without being engaged in the business of carrying as a public employment, undertakes to deliver goods in a particular case for hire or reward. McIntyre v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 65</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E. 499</cite> (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Whether person is common carrier or private carrier depends upon facts;
       
       and where there is a question whether the carrier is a private or a common carrier, it is to be determined by the facts relating to, first, whether it is public business or employment, and whether the service is to be rendered to all indifferently; and, second, whether one has so held oneself out as so engaged as to make the person liable for a refusal to accept the employment offered. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E. 515</cite> (1931); In re Ga. Air, Inc., 345 F. Supp. 636 (N.D. Ga. 1972).

       - Whether a person is a common carrier or a private carrier depends upon whether it is public business or employment, and whether the service is to be rendered to all indifferently; and, whether one has so held oneself out as so engaged as to make one liable for refusal to accept the employment offered. McIntyre v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 65</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E. 499</cite> (1931).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Mere fact that carrier invites all and sundry persons to employ the carrier does not render the carrier a common carrier, if the carrier reserves the right of accepting or rejecting their offers of goods for carriage, whether the carrier's vehicles are full or empty, being guided in the carrier's decision by the attractiveness or otherwise of the particular offer, and not by the carrier's ability or inability to carry, having regard to the carrier's other engagements.

       <p>
        <p>
       - If a carrier does not deal with the public indiscriminately as a matter of routine, but in effect makes an individual bargain in each case, this course of business tends to show that the service is upon a private basis.

       - The making of separate contracts is considered in determining whether a person is a private or a public carrier, but is not conclusive, since contracts might be made simply to escape the duties of a common carrier by subterfuge.

       - A joint and several action can be brought against a railroad company and another tort-feasor, and as against the railroad company and its employee, a conductor or engineer, and the action can be brought in the county where the cause of action originated and service perfected by second original, and this is true even though neither defendant resides or has an agent in that county; the same principle is applicable to an action against a motor common carrier and the driver of its motor vehicle for a tort.

       - An action against a common carrier by rail for damages on account of an injury sustained by reason of the negligence of the railroad company in the operation of one of its trains would have to be brought in the county where the injury took place, if the company had an agent in that county; otherwise, the action would be futile, the court not having jurisdiction of the case and any judgment therein void.

     <p>
      By March 2, 1982, the Department of Human Resources (now known as the Department of Human Services) shall develop a program to identify those low or fixed income consumers of gas and electric utility service who, in the department's opinion, should benefit from public assistance in paying their bills for gas and electric service. The department shall also establish an efficient and economical method for distributing to such consumers all public assistance funds which will be made available, whether by appropriations of state or federal funds, grants, or otherwise. All gas and electric utilities shall cooperate fully with the department in developing and implementing its program. Nothing in this Code section shall limit the commission's authority to order regulatory alternatives which assist low or fixed income ratepayers.

       - Georgia Laws 1906, p. 100 creates no new office, but simply provides a new way of filling an office already existing. With respect to their functions, duties, powers, etc., including the liability to removal from office and the method of effecting the same, the officers elected would be subject to the provisions of law existing at the time the method of selection to office was changed.

        Office of Public Service Commissioner is statutory office,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) had the authority to regulate the placement of electrical substations, no requirement existed that every complex construction project be subject to zoning-like restrictions as an agency was not required to exercise the agency's zoning power under O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the Public Service Commission has by statute authority to fix just and reasonable gas rates to be paid by consumers, it has the power to make classifications which are reasonable, and to fix a different rate for each class of consumers; and where such rates are attacked in the courts, there is a presumption that they are valid, and the burden is on the attacking party to show that the same are invalid in that they are unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory.

       - What is just and reasonable to be charged, what is actuarially sound, what limitations of liability are necessary to reach this result, are matters which need to be taken into account in the determination of public utility rates, just as there are proper actuarial considerations in fixing insurance premiums. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Invenchek, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">130 Ga. App. 798</cite>, <cite class="app_court">204 S.E.2d 457</cite> (1974).

       - Where plaintiff fails to utilize the administrative remedies available for investigations and hearings (see O.C.G.A.

       - Trial court erred by affirming a decision of the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) in a ratemaking appeal filed by a gas distribution company and by denying the PSC's motion to dismiss the company's appeal; the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the company's petition for judicial review since one order appealed from was an interim order, and not a final order, and a voice note appealed from was not even a decision subject to review.

       - Since the Public Service Commission has by statute authority to fix just and reasonable gas rates to be paid by consumers, it has the power to make classifications which are reasonable, and to fix a different rate for each class of consumers; and where such rates are attacked in the courts, there is a presumption that they are valid, and the burden is on the attacking party to show that the same are invalid in that they are unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory.

       No person, firm, or corporation (referred to in this Code section as a "utility") subject to the jurisdiction of the commission shall make any change in any rate, charge, classification, or service subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, or in any rule or regulation relating thereto, except after 30 days' notice to the commission and to the public, unless the commission otherwise orders, or unless the commission has previously authorized or approved the change. Such notice shall be given by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating plainly the changes to be made in the schedules then in force and the time when the changes will go into effect. The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect without requiring the 30 days' notice by an order specifying the changes to be made, the time when they shall take effect, and the manner in which they shall be filed and published.

       Whenever any new schedule is filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section, the commission shall have authority, either upon written complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and, if it so orders, without answer or formal pleading by the utility but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, charge, classification, or service. Pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the commission, upon filing with such schedule and delivering to the utility affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a period longer than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect, provided that the commission may apply to the Superior Court of Fulton County for an extension of such period, as provided for in Code Section 46-2-57. After such hearings as are required, whether they are completed before or after the rate, charge, classification, or service goes into effect, the commission may make such orders as are proper with reference thereto within the authority vested in the commission. The commission is empowered to reduce or revoke any such suspension with respect to all or any part of such schedule. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order not made at the expiration of the suspension period, the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service shall go into effect at the end of such period; but in case of a proposed increased rate or charge, the commission shall by order require the interested utility to keep accurate account in detail of all amounts received by reason of such increase, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts were paid; and upon completion of the hearing and the rendering of a decision, the commission shall by further order require such utility to refund, with interest at the maximum legal rate, in such manner as the commission may direct, such portion of such increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. Any portion of such refunds not thus refunded to patrons or customers of the utility shall be refunded or disposed of by the utility as the commission may direct, provided that no such funds shall accrue to the benefit of the utility. At any hearing involving a rate or charge sought to be increased, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just and reasonable shall be upon the utility, and the commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.

The bond shall be payable to the Governor and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the requirements of the refund order entered by the commission, the requirements of this Code section, and the requirements of the rules and regulations of the commission.

      (c.1) (1)Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a utility shall recover from its customers, as provided in this subsection, the costs of financing associated with the construction of a nuclear generating plant which has been certified by the commission prior to January 1, 2018. The financing charges shall accrue on all applicable certified costs as they are recorded in the utility's construction work in progress accounts pursuant to generally accepted accounting and regulatory principles as approved by the commission. The financing costs shall be based on the utility's actual cost of debt, as reflected in its annual surveillance report filed with the commission, and based on the authorized cost of equity capital and capital structure as determined by the commission when setting the utility's current base rates. These financing costs shall be recovered from each customer through a separate rate tariff and allocated on an equal percentage basis to standard base tariffs which are designed to collect embedded capacity costs. The commission shall retain the discretion to consider the effect of this tariff when setting the level of any senior or low income assistance it may authorize; provided, however, that the income qualification for such assistance shall be 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall have the authority to authorize any specific accounting treatment for the costs recovered pursuant to this subsection and to review whether costs recovered pursuant to this subsection are being properly recorded.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A) For any nuclear generating plant certified by the commission on or after July 1, 2009, the utility may begin recovering the costs of financing the construction of the nuclear generating plant at any time within five years after the date on which such nuclear generating plant is certified. Any such costs incurred between the time the plant is certified and the time the utility begins recovering its cost shall be accrued, capitalized, and included in the balance of the account and then amortized over the next five years following the date on which the utility begins recovering the costs of financing the construction and shall be recovered with one-fifth of those deferred costs being recovered each year for five years.
     </p>
     <p>
      For any nuclear generating plant certified by the commission on or after January 1, 2009, and before July 1, 2009, the utility shall begin recovering on January 1, 2011, any costs of financing the construction of the nuclear generating plant. Any such costs incurred prior to January 1, 2011, shall be accrued, capitalized, and included in the balance of the account and then amortized over the next five years following January 1, 2011, and shall be recovered with one-fifth of those deferred costs being recovered each year for five years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The costs recoverable pursuant to this subsection shall be recalculated and the level of the charges reset annually if necessary to reflect the level of construction costs expected to be incurred in the next 12 months consistent with the certificate and the financing costs expected to be incurred for the next 12 months together with a balanced accounting of actual expenditures and financing costs incurred in the preceding period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financing costs associated with a nuclear generating plant which has been certified by the commission shall continue to be recovered between the time that the generating plant begins commercial operation and until the next general rate case filed by the utility becomes effective, at which time the financing costs being collected for any generating plants which are then in commercial operation shall be included in the general revenue requirements of the utility and collected in the general base rates of the utility.

      <li id="t46c02s46-2-26.1ol1b">
       In any proceeding to determine the rates to be charged by an electric utility, the electric utility shall file jurisdictionally allocated cost of service data on the basis of a test period, and the commission shall utilize a test period, consisting of actual data for the most recent 12 month period for which data are available, fully adjusted separately to reflect estimated operations during the 12 months following the utility's proposed effective date of the rates. After the initial filing and until new rates go into effect, the utility shall file actual cost of service data as they become available for each month following the actual data which were filed. The utility shall have the burden of explaining and supporting the reasonableness of all estimates and adjustments contained in its cost of service data.

      <li id="t46c02s46-2-26.1ol1c">
       In any case after March 2, 1981, in which an electric utility transfers partial or total ownership of any electric plant, the electric utility shall return to its ratepayers, in such manner as the commission may prescribe, the ratepayers' cash contribution to the cost of construction, plus the income taxes paid, accrued, and collected by the electric utility in respect thereof, and a portion of the profit, if any, on such transfer.
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c02s46-2-26.1ol1c1">
         The ratepayers' contribution to the cost of construction shall be determined by first multiplying the amount of construction and preconstruction expenditures included in the rate base by the authorized return allowed by the commission for the electric utility on the jurisdictional rate base during the period or periods such expenditures were included in the rate base, and then subtracting therefrom any carrying costs capitalized in respect of such construction and preconstruction expenditures included in the rate base. In the event an electric utility transfers partial or total ownership of any electric plant after it has commenced commercial operation, the ratepayers' contribution to the cost of construction shall be reduced in proportion to the remaining life of the electric plant.

        <li id="t46c02s46-2-26.1ol1c2">
         The profit, if any, on such transfer shall be allocated between the electric utility and its ratepayers in proportion to their respective contributions to the cost of construction. For the purposes of this calculation, the ratepayers' contribution shall be determined as provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection. The electric utility's contribution shall be the cost, including carrying costs, of the transferred electric plant as recorded on the books and records of the electric utility. The amount of profit, if any, shall be determined by deducting the sum of the ratepayers' and the electric utility's contributions to the cost of construction from the gross proceeds of the transfer.

The appropriate rate shall be an amount which is not less than the amount necessary to amortize the cost of conversion, as herein defined over a period of not more than seven years on a per kilowatt-hour basis taking into consideration the estimated kilowatt hours to be generated for sale by the utility during the first full 12 months in operation of the facility. In determining the rate to recover the cost of conversion, the commission shall permit recovery by the utility of the cost of conversion net of such federal, state, or local taxes based on revenue and income which may be imposed upon the utility for receipt of proceeds of the fuel-savings-allocation which cannot be reasonably avoided by the utility using due diligence.

       Public Service Commission may perform quasi-judicial functions as well as quasi-legislative functions.
      
      The distinction between the two types of functions has been deemed of importance because where a proceeding is judicial or quasi-judicial in nature, the parties whose rights are adjudicated are entitled to the protection afforded by judicial forms of procedure.

       - The administrative procedure applicable on an application for, or a proceeding to amend, a motor carrier's certificate of convenience and necessity is not that prescribed by the Georgia Administrative Procedure Act in view of Ga. L. 1975, p. 404, which made the Public Service Commission otherwise subject to the GAPA except any rate, charge, classification, service hearing, procedure or matter which shall pertain to any motor contract carrier, motor common carrier, or railroad. The applicable procedure is that established by O.C.G.A.

      In investigating complaints of violations by common carriers of the laws prohibiting the giving or granting of rebates and prohibiting unjust discrimination in rates and charges, the commission may exercise the power and authority to compel the shipper or consignee, or any officer, agent, or employee of a common carrier to give evidence relating to such complaints. Before any such person shall be compelled to give evidence relating to such complaints, the commission shall make an order that such witness is required by the commission to testify and that he will be exempt thereafter from indictment or prosecution for any transaction about which he is compelled to testify. When such order is made, the witness shall be compelled to give evidence touching such complaints, and he shall be forever free from indictment or prosecution in any court touching the matters about which he is compelled to testify.

     <p>
      The public interest requires, and it is declared to be the policy of the State of Georgia, that, in order (1) to assure the most efficient, economical, and orderly rendering of retail electric service within the state, (2) to inhibit duplication of the lines of electric suppliers, (3) to foster the extension and location of electric supplier lines in the manner most compatible with the preservation and enhancement of the state's physical environment, and (4) to protect and conserve lines lawfully constructed by electric suppliers, it is necessary and appropriate that the state establish and implement a plan whereby every geographic area within the state shall be either assigned to an electric supplier or declared unassigned as to any electric supplier; that, to accomplish such a plan, it is necessary that all electric suppliers within the state be subject to this part; that the commission be delegated power, authority, and jurisdiction with respect to such plan; and that all electric membership corporations and all municipalities which furnish retail electric service be additionally subject to regulation by the commission in the same manner as provided for regulation of electric light and power companies, except as to the fixing of their rates, charges, and service rules and regulations, it being determined by the General Assembly that such electric membership corporations and municipalities, which by their corporate nature are wholly or substantially controlled by their consumers, should for regulatory purposes be classified differently in certain respects from electric light and power companies.

     <p>
      After March 29, 1973, and continuing thereafter as rapidly as it is administratively practicable to do so, the commission is authorized and directed to assign to electric suppliers or to declare as unassigned areas-B all geographic areas in this state that were, on March 29, 1973, located outside the corporate limits of any municipality. Such assignments and declarations of unassignment shall be effected by the commission in accordance with the following standards:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t46c03s46-3-4ol11">
       Assigned areas shall be described by defined boundaries on maps to be filed with the commission and incorporated by it in its orders. Where deemed necessary or appropriate, the commission may require boundaries to be additionally described by written metes and bounds;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03s46-3-4ol12">
       Each geographic area assigned shall be assigned to only one electric supplier, as determined by public convenience and necessity, having primary regard for the location of electric suppliers' lines but having no regard for differences in electric suppliers' retail rates or for the fact that retail consumers are not then being served from such lines;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03s46-3-4ol13">
       Each geographic area assigned shall be so assigned that its boundaries enclose land spaces in which the assignee electric supplier owns all or a preponderance of the lines, provided that a geographic area may be so assigned or declared unassigned even though it is completely surrounded by the inner boundaries of another geographic area assigned to an electric supplier. Boundaries will be located around the perimeter of such land spaces so as to be approximately 1,000 feet from the nearest of the assignee electric supplier's lines so enclosed, provided that if the lines of two or more electric suppliers are closer together than 2,000 feet, the boundary shall be located approximately halfway between them; provided, however, that where compelling factors of public convenience and necessity so require, including the need for using natural and manmade landmarks for boundary references, the location of a boundary may vary somewhat more or somewhat less than such 1,000 foot or halfway distance; provided, further, that such 1,000 foot or halfway distance standards shall not apply to any lines of the assignee electric supplier which extend from inside the assigned area outside such area or to any lines of any other electric supplier which extend from outside the area inside or completely across such area and which do not otherwise occasion assignment or unassignment of land space, the rights and restrictions applying to such other electric supplier's lines inside such area being as provided for in paragraph (4) of this Code section;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03s46-3-4ol14">
       A line of an electric supplier which extends into or completely crosses a land space in which another electric supplier owns a preponderance of the lines may nevertheless be considered as the basis for assigning or declaring unassigned land space related thereto; but, unless such line so occasions an assignment or an unassignment, then, from and after the date of the assignment to an electric supplier of the geographic area within which such line is enclosed and based upon the location of both suppliers' lines on that date, the electric supplier owning such enclosed line shall have the exclusive right to extend and continue furnishing service to all new premises locating at least partially within 500 feet of such line and wholly more than 500 feet from the assignee electric supplier's lines and shall have the right, if chosen by the consumer utilizing such premises, to extend and continue furnishing service to new premises locating at least partially within 500 feet of both electric suppliers' lines but shall not otherwise have the right, unless so agreed by the assignee electric supplier and the consumer utilizing such premises, to extend and furnish service to any other premises locating inside such assigned area;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03s46-3-4ol15">
       Except where public convenience and necessity require their assignment, the commission shall declare as unassigned areas-B those land spaces which are not assigned to an electric supplier pursuant to any other provision of this part; and
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03s46-3-4ol16">
       Not inconsistent with Code Section 46-3-8, any electric supplier may apply to the commission for assignment to it of one or more geographic areas or for the commission to declare one or more geographic areas to be unassigned areas-B.

       - The indemnity provision of the High Voltage safety Act (HVSA) may be enforced without offending the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers' Compensation Act by according indemnity actions pursuant to the HVSA the same dignity case law has given contractual indemnity provisions executed by private parties. The HVSA authorizes a power line owner or operator to obtain indemnification from an employer on account of the employer's failure to abide by the safety provisions in the HVSA. Flint Elec.

    - The Municipal Electric Authority has authority to function and contract as instrumentality of the state in providing electric power to the political subdivisions of the state which own and operate electric distribution systems, and to contract with power companies, electric membership corporations, and political subdivisions for the purchase, ownership, operation, and maintenance of the facilities which constitute the subject matter of the contracts.

       In the discretion of the authority, any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust agreement or indenture made by the authority with a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without this state. Such trust agreement or indenture may pledge or assign all revenue, receipts, and earnings to be received by the authority and any proceeds which may be derived from the disposition of any real or personal property of the authority or proceeds of insurance carried thereon.

       The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds and such trust agreement or indenture may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond owners, including the right of appointment of a receiver upon default in the payment of any principal or interest obligation and the right of any receiver or trustee to enforce collection of any rates, fees, tolls, charges, or revenues for the use of the services or facilities of the project necessary to pay all costs of operation and all reserves provided for, the principal of and interest on all bonds in the issue, all costs of collection, and all other costs reasonably necessary to accomplish the collection of such sums in the event of any default of the authority.

In addition, such resolution, trust agreement, or indenture may include covenants providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, and insurance of the project and may contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional bonds may be issued.

      <li id="t46c03s46-3-136ol1d">
       Such resolution, trust agreement, or indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bond owners and of the trustee; may restrict the individual right of action of any bond owner in such manner as is customary in securing bonds and debentures of corporations; and may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bond owners.

       - Property owners' claims against a utility were not time-barred because the owners filed suit within two months of the utility's alleged trespass and conversion as the destruction of more vegetation by the utility, which had previously clear cut trees on the owners' property, was new. Given the evidence that a utility representative disclaimed any easement or other right to enter the property again after the first incident, the second entry could not be deemed as a matter of law to be part of a continuing trespass. Daniel v. Amicalola Elec. Mbrshp. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">289 Ga. 437</cite>, <cite class="app_court">711 S.E.2d 709</cite> (2011).

       - Property owners' argument that a utility defrauded the owners by claiming that the utility had no easement and no plan to enter the owners' property again did not toll the owners' claims relating to the entry of the owners' property because the trespass was completed and would not recur, and no matter what, the utility could not put back the trees and vegetation the utility had clear-cut, so the conversion was complete. There was no allegation, much less evidence, that the utility misled the owners as to a damages action. Daniel v. Amicalola Elec. Mbrshp. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">289 Ga. 437</cite>, <cite class="app_court">711 S.E.2d 709</cite> (2011).

       The General Assembly finds that electric membership corporations providing broadband services should be permitted to use existing electric easements to provide or expand access to broadband services. The General Assembly also finds that utilizing existing electric easements to provide broadband services, without the placement of additional poles or other ground based structures, does not change the physical use of the easement, interfere with or impair any vested rights of the owner or occupier of the real property subject to the electric easement, or place any additional burden on the property interests of such owner or occupier. Consequently, the installation and operation of broadband services within any electric easement are merely changes in the manner or degree of the granted use as appropriate to accommodate a new technology and, absent any applicable express prohibition contained in the instrument conveying or granting the electric easement, shall be deemed as a matter of law to be a permitted use within the scope of every electric easement.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03s46-3-205ol1b">
       Subject to compliance with any express prohibitions in an electric easement, the owner of an electric easement may use an electric easement to install, maintain, lease, and operate broadband services without incurring liability to the owner or occupant of the real property subject to the electric easement or paying additional compensation to the owner or occupant of the real property subject to the electric easement, so long as no additional poles or other ground based structures are installed; provided, however, that any electric utility owning an electric easement may assess fees and charges and impose reasonable conditions on the use of its facilities within an electric easement for the purpose of providing or supporting broadband services.

        <p>
       - Electric membership corporation (EMC) board's proxy voting bylaw amendment violated the terms of a settlement agreement reached between the EMC and the corporation's members because the amendment significantly changed the conditions under which the parties' agreed-upon plan for proposing proxy voting to the members was implemented. It therefore violated the spirit if not the letter of the agreement in contravention of O.C.G.A.

         Proxy voting amendment violated settlement agreement.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Electric membership corporation (EMC) board's proxy voting bylaw amendment violated the terms of a settlement agreement reached between the EMC and the EMC's members because the amendment significantly changed the conditions under which the parties' agreed-upon plan for proposing proxy voting to the members was implemented. It therefore violated the spirit if not the letter of the agreement in contravention of O.C.G.A.

       A foreign electric cooperative whose certificate of authority has been revoked by the Secretary of State under the conditions prescribed by Code Section 46-3-466 shall be reinstated by the Secretary of State by the issuance of a certificate of reinstatement. The certificate of reinstatement may be issued at any time within five years from the date of the certificate of revocation upon approval of an application for reinstatement executed by the foreign electric cooperative as provided in Code Section 46-3-173 and filed with the Secretary of State as provided in Code Section 46-3-174. The Secretary of State shall issue the certificate of reinstatement whenever it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that in fact there was no cause for revocation or whenever the omission or delinquency resulting in revocation has been corrected and payment made of all fees, taxes, and penalties which accrued before revocation.

Once a person has filed such an application, the portion of the certificate of the territory for which the applicant is seeking to provide natural gas service to a specified end-use customer, property owner, or developer shall be deemed revoked or amended. The commission shall determine whether the applicant shall be entitled to a certificate for the territory that has been excluded from the certificate by revocation or amendment, whether such territory should be re-issued to the person who held the certificate at the time of the application, or whether such territory shall be deemed uncertificated. The commission shall make such determination within 90 days of the application and shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in subsection (a) of Code Section 46-4-25, whether the applicant can offer service in a timely manner, and such other factors the commission deems in the public interest. The commission in determining whether to reissue a certificate to the person who held the certificate at the time of the application shall consider the length of time the certificate was held without service being provided. The newly certificated area shall be designed by the commission to serve the customers, property owners, or developers in question while ensuring a boundary with safety and public welfare as the focus.

In such proceeding, the commission shall also prescribe a mechanism by which 95 percent of the revenues to the electing distribution company from rates for interruptible distribution service shall be credited to the universal service fund established for that electing distribution company pursuant to Code Section 46-4-161. Each electing distribution company is authorized to retain for the benefit of its shareholders or owners 5 percent of the revenues the electing distribution company received from rates for interruptible service.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the rising cost and uncertain supply of energy resources require an active program of energy conservation assistance, especially for the residential sector, which often has limited access to expert advice on energy conservation. In response to this need and to the mandate of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, P.L. 95-619, the former Office of Energy Resources, now the Division of Energy Resources of the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, on behalf of the Office of Planning and Budget, has developed the state plan for the Residential Conservation Service, which requires certain utilities to offer home energy audits and related services to residential customers. Further, the General Assembly finds that in order to ensure the implementation of the state plan for the Residential Conservation Service and avoid the imposition of the federal plan, adequate authority for state enforcement of the state plan must be instituted. Therefore, in order to provide Georgia's regulated utilities and their customers with the most appropriate and flexible plan for carrying out the Residential Conservation Service, the General Assembly declares that the Office of Planning and Budget shall be authorized to promulgate regulations to establish the Residential Conservation Service and provide for its enforcement.

In the event the due compensation remitted to the affected municipal authority is not postmarked on or before the expiration of the 15 day cure period, such company shall pay interest thereon at a rate of 1 percent per month to the affected municipal authority.

         Each municipal authority may, no more than once annually, audit the business records of a telephone company to the extent necessary to ensure payment in accordance with this Code section. As used in this Code section, "audit" means a comprehensive review of the records of a company which is reasonably related to the calculation and payment of due compensation. Once any audited period of a company has been the subject of a requested audit, such audited period of such company shall not again be the subject of any audit. In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of due compensation due to an affected municipal authority under this Code section, an action may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by an affected municipal authority seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due or by a company seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment; provided, however, that any such action shall be brought within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates, although such time period may be extended by written agreement between the company and such affected municipal authority. Each party shall bear the party's own costs incurred in connection with any dispute. The auditing municipal authority shall bear the cost of the audit; provided, however, that if an affected municipal authority files an action to recover alleged underpayments of due compensation and a court of competent jurisdiction determines the company has underpaid due compensation due for any 12 month period by 10 percent or more, such company shall be required to pay such municipal authority's reasonable costs associated with such audit along with any due compensation underpayments; provided, further, that late payments shall not apply. All undisputed amounts due to a municipal authority resulting from an audit shall be paid to the municipal authority within 45 days, or interest shall accrue.

       and could exercise that power to acquire the right to erect their lines upon the railroad's right of way.

       As used in this Code section, the term "service member" means an active duty member of the regular or reserve component of the United States armed forces, the United States Coast Guard, the Georgia National Guard, or the Georgia Air National Guard on ordered federal duty for a period of 90 days or longer.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1b">
       Any service member may terminate his or her wireless telecommunications service contract by providing the wireless telecommunications provider with a written notice of termination, effective on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be at least 30 days after receipt of the notice by the wireless telecommunications provider, if any of the following criteria are met:
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1b1">
         The service member is required, pursuant to a permanent change of station orders, to move outside the area served by the wireless telecommunications provider or to an area where the type of wireless telecommunications service being provided to the service member is not available from the wireless telecommunications provider;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1b2">
         The service member is discharged or released from active duty or state active duty and will return from such duty to an area not served by the wireless telecommunications provider or where the type of telecommunications service contracted for is not available from the wireless telecommunications provider;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1b3">
         The service member is released from active duty after having entered into a contract for wireless telecommunications service while on active duty status and the wireless telecommunications provider does not provide telecommunications service or the same type of wireless telecommunications service contracted for in the region of the service member's home of record prior to entering active duty;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1b4">
         The service member receives military orders requiring him or her to move outside the continental United States; or

         The service member receives temporary duty orders, temporary change of station orders, or active duty or state active duty orders to an area not served by the wireless telecommunications provider or where the type of wireless telecommunications service contracted for is not available from the wireless telecommunications provider, provided such orders are for a period exceeding 60 days.

      </li>
      <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1c">
       The written notice to the wireless telecommunications provider must be accompanied by either a copy of the official military orders or a written verification signed by the service member's commanding officer.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1d">
       Upon termination of a contract under this Code section, the service member is liable for the amount due under the contract prorated to the effective date of the termination payable at such time as would have otherwise been required by the terms of the contract. The service member is not liable for any other fees due to the early termination of the contract as provided for in this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c05s46-5-8ol1e">
       The provisions of this Code section shall apply to any contract for wireless telecommunications service entered into on or after July 1, 2005, and to any renewals, modifications, or extensions of any such contract in effect on such date and may not be waived or modified by the agreement of the parties under any circumstances.

        The General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the public interest to provide telecommunications services to all citizens of this state who, because of physical impairments, particularly hearing and speech impairments, cannot otherwise communicate over the telephone. It is further in the public interest to take advantage of innovative technological uses of telecommunications services to allow for universal access to information by blind and otherwise print disabled citizens of this state.

        The commission shall require all local exchange telephone companies in this state, except those operated by telephone membership corporations, to impose a monthly maintenance surcharge on all residential and business local exchange access facilities. For the purpose of this subsection, "exchange access facility" means the access from a particular telephone subscriber's premise to the telephone system of a local exchange telephone company. "Exchange access facility" includes local exchange company provided access lines, private branch exchange trunks, and centrex network access registers, all as defined by tariffs of telephone companies as approved by the commission. The amount of the surcharge shall be determined by the commission based upon the amount of funding necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Code section and provide the services on an ongoing basis; however, in no case shall the amount exceed 20› per month. A maximum of 5› of this monthly surcharge per access line shall be utilized for a telecommunications equipment distribution program and a maximum of 1› of this monthly surcharge per access line shall be utilized to fund an audible universal information access service. If the projected cost of the operation of the relay service exceeds a monthly surcharge of 15› at any time, funding for the telecommunications equipment distribution program and the audible universal information access service shall be reduced by the amount required to fully fund the relay service, under the existing cap of 20› for the period of time necessary. No additional fees other than the surcharge authorized by this subsection, if applicable, shall be imposed on any user of such relay or information access service. The local exchange companies shall collect the surcharge from their customers and transfer the moneys collected to a special fund to be held separate from all other funds. The fund shall be used solely for the administration and operation of the relay service, the information access service, and the telecommunications equipment distribution program and for other hearing technology and shall not be imposed, collected, or expended for any other purpose.

The bylaws shall prescribe the number of directors, their qualifications, other than those prescribed in this part, the manner of holding meetings of the board of directors and of electing successors to directors who resign, die, or otherwise become incapable of acting. The bylaws may also provide for the removal of directors from office and for the election of their successors. Directors shall not receive any salaries for their services as such and, except in emergencies, shall not receive any salaries for their services in any other capacity without the approval of the members. The bylaws may, however, prescribe a fixed fee for attendance at each meeting of the board of directors and may provide for reimbursement of actual expenses of attendance.

Thereafter, as directors' terms expire, the members shall elect their successors to serve until the second succeeding annual meeting after their election. Instead of electing all of the directors annually or biannually, the bylaws may provide that one-third of them, or a number as near thereto as possible, shall be elected to serve until the next annual meeting of the members, that one-third shall be elected to serve until the second succeeding annual meeting of the members, and that the remaining directors shall be elected to serve until the third succeeding annual meeting.

       The General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid. There currently exist numerous different emergency phone numbers throughout the state. Provision for a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public service efforts by making it easier to notify public safety personnel. Such a simplified means of procuring emergency services will result in the saving of lives, a reduction in the destruction of property, and quicker apprehension of criminals. It is the intent of the General Assembly to establish and implement a cohesive state-wide emergency telephone number 9-1-1 system which will provide citizens with rapid, direct access to public safety agencies by dialing telephone number 9-1-1 with the objective of reducing the response time to situations requiring law enforcement, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c05s46-5-121ol1b">
       The General Assembly further finds and declares that the benefits of 9-1-1 service should be widely available, regardless of whether a 9-1-1 call is placed from a traditional landline telephone or from a wireless telephone. It is also in the public interest that users of wireless telephones should bear some of the cost of providing this lifesaving service, as users of landline telephones currently do. It is the intent of the General Assembly to bring wireless telephone service within the scope of this part and to establish a means by which local public safety agencies may provide enhanced 9-1-1 service to wireless telephone users.

      <li id="t46c05s46-5-121ol1c">
       The General Assembly further finds and declares that communication technology is rapidly and constantly changing. It is in the public interest that as different means of accessing 9-1-1 service emerge, that the users of such technology bear some of the cost of providing this lifesaving service, as users of landline and wireless telephones currently do. It is the intent of the General Assembly to bring these new and emerging technologies within the scope of this part and establish a means by which local public safety agencies may provide 9-1-1 service to such users.

       The General Assembly further finds and declares that the safety and well-being of the citizens of Georgia is of the utmost importance, and it is in the public interest to provide the highest level of emergency response service on a local, regional, and state-wide basis.

      <li id="t46c05s46-5-121ol1e">
       The General Assembly further finds that the collection methodology for prepaid wireless telecommunications service should effectively capture 9-1-1 charges from prepaid users. It is the intent of the General Assembly to move the collection of existing 9-1-1 charges on prepaid wireless service to the retail point of sale.

       - Wanton and willful conduct differs from gross negligence. Willful conduct is based on an actual intention to do harm or inflict injury, while wanton conduct is that which is so reckless or so charged with indifference to the consequences as to justify the jury in finding a wantonness equivalent in spirit to actual intent.

Such resolution, or any amendment to such resolution, shall fix a date on which such resolution and the imposition and collection of the 9-1-1 charge or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge, as provided in the resolution, shall become effective; provided, however, that such effective date shall be at least 120 days following the date of the adoption of such resolution or any amendment to such resolution by the local government. The 9-1-1 charge must be uniform, may not vary according to the type of telephone service used, and may be billed on a monthly or quarterly basis. The wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge must be uniform, not vary according to the type of wireless telecommunications connection used, and may be billed on a monthly or quarterly basis.

      In the event that the remedies provided by Code Section 46-5-185 fail to restore a person or entity to that person's or entity's selected primary carrier of local exchange or long distance service and fail to reimburse the person or entity for the difference between the charges for the unauthorized and the authorized service, within 90 days of the person's or entity's report of an unwanted, unauthorized change of a primary local exchange or long distance carrier to the carriers or the commission as provided in Code Section 46-5-185, then such person or entity whose primary carrier of local exchange or long distance service has been switched in violation of this article may bring an action to recover damages from the telecommunications company responsible for the violation. The superior, magistrate, and state courts of this state shall have jurisdiction over such actions. Notwithstanding any provision of Code Section 46-2-9 to the contrary, such action may be brought in any county of this state in which the telecommunications company transacts business within 24 months of the date of the unauthorized switch of a primary carrier; provided, however, that the running of the statute of limitations shall be tolled during the 90 day period during which the matter is under investigation pursuant to Code Section 46-5-185. Such action shall proceed in all respects like other civil suits for damages, except that on the trial of such suits any findings of the commission made pursuant to Code Section 46-5-190 shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts stated therein, and damages shall be calculated as three times the amount of the difference between the charges for the unauthorized and the authorized service from the date of the unauthorized switch in the complainant's service. A prevailing plaintiff shall be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation incurred in connection with an action brought under this Code section.

   Telephone records can be of great use to criminals because the information contained in call logs listed in such records include a wealth of personal data;

   Many call logs reveal the names of telephone users' doctors, public and private relationships, business associates, and more;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3)
   Although other personal information such as social security numbers may appear on public documents, which can be accessed by data brokers, the only warehouse of telephone records is located at the telephone companies themselves;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4)
   Telephone records are sometimes accessed without authorization of the customer by:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A)
   An employee of the telephone service provider selling the data; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) 'Pretexting,' whereby a data broker or other person pretends to be the owner of the telephone and convinces the telephone company's employees to release the data to such person; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Telephone companies encourage customers to manage their accounts online with many setting up the online capability in advance, although many customers never access their account online. If someone seeking the information activates the account before the customer, he or she can gain unfettered access to the telephone records and call logs of that customer."

        - Where separate lines of railway start out at a right angle from a seaport, transport freight and passengers from widely separated sections of two states, and no point on either road can be reached in any reasonable time by a passenger starting out on the other, such consolidation does not tend to defeat competition and create monopoly merely because both lines cross two shallow rivers, on which steamboats carrying freight and passengers occasionally ply.

   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a)
   The General Assembly finds that the railroads and their rights of way in Georgia:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) Are essential to the continued viability of this state;

      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) Provide a necessary means of transporting raw materials, agricultural products, other finished products, and consumer goods and are also essential for the safe passage of hazardous materials;

       "(5) Relieve congestion on the highways and keep dangerous products and materials off our highways;

       - Where a railroad company has the right to condemn private property for public uses in the construction and operation of its road, it has a large discretion in the selection of a location for its route over such property; and unless such discretion has been abused, it will not be controlled or interfered with by the courts.

       - Upon the trial of a case wherein the owner of the property through which it is proposed to run such road complains that such discretion of the company has been abused by it, it is error to exclude testimony relevant and material upon the issue as to whether or not the company has acted in bad faith in the selection of such location.

         Absence of crossbuck sign not proximate cause where motorist hits side of train.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - The absence of a railroad crossbuck sign at a railroad crossing bore no causal relationship and was not a proximate cause of the accident where the motorist ran into the side of the moving train, which had been in the crossing for several minutes and was in plain view and within the range of the driver's headlights.

       - Where a railroad company blocks with its cars a crossing on a public highway for a needless or unreasonable length of time, a pedestrian, after waiting a reasonable time for such cars to be removed, may turn aside to avoid the obstruction and pass over property of the company without being a trespasser in so doing, and in such a case the questions as to the reasonableness of the time of blocking and waiting, whether the company owed to the pedestrian the duty, under the facts and circumstances, of anticipating the pedestrian's presence, and the diligence due and exercised by the company for the pedestrian's safety, are jury questions.

       - Railroad company is bound to exercise extraordinary diligence toward passenger while in act of alighting from train. Metts v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 531</cite> (1935).

       <p>
        <p>
       Ordinarily there is no duty upon carrier to assist passenger in boarding or alighting from its train; whether in a given case the circumstances are such as to suggest the necessity of assisting a passenger to board or alight from a train or car is a question to be determined by the jury. Metts v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 531</cite> (1935).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Mere presence of safety precautions such as automatic signalling devices does not render railroad free from negligence as matter of law or relieve it from adopting such other measures as public safety and common prudence dictate; this is especially true when the evidence shows that a train was running at an undue and highly dangerous rate of speed over a much frequented crossing located in a city or town.

       <p>
        <p>
       - If those in control of the movement of the train have no reason to apprehend that there may likely be a human being on the track in front of the engine, they are under no duty to one who may in fact be there until they have actually discovered that one is there; but if, from the locality or surrounding circumstances, there is reason to apprehend that the track in front of the locomotive may not be clear of human beings, then it is the duty of the employees of the company to keep a lookout ahead of the train.

       - A peddler, in going in between the tracks to a railroad car for the purpose of vending the peddler's wares to the employees of a railroad company, where this was permitted by the employees for their benefit, is a licensee, and it can not be said that the peddler's presence there is negligence as a matter of law.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - A railroad company cannot be held liable for injuries received by a passenger while being transported over the company's lines by virtue of a gratuitous pass, which exempted the company from liability for injuries caused by ordinary negligence, unless the injuries were inflicted willfully and wantonly; to authorize a recovery against the company by such a person, it must appear that the conduct of the defendant was such as to evince a willful intention to inflict such an injury, or else was so reckless or so charged with indifference to the consequences, where human life, limb, or health was involved, as to justify the jury in finding a wantonness equivalent in spirit to actual intent. Devero v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 421</cite> (1935).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where one employed generally by a railroad is issued trip passes on trains to go to and from work, and who is also permitted to ride without the payment of fare without using one's pass, and who is not engaged in or within the scope of one's employment while so riding on a train, one occupies the status of a passenger for hire, and the railroad is liable to that person for injuries inflicted by its negligence, while one is so riding, and if the injury occurs at a time when the employee is using one's pass, a limitation therein relieving the railroad from liability on account of its negligence is void. Fowler v. Western &amp; A.R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">75 Ga. App. 156</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 499</cite> (1947).

       - Where an action against a carrier was founded upon the alleged wrongful ejection of the plaintiff as a passenger, and no negligence of the carrier or the carrier's employees was alleged, the wrong complained of was to be regarded not as negligence, but as "improper conduct," under former Civil Code 1910,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The general rule is that a railroad company owes to a trespasser, walking upon its tracks, the duty not to injure the trespasser willfully or wantonly after the trespasser's presence is known to its servants in charge of the train; but this duty is not active until the trespasser's presence is actually known. Collett v. Atlanta, B. &amp; C.R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 637</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 207</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where party is a trespasser, and the party is not in a path which the railroad knows people customarily use, the only duty the railroad owes the party is not to wantonly or willfully injure the trespasser after the trespasser's presence is discovered. Cook v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_app_court">62 Ga. App. 613</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 123</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ordinarily, the servants of a railway company are not bound to anticipate the presence of a trespasser on or about its tracks, and the duty of exercising ordinary care in order to protect such a trespasser does not generally arise until after the trespasser's presence has been actually discovered. Southern Ry. v. Kelley, <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 137</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 631</cite> (1935).

        <p>
       - Ordinarily the only duty which a railway company owes to a trespasser upon or about its property is not to injure the trespasser willfully or wantonly after the trespasser's presence has been discovered, and this principle of law applies to the duty of a railway company towards a dead body which happens to be upon its tracks.

       - Where a number of persons habitually, with the knowledge and without the disapproval of a railroad company, use a private passageway for the purpose of crossing the tracks of the company at a given point, the employees of the company in charge of one of its trains, who are aware of the custom, are bound on a given occasion to anticipate that persons may be upon the tracks at this point, but it is not their duty to take such precautions as would prevent injury to such person; their duty is merely to take such precautions to prevent such injury as ordinary care and diligence would require. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Hemmings, <cite class="ga_app_court">66 Ga. App. 881</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 787</cite> (1942); Southern Ry. v. Waldrup, <cite class="ga_app_court">76 Ga.

        - Whether plaintiff is a trespasser or licensee, the railroad is bound to use ordinary care and diligence in approaching and traversing places where there is reason for it to anticipate that persons might be on the track; in such a situation, the general rule, that the railroad owes a trespasser a duty of ordinary care only after discovery of the trespasser in a place of peril, does not apply.

       Where, from the locality, circumstances, and known habits of the public generally, there is reason to apprehend that the track in front of the locomotive may not be clear of human beings, then the duty of anticipating the presence of and danger to such trespassers devolves on the employees of the company operating the train.

       While it is true that a railroad track is a place of danger, and one who trespasses thereon is guilty of negligence, yet when the railroad company discovers this negligence, or has reason to anticipate it, and such a trespasser is on the track in an apparently helpless condition, ordinary diligence requires the use of every means then available to avoid running down and killing the trespasser; and if, under such circumstances, this degree of care is not exercised, and death results, the killing will be deemed in law to have been willful and wanton.

       - The mere failure of the employees of a railway company to discover the presence of a trespasser at a place where, and at a time when, it was their duty to anticipate the presence of trespassers, and thereafter to take such needful and proper measures for the trespasser's protection as ordinary care might require, might amount to a lack of ordinary care but would not, in and of itself, amount to willful and wanton misconduct.

       - If the presence of a trespasser on the track at the time and place of the injury is brought about by peculiar facts and circumstances which relieve the trespasser from the guilt of a lack of ordinary care in thus exposing oneself, the company might be liable for a lack of ordinary care on its part in failing to anticipate the trespasser's presence at a time when and a place where it was charged with such duty, and in thereafter failing to take such proper precautions for the trespasser's safety as might seem reasonably necessary.

       - If a homicide occurs at a place upon the track of a railway company where it is the duty of the servants of the company to anticipate the presence of persons on the track, and their failure to so anticipate the presence of others thereon amounts to mere negligence, the negligence of the person killed, under such circumstances, amounting to the lack of ordinary care for one's safety, will prevent a recovery by a plaintiff who sues for such homicide, but if the servants of the company are guilty of willful and wanton negligence, which results in the homicide of the person killed, then the negligence of the person killed, however gross, will not defeat a recovery of damages for such homicide by a plaintiff who is entitled under the law to sue therefor.

        Contributory negligence of the plaintiff which does not equal, or exceed the negligence of the defendant does not defeat the recovery of damages but diminishes the amount thereof "in proportion to the amount of fault attributable to" the plaintiff.

       <p>

       The true comparative-negligence rule is that, if a plaintiff and defendant are both guilty of negligence which concurs proximately to bring about an injury to a plaintiff, and if the defendant's negligence is sufficient to predicate an action on, for example, ordinary negligence, and if the plaintiff is negligent, even if plaintiff's negligence amounts to a failure to exercise ordinary care, and the plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant, the plaintiff is still entitled to recover, provided the plaintiff could not have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence by the exercise of ordinary care after it was actually discovered or should have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care. Willis v. Jones, <cite class="ga_app_court">89 Ga. App. 824</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 517</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The comparative negligence rule is that where there is negligence by both parties which is concurrent and contributes to the injury sued for, a recovery by the plaintiff is not barred, but plaintiff's damages shall be diminished by an amount proportioned to the amount of fault attributable to plaintiff, provided that plaintiff's fault is less than the defendants, and that, by the exercise of ordinary care, plaintiff could not have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence after it became apparent or in the exercise of ordinary care should have been discovered by the plaintiff. Rogers v. McKinley, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 262</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 662</cite> (1934), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">52 Ga. 161</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 805</cite> (1935); Georgia Power Co. v.

       <p>
        <p>
       If the negligent acts and conduct of the complainant only proximately contribute to the injury, but in some less degree than the negligence of the defendant, plaintiff can still recover partial damages under the comparative negligence rule, unless plaintiff could have avoided the consequences of defendant's negligence after it had or should have become known.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t46c08s46-8-291" target="_self">46-8-291</a></cite>) meant that where both parties are at fault, and the alleged injury was the fault of both, and if the jury should find from the evidence that the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, could not have avoided the alleged injury caused or occasioned by the defendant's negligence, then, though the plaintiff may have been to some extent negligent, the plaintiff would be entitled to damages, but the amount shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of fault attributable to the plaintiff; but the plaintiff cannot recover if guilty of negligence contributing to the injury, unless it is made to appear that the negligence of the defendant preponderated in causing the injury.

       - If jury finds the plaintiff was negligent, and that neither plaintiff's negligence nor defendant's negligence was the sole proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries, but that plaintiff's negligence and defendant's negligence combined to cause plaintiff's injuries, and the defendant's negligence was greater than the plaintiff's, then they should find a verdict for the plaintiff in an amount calculated by determining the total amount in which plaintiff has been damaged, and then reducing that amount in proportion to the negligence of the plaintiff compared with that of the defendant. Underwood v. Atlanta &amp; W. Point R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">105 Ga. App. 340</cite>, <cite class="app_court">124 S.E.2d 758</cite>, aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 193</cite>, <cite class="app_court">126 S.E.2d 785</cite> (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Comparative negligence doctrine denies any recovery if plaintiff's negligence equals or exceeds defendant's. Damages are proportionately reduced where the latter's fault exceeds that of the plaintiff. Thus, if each party is 50 percent at fault, there can be no recovery. But should plaintiff's negligence be 49 percent, plaintiff is entitled to recover 51 percent of plaintiff's damages. Southern Ry. v. Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co., 376 F. Supp. 96 (S.D. Ga. 1974).

       Where the plaintiff by the exercise of ordinary care could have avoided the consequences to oneself caused by the defendant's negligence, plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Lowe v. Payne, <cite class="ga_court">156 Ga. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E. 924</cite> (1923).

       The plaintiff can never recover in an action for personal injuries, no matter what the negligence of the defendant may be, short of actual wantonness, when the proof shows plaintiff could, by ordinary care, after the negligence of the defendant began or was existing, have avoided the consequences to oneself of that negligence; the law of contributory negligence is applicable only where both parties are at fault, and when, also, the plaintiff could not by ordinary care have avoided the injury which the defendant's negligence produced.

       - Because the duty to avoid negligence does not arise until after the negligence is existing, and is either apparent, or the circumstances are such that an ordinarily prudent person would have reason to apprehend its existence, the doctrine that recovery cannot be had for a homicide if the deceased could by the exercise of ordinary care have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence, has no application to a case where the negligence came into existence at a time when the deceased was in such a condition that the deceased could not have done anything to avoid the consequences of the negligence.

       - It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the failure on the part of a person approaching and entering into a railroad crossing, and unaware of the approach of a train, to stop, look, and listen, renders that person guilty of the lack of ordinary care.

       - One using path across railroad track is bound to use ordinary care for one's own safety, and ordinary care in such case is that care which an ordinarily prudent person would use under similar circumstances; the absence of such care defeats recovery where the exercise of such care would have avoided the injury.

       - The use of the track by pedestrians with the company's knowledge does not bind it to the exercise of extraordinary care and diligence to protect them.

       - A lack of ordinary care on the part of a railway company in failing to anticipate presence of a trespasser does not render it liable where the trespasser was personally guilty of a lack of ordinary care in exposing oneself to such peril, but might render the company liable if the presence of the trespasser on the track at such a time and place was free from a lack of ordinary care on the trespasser's part.

        <p>
       - If the presence of a trespasser on the track at the time and place of the injury is brought about by peculiar facts and circumstances which relieve the trespasser from the guilt of a lack of ordinary care in thus exposing oneself, the company might be liable for a mere lack of ordinary care on its part in failing to anticipate the trespasser's presence at a time when and a place where it was charged with such duty, and in thereafter failing to take such proper precautions for the trespasser's safety as might seem reasonably necessary.

       - If the negligence of the defendant and the driver of a mule hitched to a buggy concurred in causing the injuries, the plaintiff could recover, provided plaintiff could not by the exercise of ordinary care have avoided being injured; and plaintiff's damages should not be diminished on account of the driver's negligence, even if such negligence amounted to the want of ordinary care on the driver's part, as the negligence of the driver could not be imputed to the plaintiff a guest of the driver.

       - Questions as to diligence and negligence, including contributory negligence, and what negligence constitutes the proximate cause of the injury are questions peculiarly for the jury, except where the solution of the question appears to be palpably clear, plain, and indisputable. Brown v. Savannah Elec. &amp; Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 773</cite> (1932); Iler v.

       <p>
        Questions of negligence, proximate cause and failure to exercise due care in avoiding the consequences of another's negligence, or where the conduct charged or relied on as negligence is such that different minds might reasonably draw different conclusions therefrom, are for the trier of facts.

       - Where, in an action for personal injury, the case turns upon the question whether the party injured could, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided the injury, and the evidence does not show such conduct on that party's part as to amount to negligence per se, the question as to the exercise of ordinary care is for the jury.

       - Where the court, in stating to the jury a number of contingencies in which the plaintiff could not recover, instructs the jury that if the negligence of the plaintiff was equal to or greater than that of the defendant the plaintiff could not recover, the charge is not error for the reason that the court failed to qualify the diminished damages rule by the provisions of former Code 1933,

       - In the trial of an action wherein the plaintiff seeks recovery of damages for injuries alleged to be due to the negligence of a railroad company at a public crossing, where the evidence authorizes a finding that the plaintiff could have avoided the negligence of the railroad company by the exercise of ordinary care, it is error for the court to refuse to give a charge on request that if the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care, could have avoided the consequences to oneself caused by defendant's negligence, plaintiff would not be entitled to recover.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - A charge that, if the plaintiff and the defendant are both at fault, the plaintiff may nevertheless recover, but the damage should be diminished in proportion to the amount of default attributable to the plaintiff, states a correct rule of law and is not subject to the objection that it contains as instruction to the jury that the plaintiff can recover, if plaintiff's negligence is equal to the negligence of the defendant.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The instruction: "If you find that the deceased and the defendant were both negligent, and then negligence of the deceased was equal to or greater than that of the defendant, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover. If you should find that both the deceased and the defendant were negligent, but that the negligence of the defendant was greater than that of the deceased, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, if otherwise entitled to recover under the rules I have given you, but in such event you would reduce the amount of the recovery in proportion to the negligence of the deceased, if she was guilty of such negligence," is not reversible error.

       - A court errs in charging the jury that, under the comparative-negligence rule and doctrine, the plaintiff would be barred from recovery if the plaintiff was guilty of a failure to exercise ordinary care before plaintiff's duty to discover and avoid the negligence of the defendant arose.

        18-607 and

   §§
   18-607, 68-710 and 94-1108 were construed alike since they contained almost the exact same language and they were intended to operate only when the facts in a case were not or could not be produced, in which event the burden was upon the railroad or bus company to produce the facts which were, as a general rule, peculiarly within its knowledge. An instruction upon the principle embraced in these sections ought not to be given where the testimony in the case sufficiently explained every material fact connected with the infliction of the injury; and these sections have served their purpose when they compel the railroad or bus company to explain how the injury occurred; and that the question of negligence or no negligence was to be decided from the facts in the case.

       - Although the strictness of pleading necessary in action in the superior and city courts is not required in justice of the peace courts, nevertheless, where an action is brought in a justice of the peace court against a railroad company for the killing of livestock, it is essential that the plaintiff should, at least in general terms, allege that the killing was the result of the negligence of the defendant company, the presumption of negligence which the law raises against a railroad company being a rule of evidence, and not of pleading, applicable as such to all actions brought against railroad companies for damage sustained by the running of their engines, cars, or other machinery.

       - When it is proved that the damage was occasioned because of the operation of trains, the presumption arises that the railroad company is liable, but the railroad company may rebut this presumption by introducing evidence to show that it was not liable; the burden of procedure is shifted from the plaintiff to the railroad company.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t46c08s46-8-292" target="_self">46-8-292</a></cite>) proof of an injury is prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the railroad company only in a case where such injury is inflicted by the running of a locomotive or cars of such company. If the proof does not disclose that the injury was inflicted by the running of a locomotive or cars of the company, then there is no prima facie evidence of want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the company.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t46c08s46-8-292" target="_self">46-8-292</a></cite> is a rebuttable presumption and disappears when the railroad company introduces evidence showing the exercise of reasonable care and skill, that is, ordinary care, by its employees in the operation of the train at the time and place in question. Gay v. Sylvania Cent. Ry., <cite class="ga_app_court">79 Ga. App. 362</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 713</cite> (1949); Houston v. Georgia N.E.R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">193 Ga.

       This is a rule of evidence, and the presumption thus created is overcome by the introduction of evidence of the exercise of reasonable care and skill on the part of the servants of the railroad at the time and place in question, and such evidence is controlling, if not discredited or contradicted, in the absence of any evidence of negligence on the part of such servants at the time and place in question.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t46c08s46-8-292" target="_self">46-8-292</a></cite>), does not have to introduce evidence showing that its servants were in the exercise of reasonable skill and care, but only has the burden of explaining how the injury occurred and producing some evidence to the contrary of the plaintiff's charges of negligence. Macon, D. &amp; S.R.R. v. Stephens, <cite class="ga_app_court">66 Ga. App. 636</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 32</cite> (1942).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the railroad offers opposing evidence as to each act of alleged negligence the statutory presumption immediately vanishes, and the plaintiff must go forward with the evidence if any more is needed to establish a preponderance of the evidence. Plaintiff does this, not because the burden of proof has been shifted to plaintiff, since such a burden never left plaintiff from the beginning of the case, but because the burden of evidence was shifted back to plaintiff. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Thomas, <cite class="ga_app_court">83 Ga. App. 477</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 301</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The prima facie presumption of want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of railroad companies which arises upon proof of injury inflicted by the running of their locomotives or cars disappears upon the introduction of some evidence showing absence of such negligence. The burden of proof then shifts to the plaintiff to show such negligence as will authorize recovery. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Carver, <cite class="ga_app_court">81 Ga.

       - This rule is merely a rule of evidence, so that the presumption thus created is overcome by the introduction by the railroad company of evidence of the exercise by it or its servants operating the train of reasonable skill and care in the performance of their duties at the particular time and place in question. Such evidence on behalf of the railroad cannot arbitrarily be disregarded in the absence of any evidence to discredit or contradict it. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v.

       - Where it is shown that injury was inflicted by the running of a railroad train, a presumption of negligence arises against the railroad, but the presumption is overcome by evidence on behalf of the railroad showing the exercise of ordinary and reasonable care and skill, and, in the absence of any evidence to discredit or contradict this evidence, or showing negligence on the part of servants of the railroad, it is controlling, and a verdict for the plaintiff is unauthorized.

       - Where relying entirely upon the presumption of negligence against railroad companies the plaintiff shows that one of plaintiff's cows had been killed by the defendant company's train, and the presumption is overcome by the uncontradicted evidence of the engineer that the weather was so foggy that it was impossible for the engineer to have seen the animal in time to avoid killing it, in the absence of anything to discredit or contradict such evidence a verdict was demanded for the railroad company.

       - In a parent's action against a railroad for the death of a child, after it was shown that the child was killed by the railroad's engine, the burden of evidence was upon the railroad to disprove its negligence and introduce proof that it was not negligent in the particulars alleged in the complaint.

       - In an action against a carrier for wrongful death of a passenger due to negligent operation of a bus, the judge should instruct the jury that the duty of the driver to exercise extraordinary care continued in all events, whether or not the jury believed that the driver was confronted with a sudden emergency, but that if they should conclude that a sudden emergency did arise, in deciding whether the driver continued to exercise extraordinary care they should take into consideration the fact that when one is confronted with a sudden emergency one is not to be held to the same accuracy of judgment as would be required of the person if one had time for deliberation.

      Whenever any railroad company incorporated under the laws of this state or whose line of road may extend into this state has leased its line of road to any person and such lessee is in possession of the road, service on such lessor company may be perfected by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the president or other officer of the lessor company; provided, however, that if service cannot be had in this manner, then service may be made upon such company by delivering to the Secretary of State two copies of the summons and complaint, one copy of which shall be mailed by the Secretary of State to the lessor company at its last known address according to the Secretary of State. In addition, the plaintiff shall cause a copy of the summons and complaint to be served upon the lessee by the sheriff of the county where the action is brought or by his deputy or by the marshal or his deputy.

      Nothing in this article shall be construed as depriving the commission of jurisdiction over interurban railroad companies or limiting its powers in any way, but all of the laws of this state which apply to railroads in general, and to street and suburban railroads in particular, shall, as far as applicable or appropriate, apply to interurban railroads, unless interurban railroads are expressly excluded from the provisions of such laws by the terms thereof. The benefits of this article shall extend to all companies incorporated in this state prior to August 19, 1916, with the power to build or operate electric street and suburban railroads and which, as of August 19, 1916, were operating street and suburban railroads partly in an incorporated city and extending through the country to another incorporated city, including those railroads which run between an incorporated city in Georgia and an incorporated city in an adjoining state. Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair any valid, subsisting contract existing as of August 16, 1921, between any municipality and any railroad company or any street or interurban railroad company. Nothing in this article shall operate to repeal any municipal ordinance existing as of August 16, 1921.

       - There is, doubtless, a distinction between an act of God and an unavoidable accident.

       - If shipment is delayed by request of shipper, liability of carrier is only that of warehouseman during such delay, and carrier cannot be charged with the loss of the goods if, while they were in the carrier's custody pending instruction from the shipper, the carrier exercised ordinary care.

       - If a common carrier receives goods into the carrier's own warehouse for the accommodation of oneself and one's customers, so that the deposit there is a mere accessory to the carriage and for the purpose of facilitating it, the carrier's liability as a carrier will commence with the receipt of the goods; but, on the contrary, if the goods when so deposited are not ready for immediate transportation, and the carrier cannot make arrangements for their carriage to the place of destination until something further is done, or some further direction is given or communication made concerning them by the owner, or consignor, the deposit must be considered to be in the meantime for the carrier's convenience and accommodation, and the receiver, until some change takes place, will be responsible only as a warehouseman.

       <p>
        - Shipper seeking to recover damages of common carrier must show some injury which cannot be the result of inherent nature or defects of goods shipped, or some carelessness or negligence on the part of the carrier likely to cause the injury, before the burden is cast on the carrier to show that the carrier is not in fault. Hussey v. Saragossa, 12 F. Cas. 1066 (S.D. Ga. 1876).

       <p>

       To make out case for damage to goods, the shipper need only show the delivery in good condition and the receipt in damaged condition; the carrier, to make good the carrier's defense must then show that the damage arose from causes unmixed with any negligence on the carrier's part.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - If a common carrier relies upon the defense that the loss was occasioned by the fault of the shipper or the shipper's agent, the carrier must bring oneself within the defense by negativing contributing fault on the carrier's own part. Bugg v. Perry &amp; Faircloth, <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 523</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 708</cite> (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where it appears that the injury resulted solely from the fault of the shipper in improperly packing the merchandise the rule is that if the defendant defends on the ground that the shipper is guilty of negligence in improper packing, the burden is on the carrier not only to show that the loss was occasioned by such fault on the part of the shipper but the carrier must negative any contributing fault on the carrier's own part. Loo-Mac Freight Lines v. American Type Founders, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">100 Ga. App. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">110 S.E.2d 566</cite> (1959).

        <p>
       - Injury from inherent qualities is somewhat in nature of damages resulting from act of God; and in the more recent development of the rules as to the liability of carriers it has been held that they are not liable for loss or damage due to the intrinsic qualities of the goods carried. Forrester v. Georgia R.R. &amp; Banking, <cite class="ga_court">92 Ga. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E. 811</cite> (1893); Susong v.

        <p>
       - The carrier's right of defense for a failure to deliver goods of a perishable nature entrusted to the carrier's care, or where the carrier delivered them in a damaged condition, has been so enlarged that the carrier may show that the damage was occasioned by an inherent vice or natural deterioration in the goods.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When goods, though perishable or liable to rapidly deteriorate from internal causes, are damaged while in the hands of the carrier, the burden of proof is upon the carrier to show either that the carrier was free from negligence, or that notwithstanding the carrier's negligence the damage occurred without the carrier's fault; that is, that the carrier's negligence did not contribute to the damage.

The burden, however, is on the plaintiff to show the loss; but for the purposes of a prima facie case this may be done by showing such circumstances as would create the inference against the defendant that the goods were lost; as, for instance, they were bailed to the carrier a sufficient length of time to be transported to destination and have not arrived there.

        <p>
       - Even if the commission, after fixing a rate or charge, subsequently determines that the rate was unreasonably high, it has no authority in the revision of the rate to require that refunds or reparations be made of collections under the rate which had been established. If, after fixing a rate which the commission determines to be just and reasonable, it decides that the rate is unreasonable or unjust, it has the right under the law at any time to revise or amend its rulings or orders but, like legislation in general, these revised orders look to the future, and cannot be applied retroactively.

     <p>
      The commission is required to fix and prescribe a schedule of maximum rates and charges for storage of freight to be made and charged by railroad companies doing business in this state, and to fix at what time after the receipt of freight at place of destination such charges for storage shall begin. The commission shall have the power to vary such rates and charges according to the value and character of the freight stored, the nature of the place of destination, the residence of the consignee, and such other facts as in its judgment should be considered in fixing the same. All of the provisions of this title prescribing the procedure to be followed by the commission in fixing freight and passenger tariffs, hearing complaints of carriers and shippers, and altering and amending freight and passenger tariffs shall apply to the subject of fixing and amending rates and charges for storage.

       <p>
        <p>
       - It is the duty of a railroad company to provide facilities for the transportation of goods, but this duty is not an absolute one, the company must furnish cars sufficient to transport goods offered in the usual and ordinary course of business, but it is not bound to anticipate and prepare for an unexpected press of business. Central of Ga. Ry. v. George P. Greene &amp; Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">41 Ga. App. 794</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 809</cite> (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ordinarily a shipper, on reasonable demand, would be entitled to all the cars which it could promptly load with freight to be transported over the carrier's line. But that is not an absolute right, and the carrier is not liable if its failure to furnish cars was the result of sudden and great demands which it had no reason to apprehend would be made, and which it could not reasonably have been expected to meet in full. Central of Ga. Ry. v. George P. Greene &amp; Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">41 Ga. App. 794</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 809</cite> (1930).

       - There may be things of such an unusual character that a railroad company is not bound, under its general duty as a common carrier, to provide cars or special facilities for their transportation. But if in the ordinary course of its business it is accustomed to receive lumber which requires cars 40 feet in length for transportation, or holds itself out as a common carrier thereof, the duty to furnish cars for that purpose arises.

       - Granting that the defendant railroad company could relieve itself from liability by showing that every possible effort was promptly made to secure other employees in lieu of those who had violated their obligations to their employer by striking, the proof offered fell far short of due diligence in this respect. If the company's engineers wrongfully refused to do their duty, certainly it was incumbent upon the railroad officials to discharge them and use every endeavor to secure new men who were competent and willing to perform the services they ought to have rendered. It did not appear that the officers of the company made any attempt whatever to do this; and however great their embarrassment may have been, if they voluntarily elected, for any cause, to retain in the service of the company employees who openly and willfully refused to properly attend to the duties devolving upon them, the company must be held answerable for any loss to its patrons which they may have suffered in consequence.

         General rule stated.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The general rule is that the measure of damages for unreasonable delay by a common carrier in the delivery of goods shipped is the difference between their market value when they should have been delivered and their market value when they were delivered, with interest from the former date, less the freight, if unpaid. Mere unreasonable delay in transporting does not amount to conversion, so as to authorize the consignee, upon the arrival of the goods, to reject them and sue for their full value. The owner's remedy is to sue for the damages the owner has sustained by reason of the delay. Atlanta Coast Line R.R. v. Tifton Produce Co., <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 624</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E. 624</cite> (1934), answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The correct measure of damage is ordinarily the difference in the market value of the fruit at the point of shipment at the time the cars should have been furnished, and at the time they were actually furnished. Central of Ga. Ry. v. George P. Greene &amp; Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">41 Ga. App. 794</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 809</cite> (1930).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where at the time of trial shipper had recovered the goods, the measure of its damages would be that for failure of the carrier to deliver the goods within a reasonable time, i.e., the difference between the market value at the time and place they should have been delivered and the market value at the time of actual delivery. The fact that the shipment on which the carrier claimed a lien was eventually returned to the shipper by court order before trial, and that shipper was able to sell it, would be relevant only in mitigation of the damages.

        Carrier liable for delivery of goods within reasonable time.
       
       Reception of goods to be carried makes carrier liable for their safe custody and transportation within a reasonable time; if the carrier would relieve oneself from liability, the carrier should, by proof, show such facts as may be necessary for that purpose.

       - If a common carrier receives goods into the carrier's own warehouse for the accommodation of oneself and the carrier's customers, so that the deposit there is a mere accessory to the carriage and for the purpose of facilitating it, the carrier's liability as a carrier will commence with the receipt of the goods; but, on the contrary, if the goods when so deposited are not ready for immediate transportation, and the carrier cannot make arrangements for their carriage to the place of destination until something further is done, or some further direction is given or communication made concerning them by the owner, or consignor, the deposit must be considered to be in the meantime for the carrier's convenience and accommodation, and the receiver, until some change takes place, will be responsible only as a warehouseman.

       - As a general rule a railroad company is responsible as common carrier only for the safe deposit of goods shipped by freight upon the platform or in the warehouse of the road at the end of their transit, there to await delivery to the consignee when the consignee should call for them; and from the time of such deposit, even without notice by the carrier to the consignee, the liability of the railway is usually changed from that of a common carrier to that of a warehouseman.

       - The law nowhere imposes upon common carriers the obligation of notifying consignees of the arrival of their freight at the point of destination; provided, it has arrived in the due course of transportation. Southwestern R.R. v. Felder, <cite class="ga_court">46 Ga. 433</cite> (1872); Georgia &amp; A. Ry. v. Pound, <cite class="ga_court">111 Ga. 6</cite>, <cite class="app_court">36 S.E. 312</cite> (1900).

        <p>
       If goods arrive out of time, and after they have been demanded by the consignee, it might require notice of their arrival to the consignee, and a reasonable time after, to relieve the company from the extraordinary liability imposed by law upon a common carrier. Southwestern R.R. v. Felder, <cite class="ga_court">46 Ga. 433</cite> (1872).

       - Where a railroad company has transported a carload of goods and notified the consignee of their arrival, the delivery is complete when the agent of the consignee verifies the goods in the car and gives a receipt for the same; and where the agent of the consignee removes most of the goods, but leaves some in the car on account of approaching night, and the car is broken open after having been closed and sealed by the agent of the railroad company, and some of the goods stolen therefrom, the railroad company, if liable at all, is liable only for gross neglect, as a gratuitous bailee.

       - Duty to exercise care in providing necessary refrigeration is in no way dependent on express contract imposing it, and the carrier's liability is not affected by the fact that the bill of lading is silent on the subject. Unless such duty is voluntarily assumed by the shipper, if the class of goods shipped requires refrigeration for their preservation, it is the duty of the carrier to provide a supply of ice sufficient for the purpose, and it will be liable for damages resulting for nonperformance.

       - Carrier's liability for insufficient icing is not affected by shipper's discovery that cars were insufficiently iced if the shipper had no opportunity to remedy the situation, and it believed that the goods would reach their destination without injury, or if the shipper called the attention of the carrier's agent to the fact that the cars were insufficiently iced and was assured that sufficient ice would be furnished.

       - It is legal duty of common carrier to receive and transport person who has purchased ticket over its lines, to the destination called for by the ticket, and should a carrier, in violation of the duty so imposed upon it, illegally expel a passenger from its bus and wrongfully refuse to carry the passenger to the passenger's destination, it would be liable to the passenger for damages proximately resulting therefrom.

        <p>
       - While a person who has purchased a ticket for transportation over the lines of a common carrier has the right to use the facilities of the carrier to that end, it is a sine quo non to the exercise of that right that upon boarding the conveyance of the carrier, the passenger deliver to the person in charge thereof the ticket, and where the same is returned to the passenger, to produce it upon demand at reasonable times thereafter during the journey; unless the failure to produce the ticket is due to the fault of the carrier, the passenger may be ejected and further transportation refused in the absence of an offer to pay the passenger's fare.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Ordinarily carrier of passengers discharges its legal duty when it deposits passenger at a usual and reasonably safe place for alighting and crossing the street, and is under no obligation to wait until approaching automobiles have stopped, or to warn the passengers of the usual dangers of traffic, which in the passenger's exercise of ordinary care would be avoidable. But a carrier is not permitted to deposit a passenger at a place which it knows will reasonably expose the passenger to unusual and unnecessary peril, and it may be held liable for a proximately resulting injury.

       - Upon proof of injury to a passenger of a railroad company by the running of its locomotive, cars, or other machinery, or by any person in its employment and service, the law raises a presumption that the injury was caused by the negligence of the company. Douthitt v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., <cite class="ga_court">136 Ga. 351</cite>, <cite class="app_court">71 S.E. 470</cite> (1911). See also Central R.R. v.

       <p>
        <p>
       When a passenger is injured, a legal presumption that the carrier failed to exercise extraordinary care arises in the passenger's favor. The carrier can, of course, rebut this presumption by making it appear that extraordinary care and diligence was exercised. This is a jury question. Eason v. Crews, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In an action by a passenger against a street-railway company on account of a personal injury, after a presumption of negligence arises from the evidence, in order to rebut it the defendant must make it appear from the evidence that its agents or servants exercised extraordinary care and diligence in connection with those things in which it was charged that its negligence consisted. Brunswick &amp; A.R.R. v. Gale, <cite class="ga_court">56 Ga. 322</cite> (1876); Georgia Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v.

        <p>
       Where an injury to a passenger is proved to have been caused by a company's negligence, the presumption against the company will not be rebutted by the company showing that it exercised only ordinary care and diligence; as railroad companies are bound to use extraordinary care and diligence for the safety of passengers by reason of former Code 1882,

       - Where relation of carrier and passenger is once established, it continues until passenger is safely deposited at passenger's point of destination, and until the passenger has left or has had a reasonable time within which to leave the cab of the carrier; and if, during the continuance of this relation, the passenger suffers an injury in consequence of the negligent, wrongful or wanton tort of the carrier's driver, the carrier is liable. Co-op Cab Co. v. Singleton, <cite class="ga_app_court">66 Ga. App. 874</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 541</cite> (1942); Southeastern Greyhound Corp. v.

       The relationship of carrier and passenger exists until the passenger's destination has been reached and the passenger has either alighted from the means of conveyance in safety or has been afforded reasonable time and opportunity to do so.

       <p>
        <p>
       The relationship of carrier and passenger terminates when the passenger has been safely discharged and when the carrier is no longer bound to exercise extraordinary care for the passenger's safety, but is bound to use only the same degree of care for the passenger's safety as it would for the safety of any other member of the public upon its premises by invitation, express or implied. Delta Air Lines v. Millirons, <cite class="ga_app_court">87 Ga. App. 334</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E.2d 598</cite> (1952).

       Carrier's duty to exercise extraordinary care for the safety of its passengers continues until the passenger has been conducted to a place where the passenger has some freedom of locomotion and can in a measure look out for the passenger's own safety.

       - Plaintiff, in a suit seeking damages for injuries which occurred when plaintiff was struck by a train at a station, failed to come forward with any evidence rebutting the affidavits of the train's operators showing that they did nothing to breach their duty of care, i.e., each operator averred that the operator had been trained "to be extremely alert and to maintain a constant visual check of conditions as far ahead as possible" when entering and leaving the station and "to visually scan the entire station area, including the platforms and the track itself," and that the operator had done so upon entering and leaving the station on the morning in question and had observed nothing unusual.

       - Failure to instruct the jury that a cab driver could assume that the driver of the other car would obey the law of right of way was not error, as extraordinary diligence might, in the opinion of the jury, require that the driver should look out for law violators as one of the perils which might interfere with the driver's safe transit, and it was a question for the jury to determine what extraordinary diligence demanded. Black &amp; White Cab Co. v. Clark, <cite class="ga_app_court">67 Ga. App. 170</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 570</cite> (1942).

        <p>
       In an action against a carrier for wrongful death of a passenger due to negligent operation of a bus, the judge should instruct the jury that the duty of the driver to exercise extraordinary care continued in all events, whether or not the jury believed that the driver was confronted with a sudden emergency, but that if they should conclude that a sudden emergency did arise, in deciding whether the driver continued to exercise extraordinary care they should take into consideration the fact that when one is confronted with a sudden emergency the driver is not to be held to the same accuracy of judgment as would be required of the driver if the driver had time for deliberation. Scott v. Torrance, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 309</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 120</cite> (1943).

       - Where one employed generally by a railroad is issued trip passes on trains to go to and from work, and is also permitted to ride without the payment of fare without using one's pass, and is not engaged in or within the scope of one's employment while so riding on a train, the employee occupies the status of a passenger for hire, and the railroad is liable to the employee for injuries inflicted by its negligence, while the employee is so riding, and if the injury occurs at a time when the employee is using a pass a limitation therein relieving the railroad from liability on account of its negligence is void.

       - A carrier who receives a passenger on one of its freight trains is bound by the same standard of diligence as if the passenger were being transported on a regular passenger-train.

       A passenger who voluntarily seeks to be transported on a freight-train takes the risk of the usual and necessary jolts and jars which occur in the operation of such train, but the carrier is not relieved from the use of extraordinary diligence to the passenger to prevent unusual and unnecessary jolts and jars.

       The rates of freight fixed by the commission must be observed; and if a lower rate of freight than that allowed by the Railroad Commission (now Public Service Commission) is collected, an action to recover the remainder of the true amount is maintainable, even though the consignee accepted the freight and paid the smaller amount in good faith, and although in the consignee's dealings with the consignee's customers the consignee has conducted the consignee's business upon the basis of the rate of freight collected.
