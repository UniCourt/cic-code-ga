     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that the State of Georgia became the owner of the beds of all tidewaters within the jurisdiction of the State of Georgia as successor to the Crown of England and by the common law.The State of Georgia continues to hold title to the beds of all tidewaters within the state, except where title in a private party can be traced to a valid Crown or state grant which explicitly conveyed the beds of such tidewaters.The General Assembly further finds that the State of Georgia, as sovereign, is trustee of the rights of the people of the state to use and enjoy all tidewaters which are capable of use for fishing, passage, navigation, commerce, and transportation, pursuant to the common law public trust doctrine. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the protection of tidewaters for use by the state and its citizens has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and, consequently, is properly a matter for regulation under the police powers of the state.The General Assembly further finds and declares that structures located upon tidewaters which are used as places of habitation, dwelling, sojournment, or residence interfere with the state's proprietary interest or the public trust, or both, and must be removed to ensure the rights of the state and the people of the State of Georgia to the use and enjoyment of such tidewaters.It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this article to protect the tidewaters of the state by authorizing the commissioner of natural resources to remove or require removal of certain structures from such tidewaters in accordance with the procedures and within the timetable set forth in this article.

      The General Assembly finds and declares that by the common law the citizens of this state have an inherent right to use as highways all navigable streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year and that this right of use extends to the entire surface of the stream or river from bank to bank.The General Assembly further finds that the common law regarding such right of use has not been modified by statute nor is it incompatible with the federal or state constitutions. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that ensuring the right of use by all the citizens of this state of navigable streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year as highways has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and, consequently, is properly a matter for regulation under the police powers of the state.The General Assembly further finds and declares that structures located upon navigable streams and rivers which are used as places of habitation, dwelling, sojournment, or residence interfere with the citizens' right to use the entire surface of such streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year from bank to bank as highways and must be removed to ensure the rights of the citizens of this state to such usage.It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this article to ensure such rights of the citizens of this state by authorizing the commissioner of natural resources to remove or require removal of certain structures from such streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year in accordance with the procedures and within the timetable set forth in this article.

      In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign revenues and earnings to be received. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to the purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. The indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, the trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project or projects affected by the indenture.

      It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to provide for the construction and maintenance by the United States government of the intracoastal waterway and its salt-water tributaries, hereinafter referred to as the intracoastal waterway, from the state boundary line in the Savannah River to the state boundary line in Cumberland Sound, as authorized by the Congress of the United States by the River and Harbor Act approved June 20, 1938, authorizing the construction of the intracoastal waterway to a depth of 12 feet from the Savannah River, Georgia, to Cumberland Sound, Georgia, in accordance with the project described in House Document No. 618, Seventy-fifth Congress, third session, and subject to the conditions set forth in said document, and by the River and Harbor Act approved August 26, 1937, authorizing the construction of a protected route as part of the intracoastal waterway, around St. Andrew Sound, Georgia, to a depth of seven feet in accordance with the project described in Senate Committee Print, Seventy-fourth Congress, first session, and subject to the conditions set forth in that document. The Governor and the Secretary of State are authorized to issue to the United States of America a grant or grants of a perpetual right and easement to enter upon, cut away, and remove any and all of the land, including submerged lands, composing a part of the channel rights of way, anchorage areas, and turning basins as may be required at any time for construction and maintenance of the intracoastal waterway and to maintain the portions excavated, thereby created as a part of the navigable waters of the United States. The Governor and the Secretary of State are authorized to issue to the United States of America a further perpetual right and easement to enter upon, occupy, and use any portion of the land, including submerged land, composing a part of the spoil disposal area not so cut away and converted into public navigable waters described in this Code section, for the deposit of dredged material and for such other purposes as may be needed in the construction, maintenance, and improvement of the intracoastal waterway, insofar as such lands, including submerged lands, are subject to grant by the State of Georgia. The grant is to be issued upon a certificate showing the location and description of the rights of way and spoil disposal areas furnished to the Governor by the secretary of the army or by any authorized officer of the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army or by any other authorized official exercising control over the construction or maintenance of the projects.

      The directors may require the subscribers to the capital stock to pay the amounts variously subscribed by them in such installments as they may deem proper. The directors may receive cash or property, real or personal, at the agreed value thereof in the payment of such installments. If any subscriber shall neglect to pay any installments as required by resolution of the board of directors, the directors may direct an action to be brought against him forthwith for the amount of the call. Alternatively, after 30 days' notice to the stockholder, the board of directors may, in its discretion, cause his stock to be sold at auction to the highest bidder for cash. Any deficiency in the sum thus realized necessary to make the amount of the call shall be made good by the delinquent. Any surplus over the amount of the call and the expenses of the sale shall be paid over to him. A certificate of stock shall be issued to the purchaser and he shall stand in the same relation to the company as the delinquent would have, had he not so made default. Such sale shall be in the city or other place where the principal office of the company is located, at such time and place as the directors may prescribe. If for any reason it is not practicable to serve the delinquent stockholder with notice of the sale, personally or by mail, or if he is a nonresident of this state, then notice may be given him of the sale by publication in the newspaper in which sheriff's advertisements are published in the county of its principal office, once a week for four weeks prior to the date of the sale.

The company shall state in the petition that it desires to amend its charter by having granted to it the corporate powers and privileges granted to other navigation companies by this chapter. The company shall also file along with the petition a certified abstract from the minutes of the corporation, showing that the application for amendment has been authorized by resolution which has been duly adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon of the corporation at a meeting held for the purpose of passing upon the resolution duly certified by the president and secretary of the corporation.

When such petition is filed, the Secretary of State shall issue to the person, under the great seal of the state, a certificate setting forth that this person is a body corporate with all the powers, duties, and liabilities of this chapter.

     <p>
      In any case where a pilot is suspended or the pilot's license is revoked or where a fine exceeding $150.00 is imposed by the commissioners on a pilot or any other person, the pilot or other person concerned may petition the judge of the superior court of the county where the judgment or sentence of the commissioners was made, setting forth on oath the circumstances of the case. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the chairperson or secretary of the commissioners at least three days before the petition is presented and the commissioners shall be entitled to be heard as to whether there is sufficient ground for the allowance of an appeal. If the judge of the superior court should think there is sufficient ground for the allowance of an appeal, such judge shall issue an order directing an issue to be made between the appellant and the commissioners, which issue shall be tried by a jury at the next term of the superior court, unless good cause is shown for a continuance. If, at the trial, a verdict should be rendered in favor of the appellant, the judge of the superior court shall order that the fine be remitted, that the suspension be canceled, or that the license be restored. Either the appellant or the commissioners may move the court for a new trial and may appeal to the Court of Appeals from the court's order entered upon the motion, as is provided by law in cases of appeal from orders granting or refusing a new trial in common-law cases.

The General Assembly further recognizes the importance of wildlife related recreation and the need to provide greater opportunities for such recreation and public lands in the face of rapid woodland development and appropriation of existing wildlife habitat. The General Assembly further declares its intent to ensure that the funding provided by hunters and fishermen through the payment of these license fee increases and changes will fund the acquisition of fish and wildlife habitat and public recreational areas.

George Reservoir, Lake Blue Ridge, and West Point Lake, it is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare to prohibit the discharge of sewage from such vessels into the waters of such lakes.

       ARTICLE III. FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY, AND PURPOSE
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       a)Party states find that:
      </h5>
      <p>
       Boating activities are managed for the benefit of all residents and visitors;
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefits of boating activities can be materially affected by the degree that a citation is answered, through appearance at a court, magistrate, or tribunal and the payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any;
      </p>
      <p>
       The management of boating activities contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of party states;
      </p>
      <p>
       Boating activities are valuable without regard to political boundaries. Therefore, all persons should be required to comply with boating laws of party states as a condition precedent to the privilege to operate;
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of boating laws interferes with the management of boating activities and may endanger the safety of persons and property;
      </p>
      <p>
       The mobility of people who violate boating laws necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among party states;
      </p>
      <p>
       In most instances, when an issuing state is a location other than a home state, a person:
      </p>
      <p>
       Promote adherence to boating laws and have a citation answered through a court, magistrate, or tribunal appearance and the payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any;
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognize that any revocation, denial, or withdrawal of any license by a party state should be treated the same in all states, territories, and possessions of the United States, including the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow violators to accept a citation, except as provided in subsection (b) of Article IV of this compact, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the violator is a resident where the citation was issued, provided that the home state of the violator is a party state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against a person whose home state was not the issuing state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow a home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for its residents which occurred in a party state as if they had occurred in the home state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among party states for having citations which are issued in a party state answered through court, magistrate, or tribunal appearances and the payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any;
      </p>
      <p>
       Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of boating violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide a means through which party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of a person issued a citation within a party state in recognition of such person's right of due process and the sovereign status of such party state.

      The General Assembly recognizes the need for maintaining navigation inlets, harbors, and rivers to promote commercial and recreational uses of our coastal waters and their resources. The General Assembly further recognizes that dredging activities to deepen or maintain navigation channels within tidal inlets, as well as the entrances to harbors and rivers, often alter the natural drift of sand resources within the littoral zone. This alteration can be exacerbated when the sand resources are deposited in designated upland or offshore disposal areas instead of being returned to the natural river-sand transport-beach system. This alteration can adversely impact natural resources, recreation, tourism, and associated coastal economies. Moreover, the General Assembly believes in the duties of government to protect life and property. Therefore, it is the policy of this state that there shall be no net loss of sand from the state's coastal barrier beaches resulting from dredging activities to deepen or maintain navigation channels within tidal inlets, as well as the entrances to harbors and rivers.
