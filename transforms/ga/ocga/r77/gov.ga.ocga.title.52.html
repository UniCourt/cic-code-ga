     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that the State of Georgia became the owner of the beds of all tidewaters within the jurisdiction of the State of Georgia as successor to the Crown of England and by the common law.The State of Georgia continues to hold title to the beds of all tidewaters within the state, except where title in a private party can be traced to a valid Crown or state grant which explicitly conveyed the beds of such tidewaters.The General Assembly further finds that the State of Georgia, as sovereign, is trustee of the rights of the people of the state to use and enjoy all tidewaters which are capable of use for fishing, passage, navigation, commerce, and transportation, pursuant to the common law public trust doctrine. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the protection of tidewaters for use by the state and its citizens has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and, consequently, is properly a matter for regulation under the police powers of the state.The General Assembly further finds and declares that structures located upon tidewaters which are used as places of habitation, dwelling, sojournment, or residence interfere with the state's proprietary interest or the public trust, or both, and must be removed to ensure the rights of the state and the people of the State of Georgia to the use and enjoyment of such tidewaters.It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this article to protect the tidewaters of the state by authorizing the commissioner of natural resources to remove or require removal of certain structures from such tidewaters in accordance with the procedures and within the timetable set forth in this article.

      The General Assembly finds and declares that by the common law the citizens of this state have an inherent right to use as highways all navigable streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year and that this right of use extends to the entire surface of the stream or river from bank to bank.The General Assembly further finds that the common law regarding such right of use has not been modified by statute nor is it incompatible with the federal or state constitutions. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that ensuring the right of use by all the citizens of this state of navigable streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year as highways has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and, consequently, is properly a matter for regulation under the police powers of the state.The General Assembly further finds and declares that structures located upon navigable streams and rivers which are used as places of habitation, dwelling, sojournment, or residence interfere with the citizens' right to use the entire surface of such streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year from bank to bank as highways and must be removed to ensure the rights of the citizens of this state to such usage.It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this article to ensure such rights of the citizens of this state by authorizing the commissioner of natural resources to remove or require removal of certain structures from such streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year in accordance with the procedures and within the timetable set forth in this article.

      Whenever any order issued by the commissioner pursuant to Code Section 52-1-34 becomes final or whenever any order adverse to the owner or possessor of a structure issued by the administrative law judge pursuant to Code Section 52-1-35 becomes final by being unappealed or affirmed upon appeal, the structure shall be deemed contraband.Upon the structure's becoming contraband, the commissioner or his duly authorized agents shall seize and remove said structure and may sell or dispose of such structure in such manner as the commissioner may direct; provided, however, that prior to such seizure the commissioner shall securely post a notice in a conspicuous place on the structure and, if the address of any person or persons claiming ownership of or any person or persons in possession of the structure is known, the commissioner shall mail a copy of such notice to such person or persons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery informing such person or persons claiming ownership of or in possession of the structure that such structure is considered contraband as a matter of law and that unless the structure is removed within 30 days of the date of the notice, the commissioner, through his duly appointed agents, shall seize and remove said structure and may sell or dispose of such structure in such manner as the commissioner may direct.Any such notice so posted must be protected from the weather by encasing same in a weatherproof, transparent material.In the event the commissioner sells the structure or the materials of such structure, he may credit and retain the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal and disposal of the structure and any remaining balance shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the general fund.

The authority shall have the power to sell any portions of land or improvements, or both, thus conveyed as are not required for port or warehouse operations or for the future expansion or improvement of the operation of a system of state docks, provided that any moneys received incident to such sales shall be utilized by the authority for the further expansion, construction, and improvement of the existing facilities located at the Medical Depot site in Chatham County on the Savannah River. The authority is empowered to borrow money on the existing facilities as described in this Code section and to issue revenue anticipation certificates to be retired from the revenue derived from the described facilities. All such sums, whether borrowed or secured through the sale of revenue anticipation certificates, shall be used for the exclusive purpose of developing a system of state docks at the site of the Medical Depot described in this Code section or for the purchase of necessary and essential equipment to be located thereon, or both, and for any and all purposes deemed necessary, essential, and expedient for the purpose of developing the site as a part of a system of state docks.

      It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to provide for the construction and maintenance by the United States government of the intracoastal waterway and its salt-water tributaries, hereinafter referred to as the intracoastal waterway, from the state boundary line in the Savannah River to the state boundary line in Cumberland Sound, as authorized by the Congress of the United States by the River and Harbor Act approved June 20, 1938, authorizing the construction of the intracoastal waterway to a depth of 12 feet from the Savannah River, Georgia, to Cumberland Sound, Georgia, in accordance with the project described in House Document No. 618, Seventy-fifth Congress, third session, and subject to the conditions set forth in said document, and by the River and Harbor Act approved August 26, 1937, authorizing the construction of a protected route as part of the intracoastal waterway, around St. Andrew Sound, Georgia, to a depth of seven feet in accordance with the project described in Senate Committee Print, Seventy-fourth Congress, first session, and subject to the conditions set forth in that document. The Governor and the Secretary of State are authorized to issue to the United States of America a grant or grants of a perpetual right and easement to enter upon, cut away, and remove any and all of the land, including submerged lands, composing a part of the channel rights of way, anchorage areas, and turning basins as may be required at any time for construction and maintenance of the intracoastal waterway and to maintain the portions excavated, thereby created as a part of the navigable waters of the United States. The Governor and the Secretary of State are authorized to issue to the United States of America a further perpetual right and easement to enter upon, occupy, and use any portion of the land, including submerged land, composing a part of the spoil disposal area not so cut away and converted into public navigable waters described in this Code section, for the deposit of dredged material and for such other purposes as may be needed in the construction, maintenance, and improvement of the intracoastal waterway, insofar as such lands, including submerged lands, are subject to grant by the State of Georgia. The grant is to be issued upon a certificate showing the location and description of the rights of way and spoil disposal areas furnished to the Governor by the secretary of the army or by any authorized officer of the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army or by any other authorized official exercising control over the construction or maintenance of the projects.

      The directors may require the subscribers to the capital stock to pay the amounts variously subscribed by them in such installments as they may deem proper. The directors may receive cash or property, real or personal, at the agreed value thereof in the payment of such installments. If any subscriber shall neglect to pay any installments as required by resolution of the board of directors, the directors may direct an action to be brought against him forthwith for the amount of the call. Alternatively, after 30 days' notice to the stockholder, the board of directors may, in its discretion, cause his stock to be sold at auction to the highest bidder for cash. Any deficiency in the sum thus realized necessary to make the amount of the call shall be made good by the delinquent. Any surplus over the amount of the call and the expenses of the sale shall be paid over to him. A certificate of stock shall be issued to the purchaser and he shall stand in the same relation to the company as the delinquent would have, had he not so made default. Such sale shall be in the city or other place where the principal office of the company is located, at such time and place as the directors may prescribe. If for any reason it is not practicable to serve the delinquent stockholder with notice of the sale, personally or by mail, or if he is a nonresident of this state, then notice may be given him of the sale by publication in the newspaper in which sheriff's advertisements are published in the county of its principal office, once a week for four weeks prior to the date of the sale.

The company shall state in the petition that it desires to amend its charter by having granted to it the corporate powers and privileges granted to other navigation companies by this chapter. The company shall also file along with the petition a certified abstract from the minutes of the corporation, showing that the application for amendment has been authorized by resolution which has been duly adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon of the corporation at a meeting held for the purpose of passing upon the resolution duly certified by the president and secretary of the corporation.

       When a navigation company amends its charter by following the procedures specified in subsection (a) of this Code section, it may retain its original organization and the same amount of capital stock and other rights and privileges provided for in the original charter, except the right of exemption from taxation, which may not be in conflict with this chapter or any other law of this state relating to the powers and privileges of navigation corporations; and such amendments shall be without prejudice to any of the prior rights or contracts of the corporation.

       This chapter may also be adopted by any person owning or operating a navigation business, without prejudice to such organization as may already have existed and without prejudice to his existing contracts and obligations. Whenever any person desires to adopt the provisions of this chapter as provided in this subsection, he shall file a petition with the Secretary of State setting forth with particularity in what manner it is desired to adopt this chapter. When such petition is filed, the Secretary of State shall issue to the person, under the great seal of the state, a certificate setting forth that this person is a body corporate with all the powers, duties, and liabilities of this chapter. Before the certificate shall be issued, the petitioner shall pay to the Secretary of State the fee provided in Code Section 14-4-183.

If the judge of the superior court should think there is sufficient ground for the allowance of an appeal, such judge shall issue an order directing an issue to be made between the appellant and the commissioners, which issue shall be tried by a jury at the next term of the superior court, unless good cause is shown for a continuance. If, at the trial, a verdict should be rendered in favor of the appellant, the judge of the superior court shall order that the fine be remitted, that the suspension be canceled, or that the license be restored. Either the appellant or the commissioners may move the court for a new trial and may appeal to the Court of Appeals from the court's order entered upon the motion, as is provided by law in cases of appeal from orders granting or refusing a new trial in common-law cases.

       Every vessel shall be equipped with and carry aboard, at all times, at least one Type I, II, III, or V (hybrid) personal flotation device for each person on board; provided, however, that Type V (hybrid) devices are acceptable only when worn and securely fastened. In addition to the individual personal flotation device, each vessel 16 feet or more in length, except for canoes and kayaks, must at all times be equipped with at least one Type IV (throwable) device.
      </li>
      <li id="t52c07s52-7-8ol12">
       No person may use a vessel upon the waters of this state unless the personal flotation devices as required in paragraph (1) of this subsection are readily accessible to the occupants of the vessel, are in good and serviceable condition, are legibly marked with the United States Coast Guard approved number, and are of an appropriate size for the occupants of the vessel for whom they are intended; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to racing sculls, racing shells, racing sweeps, or homemade or inflatable rafts, as defined in subsection (o) of Code Section 52-7-12, if such rafts are operated no more than 100 feet from shore on a lake, pond, or other nonflowing body of water.

      Equipment exemptions in authorized races. Subsections (c) and (e) of this Code section shall not apply to vessels while competing in any race conducted pursuant to Code Section 52-7-19 or, if such vessels are designed and intended solely for racing, while engaged in such navigation as is incidental to the tuning up of the boats and engines for the race.
     </p>
     <p>
      Flame arrester for carburetor. Every vessel shall have the carburetor or carburetors of every engine therein, except outboard motors using gasoline as fuel, equipped with an efficient United States Coast Guard approved flame arrester, backfire trap, or other similar device.

         The General Assembly finds that because of the increasing number of vessels having marine toilets which are operated or moored on Allatoona Lake, Lake Blackshear, Clarks Hill Lake, Hartwell Lake, Lake Sidney Lanier, Lake Oconee, Lake Seminole, Lake Sinclair, Russell Lake, Walter F. George Reservoir, Lake Blue Ridge, and West Point Lake, it is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare to prohibit the discharge of sewage from such vessels into the waters of such lakes.

         Because of the findings stated in paragraph (1) of this subsection, it is declared to be the intent of the General Assembly to protect and enhance the quality of the waters of such lakes by requiring greater environmental protection than is provided pursuant to Section 312 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, such that any discharge of sewage from a vessel into the waters of such lakes shall be prohibited.

       ARTICLE III. FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY, AND PURPOSE
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       a)Party states find that:
      </h5>
      <p>
       Boating activities are managed for the benefit of all residents and visitors;
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefits of boating activities can be materially affected by the degree that a citation is answered, through appearance at a court, magistrate, or tribunal and the payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any;
      </p>
      <p>
       The management of boating activities contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of party states;
      </p>
      <p>
       Boating activities are valuable without regard to political boundaries. Therefore, all persons should be required to comply with boating laws of party states as a condition precedent to the privilege to operate;
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of boating laws interferes with the management of boating activities and may endanger the safety of persons and property;
      </p>
      <p>
       The mobility of people who violate boating laws necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among party states;
      </p>
      <p>
       In most instances, when an issuing state is a location other than a home state, a person:
      </p>
      <p>
       Promote adherence to boating laws and have a citation answered through a court, magistrate, or tribunal appearance and the payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any;
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognize that any revocation, denial, or withdrawal of any license by a party state should be treated the same in all states, territories, and possessions of the United States, including the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow violators to accept a citation, except as provided in subsection (b) of Article IV of this compact, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the violator is a resident where the citation was issued, provided that the home state of the violator is a party state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against a person whose home state was not the issuing state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow a home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for its residents which occurred in a party state as if they had occurred in the home state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among party states for having citations which are issued in a party state answered through court, magistrate, or tribunal appearances and the payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any;
      </p>
      <p>
       Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of boating violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide a means through which party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of a person issued a citation within a party state in recognition of such person's right of due process and the sovereign status of such party state.

      <h5>
       ARTICLE IV. PROCEDURES FOR ISSUING STATE
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       a)A citation shall be issued in the same manner as if the person receiving such citation was a resident of the issuing state and shall not require the person to post collateral, subject to the exceptions contained in subsection (b) of this article, if the officer receives the person's personal recognizance.
      </h5>
      <p>
       It is not prohibited by local law or the compact manual; and
      </p>
      <p>
       The violator provides adequate proof of his or her identification to the officer.

     <div>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE V. PROCEDURES FOR HOME STATE
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       a)Upon receipt of a report of failure to comply with the conditions and options expressly stated in a citation from the boating authority of the issuing state, the boating authority of the home state shall notify the violator, shall initiate a suspension in accordance with the home state's suspension procedures, and shall suspend the violator's license until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the conditions and options expressly stated in such citation has been furnished by the issuing state to the boating authority of the home state. Due process safeguards shall be accorded.
      </h5>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE VI. RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION OF SUSPENSION
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       a)A party state shall recognize a suspension of any person by any state, territory, or possession of the United States, including the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as if the violation on which the suspension is based occurred in such party state and could have been the basis for suspension in such party state.

       ARTICLE VII. APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS
       <span class="headbreak">

       Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing in this compact shall be construed to affect the right of a party state to apply any of its boating laws to a person or circumstance or to invalidate or prevent any agreement or other cooperative arrangements between a party state and any other state, territory, or possession of the United States, including the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, concerning boating law enforcement.

      All liens acquired under Code Section 52-7-73 shall be foreclosed as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t52c07s52-7-74ol11">
       Any proceeding to foreclose a lien on an abandoned vessel must be instituted within one year from the time the lien is recorded or is asserted by retention;
      </li>
      <li id="t52c07s52-7-74ol12">
       The person desiring to foreclose a lien on an abandoned vessel shall, by certified or registered mail or statutory overnight delivery, make a demand upon the owner for the payment of the reasonable fees for removal and storage plus the costs of any advertisement. Such written demand shall include an itemized statement of all charges. No such written demand shall be required if the identity of the owner cannot be ascertained and the notice requirements of subsection (g) of Code Section 52-7-71 have been complied with;
      </li>

       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t52c07s52-7-74ol13A">
         If, within ten days of delivery to the appropriate address of the written demand required by paragraph (2) of this Code section, the owner of the abandoned vessel fails to respond to such demand or refuses to pay, or if the owner of the abandoned vessel cannot be ascertained, the person removing or storing the abandoned vessel may foreclose such lien. The person asserting such lien may move to foreclose by making an affidavit to a court of competent jurisdiction showing all facts necessary to constitute such lien and the amount claimed to be due. Such affidavit shall aver that the notice requirements of Code Section 52-7-71 have been complied with, and such affidavit shall also aver that a demand for payment has been made and refused or that the identity of the owner cannot be ascertained. The person foreclosing shall verify the statement by oath or affirmation and shall affix his signature thereto.
        </li>
        <li id="t52c07s52-7-74ol13B">
         Regardless of the court in which the affidavit required by this paragraph is filed, the fee for filing such affidavit shall be $5.00 per vessel upon which a lien is asserted;

         Upon such affidavit's being filed, the lien claimant shall give the clerk or judge of the court the address, if known, of the owner, lessor, lessee, security interest holders, and lienholders of the abandoned vessel. The clerk or judge of the court shall serve notice upon such owner, lessor, lessee, security interest holders, and lienholders of the abandoned vessel of a right to a hearing to determine if reasonable cause exists to believe that a valid debt exists; that such hearing must be petitioned for within ten days after receipt of such notice; and that, if no petition for such hearing is filed within the time allowed, the lien will conclusively be deemed a valid one and foreclosure thereof allowed.

       If a petition for a probable cause hearing is filed within the time allowed, the court shall set such a hearing within ten days of filing of the petition. If, at the hearing, the court determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a valid debt exists, then the person asserting the lien shall retain possession of the vessel or the court shall obtain possession of the vessel, as ordered by the court. The owner-debtor may obtain possession of the vessel by giving bond and security in the amount determined to be probably due and costs of the action;
      </li>
      <li id="t52c07s52-7-74ol16">
       Within five days of the probable cause hearing, a party defendant must petition the court for a full hearing on the validity of the debt if a further determination of the validity of the debt is desired. If no such petition is filed, the lien for the amount determined reasonably due shall conclusively be deemed a valid one and foreclosure thereof allowed. If such a petition is filed, the court shall set a full hearing thereon within 15 days of the filing of the petition. Upon the filing of such petition by a party defendant, neither the prosecuting lienholder nor the court may sell the vessel, although possession of the vessel may be retained;
      </li>
      <li id="t52c07s52-7-74ol17">
       If, after a full hearing, the court finds that a valid debt exists, then the court shall authorize foreclosure upon and sale of the vessel subject to the lien to satisfy the debt if such debt is not otherwise immediately paid;

      <li id="t52c07s52-7-74ol18">
       If the court finds the actions of the person asserting the lien in retaining possession of the vessel were not taken in good faith, then the court, in its discretion, may award damages to the owner, any party which has been deprived of the rightful use of the vessel, or the lessee due to the deprivation of the use of the vessel; and

       If no petition for a hearing is filed, or if, after a full hearing, the court determines that a valid debt exists, the court shall issue an order authorizing the sale of such vessel. However, the holder of a security interest in or a lien on the vessel, other than the holder of a lien created by Code Section 52-7-73, shall have the right, in the order of priority of such security interest or lien, to pay the debt and court costs. If the holder of a security interest or lien does so pay the debt and court costs, such person shall have the right to possession of the vessel, and that person's security interest in or lien on such vessel shall be increased by the amount so paid. A court order shall be issued to this effect, and in this instance there shall not be a sale of the vessel.

      The General Assembly recognizes the need for maintaining navigation inlets, harbors, and rivers to promote commercial and recreational uses of our coastal waters and their resources. The General Assembly further recognizes that dredging activities to deepen or maintain navigation channels within tidal inlets, as well as the entrances to harbors and rivers, often alter the natural drift of sand resources within the littoral zone. This alteration can be exacerbated when the sand resources are deposited in designated upland or offshore disposal areas instead of being returned to the natural river-sand transport-beach system. This alteration can adversely impact natural resources, recreation, tourism, and associated coastal economies. Moreover, the General Assembly believes in the duties of government to protect life and property. Therefore, it is the policy of this state that there shall be no net loss of sand from the state's coastal barrier beaches resulting from dredging activities to deepen or maintain navigation channels within tidal inlets, as well as the entrances to harbors and rivers.
