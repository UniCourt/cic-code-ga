       - The Twenty-First Amendment removes spirituous liquors and alcohol from the protection of the commerce clause to the extent necessary to allow states to adopt and enforce appropriate laws and regulations dealing with the subject, and thus to burden interstate commerce to this extent. Even in absence of any protection under the Twenty-First Amendment, the sovereign states in the exercise of their reserve police power may, without offending the commerce clause, adopt and enforce necessary laws and regulations to effectuate their own protection against illegal traffic and trade in liquors.

       <p>
        - A liquor license holder has a sufficient property interest in holding license to date of its automatic termination that revocation of that license must be accompanied by rudimentary due process protections. Liquor license revocation procedures which provide for a hearing, preceded by advance notice setting forth charge forming basis for revocation, are sufficient to comport adequately with due process mandates. Page v. Jackson, 398 F. Supp. 263 (N.D. Ga. 1975) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

        A license to sell spirituous liquors is neither a contract nor a property right in licensee, but a mere permit
       
       to do what would otherwise be an offense against the general law. Smith v. Nix, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 403</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 275</cite> (1950) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

        <p>

        The authority to regulate traffic in liquor in state is solely within police power of state,
       
       and privilege of possessing and selling liquor in state can be obtained only by strict compliance with state's laws regulating traffic and sale of liquors. Akins v. State, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 650</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E.2d 125</cite> (1968) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>

        - It was a denial of equal protection for the sheriff and county commissioners to refuse to grant a beer and wine license to a qualified applicant while at the same time conspiring to ignore illegal beer sales by other establishments in the county.

       - Because state law does not grant an applicant a property interest in the opportunity to acquire a liquor license, a county commissioner's failure to establish standards for the granting of a license does not violate the applicant's due process rights.

       - A municipality which has not conducted a local referendum, but is located within a county which has held a referendum, is not empowered by the result of the county referendum to allow sales of liquor by the drink.

        County ordinance using voting districts and property lines
       
       to determine the number and location of licensed stores was reasonably related to the county's goal of regulating the retail sale of beer and wine and did not violate due process. Bradshaw v.

       - If governing authority of city or county decides to permit sale of malt beverages or beer, it shall adopt an ordinance setting forth prescribed standards for issuance of licenses.

   §
   1/HB 517, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "The General Assembly finds that there are neighborhoods and downtown areas in this state near college campuses that are underserved by grocery stores, making it difficult for residents who live in such neighborhoods and downtown areas to access daily essentials and adequate food supplies and nutrition, especially those residents who do not own automobiles. The General Assembly further finds that owners of grocery stores may be reluctant to locate such stores in areas in which it is not possible to sell packages of wine and malt beverages when such sales are permitted elsewhere in the county or municipality. The General Assembly further finds that allowing a local governing authority of a county or municipality to have local control of the distance requirements for the package sales of wine and malt beverages near college campuses will permit such local governments to determine how to best serve the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens."

         Legislative intent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The objective when the legislature provided that liquor stores should not be located within 200 (now 100 for wine or beer) yards of a school ground was that there should be no traffic in liquor within specified distance so that teachers and pupils should not be subjected to evil influences connected with liquor traffic. Certainly the legislature did not intend to include in the prohibition all premises on which school children might happen to congregate. Haley v. Bailey, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 486</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 685</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The General Assembly intended to establish an area between schools and businesses which sell beer and wine. A reasonable interpretation of legislative intent necessarily requires that the 100-yard barrier of this section apply to schools rather than school buildings. The restriction of sale of beer near schools has no relationship to the building but to the occupants. Since students may receive instructions and congregate on school premises, it is legislative intent that beer and wine not be sold within 100 yards of instructional premises. Davidson v. Lovett, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 375</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 61</cite> (1978).

The doctor did not have any legal authority to restrain the truck driver for the benefit of the public, and, thus, owed no duty to the decedent to not have provided the certificate to the truck driver.

       - Crimes of possession of alcoholic beverage by underage person and furnishing alcohol to minor do not require state to prove certain alcohol level in defendants. State v. Ealum, <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 799</cite>, <cite class="app_court">643 S.E.2d 262</cite> (2007).

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for furnishing alcohol to a minor. The victim testified that defendant gave the victim, a minor, alcohol to drink in defendant's home, and the victim's parent testified that when the victim returned home, the victim's eyes were bloodshot and the parent could smell the alcohol on the victim's breath.

        <p>
       - One who is present at a distillery when liquor is being manufactured and personally assists in any way in the manufacture is guilty of manufacturing liquor, and it is immaterial whether or not one owns the distillery, and whether or not one is hired to work there. Tanner v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">90 Ga. App. 789</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 600</cite> (1954) (decided under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the presence of the defendant at a place where a still was in operation and the defendant's flight from it would have been sufficient to have convicted the defendant of manufacturing whiskey and since the same rule as to sufficiency must apply where one is charged with possession of whiskey stored at such a distillery, the evidence was sufficient to authorize the jury to find the defendant guilty. Johnson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">79 Ga. App. 210</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 498</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - While it is not unlawful for one to be present at a liquor still while it is in operation, where the jury finds that the defendant was not only at the still, but assisted in its operation in some manner, the defendant's conviction would be authorized. Brown v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">87 Ga. App. 244</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E.2d 502</cite> (1952) (decided under Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

        One's presence at a still is not alone sufficient to sustain a conviction

         Evidence sufficient to support conviction for making whiskey.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Testimony of two witnesses for the state that the defendant admitted to them that the defendant had been helping to make whiskey at the time and place in question, together with undisputed evidence that the defendant was present at the time of the raid at a still then in operation and where whiskey was being made, was sufficient to support the conviction for manufacturing whiskey. Lastinger v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">84 Ga. App. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 411</cite> (1951) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   58-206).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While there was no evidence that whiskey had been distilled, since raid apparently occurred at a time when operation was just beginning and whiskey had not yet had time to run off, evidence was nevertheless sufficient to support verdict of illegal manufacture of alcohol. Bryant v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 208</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 446</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   58-206).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Evidence that two men, one of whom was the defendant, were found at a still pumping up the tank, that they ran when the officers approached and the defendant was apprehended, and that the still was in operation at the time and over 20 gallons of liquor had already been run is sufficient to sustain a conviction of manufacturing intoxicating liquor. Peebles v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">96 Ga. App. 836</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 726</cite> (1958) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Evidence of making beer sufficient to support conviction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The act of making intoxicating beer, through fermentation of syrup, cornmeal, and water mixed for that purpose, is of itself an offense as complete and distinct as the further act of distilling from such beer a quantity of alcohol, whiskey, or rum, and failure of evidence to show distillation of any quantity of whiskey does not, therefore, leave conviction of accused without any evidence to show that the accused was guilty of making such beer. Bryant v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 208</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 446</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where evidence was sufficient to authorize the jury to find that the defendant was manufacturing alcoholic beer, an offense under this section, indictment for unlawfully manufacturing alcoholic liquors, spirituous liquors, whiskey, and rum was broad enough in its terms to include that offense, and the verdict finding the defendant guilty and recommending that the defendant be punished as for a misdemeanor was supported by evidence. Cook v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 629</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - The purchase by the defendant a short time prior to the defendant's apprehension of almost 25,000 pounds of sugar in less than two months, being a quantity vastly in excess of the requirements of an average person, but a quantity which suited capacity of a still, was a circumstance, together with others, tending to identify the defendant with illegal manufacture of alcohol and was for that reason admissible in evidence. Bryant v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 208</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 446</cite> (1953) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Conviction under former Code 1933,
   §

       - Where the defendant admitted that the defendant manufactured the beer which the sheriff found within curtilage of the defendant's dwelling house and sought to excuse the defendant on the ground that the defendant made it for hog feed, it was within the province of the jury to disbelieve this contention of the defendant.

       - In order to convict a person of unlawful possession of liquor, it must be shown that the accused knowingly had, possessed, or controlled intoxicating liquor, and the accused must have done something the accused ought not to have done or omitted to do something the accused ought to have done with reference to the whiskey, and while it is not necessary in order to constitute offense of unlawful possession that the accused should have legal control or that it should have been the accused's property, it is essential that the accused should have power to control it, and if whiskey was placed in the accused's place of business and the accused knew it, the accused acquiesces in the possession and is criminally liable therefore. Kelly v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 421</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 794</cite> (1955) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

       - Where the accusation charges the defendant with the offense of possessing non-tax-paid whiskey in dry county, which is a specific crime, the burden is on the state to show that the whiskey found in possession of the defendant is not tax-paid. Ivey v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">84 Ga. App. 72</cite>, <cite class="app_court">65 S.E.2d 282</cite> (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Mere introduction of accusation with pleas of guilty thereon, embracing same crime for which defendant is on trial, without proof of details as to manner in which previous acts were committed, does not constitute similarity of transactions so connected as to reveal knowledge, plan, or system, and therefore the court erred in admitting, over objections, prior accusation and plea of guilty of defendant, charged with possession of non-tax-paid whiskey, to a previous charge of same offense. Chambers v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">76 Ga. App. 269</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 724</cite> (1947) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

       - Where, upon approach of arresting officers, an attempt is made to dispose of liquid identified by witnesses by sense of smell as being whiskey or whiskey poured into water, this is a circumstance which may be considered in prosecution for possession of non-tax-paid whiskey.

       - Although proof that illegal liquor was found in the home of the accused, the accused being the head of the household, raises a rebuttable presumption of the accused's possession thereof, proof of which is sufficient to make out a prima facie case, where the premises are occupied by the defendant with others not members of the accused's immediate family, the presumption does not obtain. Brown v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 713</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 813</cite> (1959) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where officers, while in search of a whiskey still which had been reported to them, heard nearby noises of bottles being shoved around and clinking together, and where they immediately investigated and found the defendant and the defendant's brother together examining a strainer, and further found over 70 pints of bottled whiskey not having required state revenue stamps, such evidence was sufficient to show control and possession in the defendant and the defendant's brother and to support a verdict of guilty against the defendant. Ridley v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">66 Ga. App. 658</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 51</cite> (1942) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Jury was authorized to conclude from evidence that defendant was a confederate with the defendant's brother and another individual in illegal possession of non-tax-paid liquor, that a conspiracy existed between the three to violate the liquor law, and that while another individual was driving and owned the car, the 45 gallons of whiskey in the back of the car were in the joint and exclusive possession of the three. Lee v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 645</cite> (1945) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where it appears that defendant is in sole control of premises and public does not have access thereto, where the only tracks from cache of liquor lead to defendant's home and fresh tracks show recent travel from house to liquor, and where there are no other residents in vicinity and cache is not near any road, trail, alley, or path used by others than the defendant and the defendant's household, the evidence, though circumstantial, is sufficient to negate every other reasonable hypothesis save that of guilt of accused. Corbin v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">84 Ga. App. 763</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 478</cite> (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Testimony of state's witness that the witness found non-tax-paid whiskey in a half-gallon jar on top of some clothes in closet of room occupied by defendant, together with glass of whiskey in kitchen in cabinet that had secret panel behind it was sufficient, coupled with defendant's admission that it was "all her house," to sustain conviction of possessing illegal liquor, although there were other people in house at time arrest was made. Grantley v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">90 Ga. App. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 98</cite> (1954) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A conviction may be had upon a free and voluntary confession corroborated only by proof of the corpus delicti, and where, upon the trial of one charged with possession of non-tax-paid whiskey, it appears from the evidence that police officers found some five and one-half pints of non-tax-paid liquor in defendant's home, and that defendant freely and voluntarily confessed that the non-tax-paid liquor belonged to the defendant, the jury is authorized to find the defendant guilty as charged. Poythress v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">95 Ga. App. 124</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 165</cite> (1957) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where five and one-half gallons of moonshine were found in back seat of long-unused automobile in back yard of petitioner's residence, which yard was fenced with a fence of sufficient construction and security to keep contained therein a dog, and a well-beaten path led from petitioner's back door to automobile, and there was a quantity of used whiskey bottles under back of petitioner's house, evidence was sufficient to authorize conviction for possessing non-tax-paid whiskey. West v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 71</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 491</cite> (1961) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

        <p>
       - The evidence, being wholly circumstantial, was insufficient to sustain conviction for offense of possessing non-tax-paid whiskey. Weehunt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">80 Ga. App. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E.2d 148</cite> (1949) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Whiskey found by a trail or ditch or in bushes at some distance from the house, and especially when on property not under control of the defendant, has been held insufficient as the foundation of a conviction. Freeman v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">84 Ga. App. 757</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 314</cite> (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where the conviction for possessing non-tax-paid whiskey depends entirely upon the circumstance of liquor being found on premises belonging to or under control of the defendant, and where such liquor is located by a public path, in a public part of building, in an unenclosed field by a travelled road or alley, or other circumstances appear not negating the possibility that a person other than the defendant might have had the opportunity to conceal the liquor in place where it was found, a conviction is unauthorized. Corbin v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">84 Ga. App. 763</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 478</cite> (1951) (decided under former Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103).

      The General Assembly finds, determines, and declares that the direct shipment of alcoholic beverages by persons in the business of selling alcoholic beverages in other states or countries to residents of this state in violation of this title poses a serious threat to the public health, safety, revenue, and the economy of Georgia. The General Assembly further finds, determines, and declares that the present penalties for illegal direct shipments of alcoholic beverages to residents of this state are inadequate to ensure compliance with the provisions of this title and that the measures provided for in Code Section 3-3-32 are fully consistent with the powers conferred upon the State of Georgia by the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Sess., p. 103, to provide that voters of any dry county should have the right to determine whether the county should remain dry or become wet, and that, regardless of how that election went, voters should have an opportunity, after expiration of two years, to again determine whether county should be wet or dry.

        JUDICIAL DECISIONS

      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>

       This section authorizes the licensing by state of distilling and manufacturing only in those counties which have voted in favor
      
      of taxing and controlling alcoholic liquors. A license cannot, therefore, be lawfully issued and granted by the state to a person to manufacture, sell, or distribute alcohol or distilled spirits in a dry county. It is, therefore, no penal offense, separate from the unlawful manufacture of alcoholic liquor, for a person to operate a whiskey still and manufacture such alcoholic liquor or alcohol without obtaining a license to do so from the state. Shuman v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 130</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 521</cite> (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       A person cannot be legally licensed by state to manufacture alcoholic liquors in dry county;
      
      hence, one found operating illicit liquor still in dry county cannot be convicted of operating a distillery without a license in violation of this section. Odum v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 134</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 522</cite> (1950); Tanner v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">90 Ga. App. 789</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 600</cite> (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Where commodity may be legally sold under a license, indictment alleging unlawful sale of such commodity must negate fact that accused had a license,
      
      under terms of which sale would have been legal. Thus, an indictment for unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors which fails to allege that either accused or purchasers did not have a distillers' license is insufficient. Capitol Distrib. Co. v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">83 Ga. App. 303</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 451</cite> (1951).

    - Lawful operation of properly licensed package liquor store is an authorized business in those counties where a majority of qualified voters voting in an election for such purpose have approved the sale of liquor, and cannot be enjoined as a nuisance per se, since that which the law authorizes to be done, if done as the law authorizes, is not such a nuisance.

It follows that if either election be called without such petition having first been presented, such election is a nullity. Glass v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">75 Ga.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where there were several circulated petitions seeking to call a special election to nullify previously voted authority for sale of alcoholic beverages and liquors within county, but majority of names were signed to individual petitions asking in legal terms that election be called, each petition signed by one individual registered voter, and all petitions were pasted in one consolidated petition and presented to the ordinary (election superintendent), such consolidated petition was held to be sufficient in form to meet requirements of this section, there being evidence to show there was a sufficient number of signatures to bring the total to the required 35 percent.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The fact that the ordinary (election superintendent) was one of those who signed, as an individual, a petition requesting the call of a special election for purpose of submitting to qualified voters of county the question of taxing, legalizing, and controlling alcoholic beverages and liquors, did not show that the ordinary was disqualified because the ordinary was pecuniarily interested in the matter before the ordinary, or that the ordinary was otherwise disqualified from calling and holding a special election.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The ordinary (election superintendent) is required to verify that petitions were signed by at least 35 percent of registered voters before the ordinary can issue a valid election call, and this prerequisite is mandatory. The only requirement imposed by this section with respect to the petition is that it be "signed by at least 35 percent of the registered voters qualified to vote at the general election immediately preceding the presentation of the petition." The calling of the election by the ordinary as authorized by this section determines at least prima facie that the petitioners are of the class and are of a sufficient number as required by this section for the purpose of calling an election.

       <p>
        <p>
       - While this section provides that the ordinary (election superintendent) "shall call a special election to be held within 30 days from the filing of such petition," this is not an absolute requirement that election must be held within that period of time. Where election is not required by statute to be held on a date certain, and where election is prevented by court order, it is permissible to reschedule election after expiration of court's injunction even though the 30-day period has elapsed. If there is a statutory time period within which election must be held and, following litigation, there is no longer time to hold election within statutory period, an election may be held after statutory period has expired.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where call for election as issued by the ordinary (election superintendent) on the question of legalizing alcoholic beverages gave notice that election would be held in all voting precincts of county, and that voting polls would be open in all voting precincts of county between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M., and that those qualified to vote at the election would be determined in all respects in accordance with the laws governing elections for members of General Assembly, the call was in substantial accord with this section and was sufficient.

Under this section the two weekly publications of notice must precede the week in which election is held. Whittle v.

       - A cursory reading of both Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 103,
   §
   4
   and Ga. L. 1941, p. 199,
   §

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c04s3-4-41" target="_self">3-4-41</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c04s3-4-46" target="_self">3-4-46</a></cite>) would disclose that before the ordinary (election superintendent) was authorized to call an election under either section a petition signed by 35 percent or more of the qualified voters of the county must be presented. It follows that if either election be called without such petition having first been presented, such election is a nullity. Glass v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">75 Ga. App. 602</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1947), overruled on other grounds, Domin v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">85 Ga. App. 676</cite>, <cite class="app_court">70 S.E.2d 39</cite> (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Among the prerequisites to the call of an election for nullifying a previous election are:
       
       (1) no election can be called within two years after the date of the declaration of the result of a previous election; (2) no election shall be called except upon the petition of at least 35 percent of the registered qualified voters, qualified to vote in the general election immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; and (3) the election shall be held within 30 days from the filing of the petition, and notice of the election shall be published in the official gazette of the county once a week for two weeks preceding the election. Barrentine v. Griner, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 830</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The requirement as to notice of special election was mandatory, and failure to comply therewith vitiated election;
       
       in these circumstances, petition by licensed liquor dealers, seeking to enjoin the ordinary (election superintendent) from putting the result of such election into effect, set forth a cause of action. The prerequisite as to proper petition by 35 percent of qualified registered voters is also mandatory, and it follows that failure to comply with the mandatory prerequisite vitiates election. Barrentine v. Griner, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 830</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1949).

         Effects of violations of mandatory and directory provisions on validity of election.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - There is a marked distinction between mandatory provisions of law in regard to calling of election and those which are merely directory to officials in holding them. A substantial violation of mandatory provisions affects validity of election, while a failure of strict compliance with directory provisions of law, or mere irregularities on part of election officers, will not generally do so; and the latter are usually the subject matter of contests. Barrentine v. Griner, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 830</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When petition has been acted upon and election ordered by designated authorities, presumption is that petition was in due and legal form
       
       and that it was signed by requisite percentage of qualified voters, and in absence of any evidence to the contrary, that presumption is sufficient. Sanders v. Mason, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 522</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 780</cite> (1944); Williams v. Gould, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 96</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 218</cite> (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Court of equity is not authorized to surmise or assume invalidity of signatures regularly presented to the ordinary (election superintendent),
       
       or to enjoin such officer from calling an election in the face of the ordinary's prima facie determination as to the sufficiency of the consolidated petition presented. Williams v. Gould, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 96</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 218</cite> (1947).

       <p>
        <p>
       - The action of the ordinary (election superintendent), as result of petition having been filed with the ordinary, in calling election and declaring results thereof, determines prima facie that requirements of this section providing for calling of such election have been complied with in due and legal form. This is nothing more nor less than a rebuttable presumption that the ordinary has properly performed the required duties. Sanders v. Mason, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 522</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 780</cite> (1944).

      (b) (1) (A)
   In the event the governing authority of any municipality or county coming under the provisions of this Code section desires to exercise the powers authorized by Code Section 3-4-90, the governing authority, through the election superintendent, shall conduct a referendum election for the purpose of determining whether or not these powers shall be exercised. Any such governing authority shall notify the election superintendent of the county or the municipality, as the case may be, of the referendum, by forwarding to the superintendent a copy of a resolution of such governing authority calling for such a referendum election. Upon receipt of such resolution, it shall be the duty of such election superintendent to set a date and to issue the call for an election for the purpose of submitting the question of whether or not the governing authority of the county or municipality shall be authorized to issue licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises. The superintendent shall set the date of the referendum election for not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the call. The referendum may be held as a special referendum or may be held at the time of holding any other primary or election in such county or municipality, if such other primary or election is to be held not more than 60 days after the call. Notice of the call for the referendum shall be published by the superintendent in the legal organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. The election superintendent shall also cause the date and purpose of the referendum to be published in the official organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date of the election. The ballot shall have printed thereon the following:
     </p>

   YES
   Shall the governing authority of ________ be authorized to issue
   licenses
   [
   ]
   NO

     </p>
     <p>
      All persons desiring to vote in favor shall vote "Yes," and those persons opposed shall vote "No." If more than one-half of the votes cast on such question are in favor of issuing licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises, then the governing authority shall, in accordance with this Code section, issue such licenses; otherwise, no license shall be issued. If held as a special election, it shall be the duty of the election superintendent to hold and conduct such election under the same rules that govern special elections as provided in Chapter 2 of Title 21, the "Georgia Election Code." It shall be his further duty to canvass the returns and declare and certify the results of the election to the Secretary of State. The expense for the election shall be borne by the county or the municipality conducting the election.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following the expiration of one year after any election is held which results in the disapproval of sales as provided in this article, another election on this question shall be held if the governing authority, as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, forwards a resolution to the election superintendent calling for such a referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) (A) In the event the governing authority of any municipality or county coming under the provisions of this Code section does not adopt a resolution directing the election superintendent to issue a call for the referendum provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection, then, upon a written petition containing the signatures of 15 percent of the registered and qualified voters of any municipality or county coming within the provisions of this Code section being filed with the appropriate election superintendent, such election superintendent, upon validation of the petition, shall be required to call and hold a referendum election for the purpose of submitting to the qualified voters of the municipality or the county, as the case may be, the question of whether or not the governing authority shall be authorized to issue licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises. A petition shall not be amended, supplemented, or returned after presentation to the appropriate authority. "Validation" shall, for the purposes of this Code section, be the procedure in which the election superintendent determines whether each signature on the petition is the name of a registered and qualified voter. For purposes of this Code section the required number of signatures of registered voters of a political subdivision shall be computed based on the number of voters qualified to vote at the general election immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. Actual signers of the petition shall be registered and qualified to vote in the referendum election sought by the petition. Upon determining that the petition contains a sufficient number of valid signatures, the election superintendent shall set the date of the referendum election for not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the call. The referendum may be held as a special referendum election or may be held at the time of holding any other primary or election in such county or municipality, if such other primary or election is to be held not more than 60 days after the call. Notice of the call for the referendum shall be published by the superintendent in the legal organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. The election superintendent shall also cause the date and purpose of the referendum to be published in the official organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date of the election. The ballot shall have printed thereon the following:

     </p>
     <p>
      All persons desiring to vote in favor shall vote "Yes," and those persons opposed shall vote "No." If more than one-half of the votes cast on such question are in favor of issuing licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises, then the governing authority shall, in accordance with this Code section, issue such licenses; otherwise, no license shall be issued. If conducted as a special election, it shall be the duty of the election superintendent to hold and conduct such election under the same rules that govern special elections as provided in Chapter 2 of Title 21, the "Georgia Election Code." It shall be his further duty to canvass the returns and declare and certify the results of the election to the Secretary of State.

     </p>
     <p>
      In any municipality or county which has at any time held an election in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section resulting in the majority of the votes being cast in favor of sales of distilled spirits by the drink, the election superintendent of the municipality or county, upon a petition signed by at least 15 percent of the registered, qualified voters of the municipality or county, shall proceed to call another election for the purpose of nullifying the previous election in the same manner as prescribed in subsection (b) of this Code section. No election shall be called or held within two years after the date of the declaration by the election superintendent of the results of the previous election held for the purposes of this Code section.

       In every county and municipality in which package sales of distilled spirits are not lawful, sales of distilled spirits as provided in this article may be authorized after approval as provided in this Code section.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (b) (1) (A)
   In the event the governing authority of any municipality or county coming under the provisions of this Code section desires to exercise the powers authorized by Code Section 3-4-90, the governing authority through the appropriate election superintendent shall conduct a referendum election for the purpose of determining whether or not these powers shall be exercised. Any such governing authority shall notify the election superintendent of the county or the municipality, as the case may be, of the referendum by forwarding to the superintendent a copy of a resolution of such governing authority calling for such a referendum election. It shall be the duty of such election superintendent to issue the call and set the date for an election in accordance with Code Section 21-2-540 for the purpose of submitting the question of whether or not the governing authority of the county or municipality shall be authorized to issue licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises. Notice of the call for the referendum shall be published by the superintendent in the legal organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. The election superintendent shall also cause the date and purpose of the referendum to be published in the official organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date of the election. The ballot shall have printed thereon the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "[
   ]
   YES
   Shall the governing authority of ________ be authorized to issue
   licenses
   [
   ]
   NO
   to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises?"
     </p>
     <p>
      All persons desiring to vote in favor shall vote "Yes," and those persons opposed shall vote "No." If more than one-half of the votes cast are in favor of issuing licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sale to be for consumption only on the premises, then the governing authority shall in accordance with this Code section issue such licenses; otherwise, no license shall be issued. It shall be the duty of the election superintendent to hold and conduct such election under the provisions of Chapter 2 of Title 21, the "Georgia Election Code." It shall be the superintendent's further duty to canvass the returns and declare and certify the results of the election to the Secretary of State. The expense of the election shall be borne by the county or the municipality conducting the election.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following the expiration of two years after any election is held which results in the disapproval of sales as provided in this article, another election on this question shall be held if the governing authority, as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, forwards a resolution to the election superintendent calling for such a referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nullification of a referendum approving such sales held pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished only as provided in subsection (c) of this Code section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) (A) In the event the governing authority of any municipality or county coming under the provisions of this Code section does not adopt a resolution directing the election superintendent to issue a call for the referendum provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection, then, upon a written petition containing the signatures of 35 percent of the registered and qualified voters of any municipality or county described in subsection (a) of this Code section being filed with the appropriate election superintendent, such election superintendent, upon validation of the petition, shall be required to call and hold a referendum election for the purpose of submitting to the qualified voters of the municipality or the county, as the case may be, the question of whether or not the governing authority shall be authorized to issue licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises. A petition shall not be amended, supplemented, or returned after presentation to the appropriate authority. "Validation" shall, for the purposes of this Code section, be the procedure in which the election superintendent determines whether each signature on the petition is the name of a registered and qualified voter. For the purposes of this Code section, the required number of signatures of registered voters of a political subdivision shall be computed based on the number of voters qualified to vote at the general election immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. Actual signers of the petition shall be registered and qualified to vote in the referendum election sought by the petition. Upon determining that the petition contains a sufficient number of valid signatures, the superintendent shall issue the call and set the date of the referendum election in accordance with Code Section 21-2-540. Notice of the call for the referendum shall be published by the superintendent in the legal organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. The election superintendent shall also cause the date and purpose of the referendum to be published in the official organ of the county or, in the case of a municipality, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date of the election. The ballot shall have printed thereon the following:

     </p>
     <p>
      All persons desiring to vote in favor shall vote "Yes," and those persons opposed shall vote "No." If more than one-half of the votes cast on such a question are in favor of issuing licenses to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes by the drink, such sales to be for consumption only on the premises, then the governing authority shall in accordance with this Code section issue such licenses; otherwise no license shall be issued. It shall be the duty of the election superintendent to hold and conduct such election under the same rules that govern special elections as provided in Chapter 2 of Title 21, the "Georgia Election Code." It shall further be the superintendent's duty to canvass the returns and declare and certify the results of the election to the Secretary of State. The expense for the election shall be borne by the county or the municipality conducting the election.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following the expiration of two years after any election is held which results in the disapproval of sales as provided in this article, another election on this question shall be held if another petition, as provided in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of this subsection, is filed with the appropriate election superintendent.

      Nullification of a referendum approving such sales held pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished only as provided in subsection (c) of this Code section.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any municipality or county which has at any time held an election in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section resulting in a majority of the votes being cast in favor of sales of distilled spirits by the drink, the election superintendent of the municipality or county, upon a petition signed by at least 35 percent of the registered qualified voters of the municipality or county, shall proceed to call another election for the purpose of nullifying the previous election in the same manner as prescribed by paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Code section. No election shall be called or held within two years after the date of the declaration by the election superintendent of the results of the previous election held for the purposes of this Code section.

        - Georgia beer distributors do not have standing to sue for refund of beer tax paid on cans of beer subsequent to transfer of title from brewer to distributor; distributor, however, may relinquish damaged cans to carrier for claims salvage regardless of whether carrier has retail beer license, provided carrier does not resell damaged cans of beer. Such relinquishment to carrier is a sale within meaning of general law. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U70-162.

     Sale of malt beverages is privilege,
    
    and denial of license does not deprive accused of anything to which the accused has an absolute right. Collier v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">54 Ga.

      Nature of license and power of revocation.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - A license to sell beer in this state is neither a contract nor a right of property within legal and constitutional meaning of those terms. It is no more than a temporary permit to do that which would otherwise be unlawful, and forms part of internal police system of this state. Hence, authority which granted license retains power to revoke it for due cause. Ebling v. City of Rome, <cite class="ga_court">54 Ga. 608</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 727</cite> (1936).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Charge that sale of alcoholic beverages has been made without alleging that no license has been obtained
    
    does not constitute a crime. Plemmons v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">58 Ga. App. 131</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 104</cite> (1938).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     State not only must allege but also prove that defendant had no license to sell beer
    
    in prosecution for selling without license. Cheek v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">98 Ga. App. 874</cite>, <cite class="app_court">107 S.E.2d 247</cite> (1959).

      Enforcement of licensing regulation by writ of mandamus.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Since no one has inherent right to engage in intoxicating liquor business, licensing regulation is not proper subject for enforcement by writ of mandamus. Lindsey v. Hill, <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 518</cite>, <cite class="app_court">145 S.E.2d 556</cite> (1965).

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - An allegation that accused sold beer in county without first obtaining permit to do so from governing authority of such county is a good indictment; it need not specify kind of beer sold. Williams v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">73 Ga. App. 421</cite>, <cite class="app_court">36 S.E.2d 839</cite> (1946).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Mandamus is an available remedy where refusal to authorize sale of malt beverages is arbitrary and illegal. Tate v. Seymour, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 801</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 598</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       This section empowers county authorities to grant licenses, but the power to act is left to discretion of local authority, and if commissioner refuses to grant license, mandamus will not control the commissioner's discretion; however, when the refusal is arbitrary and contrary to law, mandamus is a remedy.

       <p>
        <p>
       - If governing authority of city or county decides to permit sale of malt beverages or beer, it shall adopt an ordinance setting forth the prescribed standards for issuance of licenses. When an applicant for a license meets these standards, refusal by governing authority to issue the license constitutes denial of equal protection, entitling applicant to writ of mandamus. Tipton v. City of Dudley, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 807</cite>, <cite class="app_court">251 S.E.2d 545</cite> (1979); Grandpa's Store, Inc. v.

       - The privilege of sales of beer and wine is conditional upon the city's exercise of its discretion in performing an affirmative act in either granting or refusing a permit or license; hence, sales by "implied consent" are not authorized or legal, and there is no violation of equal protection. Grandpa's Store, Inc. v. City of Norcross, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 350</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 59</cite> (1981).

       - Allegations in indictment charging that defendant possessed for sale and sold beer without first having obtained a license from Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of county is a material allegation, proof of which is essential to state's case. Where there is no testimony in record on subject of whether defendant did or did not have license to sell beer, under evidence as a whole a verdict in the defendant's favor was demanded. Crowe v.

    Ga.

      Notwithstanding any other contrary provision of law, any restaurant which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises may permit a patron to remove one unsealed bottle of wine per patron for consumption off premises, if the patron has purchased a meal and consumed a portion of the bottle of wine which has been purchased on the premises with such meal on the restaurant's premises. A partially consumed bottle of wine that is to be removed from the premises must be securely resealed by the licensee or its employees before removal from the premises. The partially consumed bottle of wine shall be placed in a bag or other container that is secured in such a manner that it is visibly apparent if the container has been subsequently opened or tampered with, and a dated receipt for the bottle of wine and meal shall be provided by the licensee and attached to the container. If transported in a motor vehicle, the container with the resealed bottle of wine shall be placed in a locked glove compartment, a locked trunk, or the area behind the last upright seat of a motor vehicle that is not equipped with a trunk.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c08s3-8-1" target="_self">3-8-1</a></cite> et seq., only the second city was authorized to impose and collect taxes on the sale, storage, and distribution of alcoholic beverages at the airport within the city's limits and that the first city had to refund any alcoholic beverage taxes that the city received in error for the sale, storage, and distribution of alcohol in portions of the airport located within the corporate boundaries of the second city.

         Applicability of sovereign immunity to action between city and county.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In a suit by a city against a county, seeking a portion of tax revenue raised by the county from alcoholic beverage sales, there was a threshold question of whether sovereign immunity applied in suits between political subdivisions of the same sovereign (such as the city and the county), which the trial court had not addressed; therefore, remand was required. Clayton County v. City of College Park, <cite class="ga_court">301 Ga. 653</cite>, <cite class="app_court">803 S.E.2d 63</cite> (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a case involving taxation of alcoholic beverages, the city's claims against the county were not barred by sovereign immunity since the city and county were merely exercising their own respective home rule powers by collecting tax revenues for their own purposes, and neither was acting on behalf of the State of Georgia; thus, there was no sovereignty to be maintained.

        <p>
       - If, at time in question and at time of solicitation for sale of whiskey, defendant was engaged in business of selling and possessing intoxicating liquor, it would be no defense that the defendant was merely induced by solicitation and misrepresentation to sell or possess such prohibited liquor.

       - All engaged in commission of misdemeanor are principals, and when a defendant works for another at the defendant's place of business, where the defendant's duties are to be performed, the defendant may be guilty of selling whiskey in dry county, even though the defendant is not owner of whiskey, but merely employee and agent of owner.

        <p>
       - Evidence that witness purchased whiskey with money furnished by officer, telling defendant that the witness had just gotten over a drunk and was feeling bad and begging defendant to sell the witness whiskey was not sufficient to raise defense of entrapment.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When one is being tried for illegal sale of whiskey, evidence that one was in possession of whiskey at or near time of alleged sale is admissible as a circumstance that one kept whiskey for sale or as corroboration of evidence that a sale had taken place, but such evidence, considered alone, will not support conviction of sale, and a charge to jury which leaves them under impression that it is sufficient, in and of itself, is clearly error. Springer v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">60 Ga. App. 641</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 679</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1993

       - Proof either that defendant directly or personally committed criminal offense (selling whiskey in dry county), or that the defendant aided or abetted criminal transaction of the defendant's employer at the employer's place of business, would authorize the defendant's conviction of offense of selling whiskey.

       - Statement of defendant that the defendant thought the defendant would be notified in the event of a raid, in connection with the defendant's other remarks and actions during course of search of club house, was sufficient to authorize jury to infer that the defendant was aiding and assisting in commission of misdemeanors of illegal possession of liquor and slot machines.

       - It was the purpose and intent of the General Assembly to legalize the possession, in a dry county, of one quart (now one standard case of 1.75 liter, or 750 milliliter size containers, but not more than eight individual containers of distilled spirits of a size of 200 milliliters or four individual containers of distilled spirits of a size of 500 milliliters) of whiskey legally purchased for use and consumption, when properly stamped, and no more.

       <p>
        <p>
       This section is intended to provide a method whereby a person in a dry county may legally possess a quart or less (now more) of tax-paid whiskey bearing revenue stamps so indicating which were originally purchased by the person or the person's donor from a lawful and authorized retailer in a wet county, provided such possession was for use and not for sale. This intention also is that such person may possess such whiskey in this quantity and under these circumstances and conditions without being in constant jeopardy of harassment and arrest. Jenkins v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">93 Ga. App. 360</cite>, <cite class="app_court">92 S.E.2d 43</cite> (1956).

       - It was not error for trial court to allow the state to show that the defendant, prior to the transaction under investigation, had transported liquor in county where trial was had, which evidence tended to refute the defendant's statement that the defendant did not employ a codefendant to transport liquor in that county and the defendant's statement that the defendant had not had liquor transported in that county for over three years.

       - When the petition alleged and the evidence showed that no license had been issued by governing authorities for the sale of wine, it was not error to admit in evidence several bottles of wine found at the place as a circumstance for the jury to consider whether or not the place was operated in violation of law. Elder v. Stark, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 452</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 598</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It was not error to admit into evidence several bottles of wine, over objection that there was no evidence of sale of wine but evidence only of possession, because possession of wine in quantities found may have been a circumstance to illustrate the contention that the place was a public nuisance, especially since other evidence disclosed that no license had been issued by the governing authorities for the sale of wine.

       - When, upon interlocutory hearing on petition to padlock building as common nuisance, evidence showed that 13 pints of whiskey were found in building and other evidence was sufficient to authorize trial judge to find that whiskey was sold in presence, and with consent, of party operating business therein, the interlocutory judgment enjoining operation of any business therein and directing sheriff to padlock building until further order of court was authorized.

       - Pleas of guilty to two charges of selling wine without license in county, entered about six months before action under this section was instituted, were material circumstances for consideration with the other evidence, although the evidence as to these pleas, without more, would not have authorized a finding that defendant's place of business was common nuisance within meaning of this section, at time action was filed.

       - While single transaction might not be sufficient to authorize abatement of place of business as common nuisance, in that law contemplates some continuity of violation, and evidence did not show directly any act of possession or sale later than about a month before action was filed, yet, in view of evidence as to pleas of guilty to selling without a license entered about six months before and evidence as to subsequent sales and possession, the judge was authorized to find that defendant was continuing in such violations of law and that the defendant's place of business was common nuisance within statute at time action was instituted.

       - Although evidence authorized abatement of nuisance, an order of the trial court was too broad in that it required padlocking of entire premises of defendant, notwithstanding all the evidence as to illegal sales of whiskey related solely to defendant's place of business, there being no evidence of sale or location of whiskey in the defendant's dwelling; and trial court, therefore, abused its discretion in passing so much of order as would result in padlocking of defendant's dwelling and dispossession of the defendant's family.

      Any common nuisance as defined in Code Section 3-10-8 shall be an unlawful place, and the act of keeping and maintaining any such place shall be deemed a separate offense for each day that it continues.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where a sheriff, upon seizing a vehicle conveying illegal liquor, turns it over to the federal government for condemnation under the federal Internal Revenue Code, instead of reporting its seizure to the prosecuting attorney as required by state statute, the sheriff does so at the sheriff's peril as a private citizen seizing private property for forfeiture to the federal government. If, however, the officer turns the property over to proper federal authorities for condemnation in federal court in a proceeding regular on its face, of which owner of vehicle had due notice of time and place of trial thereof, act of state officer in turning property over to federal government for condemnation is thereby ratified by federal government and such adoption on its part is sufficient recognition and confirmation of seizure to give it an equal validity in law with an original seizure under proper authority by an agent of federal government.
