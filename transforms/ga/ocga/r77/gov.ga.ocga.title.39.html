       - Ga. L. 1972, p. 193,
   §
   10, effective July 1, 1972, not codified by the General Assembly, provided that the purpose of the Act was to reduce the age of legal majority from 21 years of age to 18 years of age so that all persons, upon reaching the age of 18, would have the rights, privileges, powers, duties, responsibilities, and liabilities previously applicable to persons 21 years of age or over. The section further provided that the Act was not to be construed to have the effect of changing the age from 21 to 18 with respect to any legal instrument or court decree in existence prior to July 1, 1972, when the instrument referred only to "the age of majority" or words of similar import, except that any guardianship of the person or property of a minor under the provisions of Title 49 of the 1933 Code, whether such guardianship was created by court order or decree entered before or after July 1, 1972, or under the will of a testator which was executed after July 1, 1972, would terminate when the ward for whom such guardianship was created reached 18 years of age.

       - Without the consent of the husband-father in a child support controversy, neither the jury nor the court can require him to support his minor child beyond the child's eighteenth birthday, and an attempt to do so is a nullity.

The legislature has ample power to regulate the age of minority or majority, and may divide minors into two classes, those above and those below a certain age, and endow all those above such age with all the rights of adults in reference to certain kinds of contracts without violating the provision of the Constitution. The effect of such an Act is merely to provide that in reference to certain kinds of contracts the age of majority shall be 18 instead of 21 years. Rourke v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

      Diligence required of children.

    <p>
     <p>
    - Diligence required of children of tender years is not to be measured by the ordinary care required of an adult; but due care in such a child is such care as its capacity, mental and physical, fits it for exercising in the actual circumstances of the occasion and situation. Infants under 14 years of age are chargeable with contributory negligence resulting from a want of such care, and assuming the risk of those patent, obvious, and known dangers which the infants are able to appreciate and avoid. Evans v. Mills, <cite class="ga_court">119 Ga. 448</cite>, <cite class="app_court">46 S.E. 674</cite> (1904), (decided under former Code 1910,

      Fellow-servant doctrine not applicable.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - As a general rule, the master is not liable to one servant for injuries inflicted by a fellow servant because the risk thereof is one of those assumed in the contract of employment. But this doctrine does not apply to infants of tender years and the question of such negligence should be submitted to the jury. Evans v. Mills, <cite class="ga_court">119 Ga. 448</cite>, <cite class="app_court">46 S.E. 674</cite> (1904), (decided under former Code 1910,

     Provision in an employer's liability policy of insurance
    
    to the effect that the policy shall not apply to injuries sustained by any person employed by the insured "in violation of law as to age, or under the age of 14 years if there is no legal age limit," contemplates a violation of statutory law.

       - In a wrongful death action premised on both negligence and negligence per se filed on behalf of a mother's deceased minor son, a premises owner was properly granted summary judgment, as the independent contractor that hired the decedent, and not the premises owner, had sole control over the contractor's personnel, and the son's hazardous occupation on the owner's premises for a third party did not in and of itself demonstrate that the owner was in violation of Georgia's child labor laws; thus, the appeals court declined to reach the issue of whether an owner who knew or had reason to know that its independent contractor was employing a minor under the age of 16 to perform a dangerous occupation on the owner's premises was in violation of O.C.G.A.

       - In a wrongful death action premised on both negligence and negligence per se filed on behalf of a mother's deceased minor son, a premises owner was properly granted summary judgment as the independent contractor that hired the decedent, and not the premises owner, had sole control over its personnel, and the son's hazardous occupation on the owner's premises for a third party did not in and of itself demonstrate that the owner was in violation of Georgia's child labor laws; thus, the appeals court declined to reach the issue of whether an owner who knew or had reason to know that its independent contractor was employing a minor under the age of 16 to perform a dangerous occupation on the owner's premises was in violation of O.C.G.A.

      RTICLE I. PURPOSE AND POLICY.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose and policy of the party states to cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end that:
     </p>
     <ol class="alpha">
      <li id="t39c04s39-4-4ol1a">
       Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c04s39-4-4ol1b">
       The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c04s39-4-4ol1c">
       The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c04s39-4-4ol1d">
       Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.
       <p>
        As used in this compact:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t39c04s39-4-4ol1d1">
         The name, date and place of birth of the child.

         The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.

         A full statement of the reasons for such proposed action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is proposed to be made.
         <p>
          The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place or care for children.
         </p>
         <p>
          A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to his being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that:

      RTICLE III. CONDITIONS FOR PLACEMENT.
     </p>
     <p>
      No sending agency shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this Article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:
     </p>
     <p>
      Any public officer or agency in a receiving state which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Article may request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency of or in the sending agency's state, and shall be entitled to receive therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it may deem necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      The child shall not be sent, brought or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.

      RTICLE V. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency's state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.
