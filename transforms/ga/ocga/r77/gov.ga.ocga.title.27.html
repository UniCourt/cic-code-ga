       The General Assembly recognizes that hunting and fishing and the taking of wildlife are a valued part of the cultural heritage of the State of Georgia. The General Assembly further recognizes that such activities play an essential role in the state's economy and in funding the state's management programs for game and nongame species alike, and that such activities have also come to play an important and sometimes critical role in the biological management of certain natural communities within this state. In recognition of this cultural heritage and the tradition of stewardship it embodies, and of the important role that hunting and fishing and the taking of wildlife play in the state's economy and in the preservation and management of the state's natural communities, the General Assembly declares that Georgia citizens have the right to take fish and wildlife, subject to the laws and regulations adopted by the board for the public good and general welfare, which laws and regulations should be vigorously enforced. The General Assembly further declares that the state's wildlife resources should be managed in accordance with sound principles of wildlife management, using all appropriate tools, including hunting, fishing, and the taking of wildlife.

       The ownership of, jurisdiction over, and control of all wildlife, as defined in this title, are declared to be in the State of Georgia, in its sovereign capacity, to be controlled, regulated, and disposed of in accordance with this title. Wildlife is held in trust by the state for the benefit of its citizens and shall not be reduced to private ownership except as specifically provided for in this title. All wildlife of the State of Georgia is declared to be within the custody of the department for purposes of management and regulation in accordance with this title. However, the State of Georgia, the department, and the board shall be immune from suit and shall not be liable for any damage to life, person, or property caused directly or indirectly by any wildlife.

         The department has the authority and the responsibility to work with cooperating sportsmen, conservation groups, and others to encourage participation in hunting and fishing at a level to ensure continuation of such activities in perpetuity and no net loss of hunting and fishing opportunity on state owned lands. Further, the department is authorized to promote and encourage hunting, fishing, and other wildlife associated recreation on state managed wildlife areas, public fishing areas, federally owned or managed forests, and other suitable public and private lands of this state.

       To hunt, trap, or fish, as defined in this title, or to possess or transport wildlife is declared to be a right to be exercised only in accordance with the laws governing such right. Every person exercising this right does so subject to the authority of the state to regulate hunting, trapping, and fishing for the public good and general welfare; and it shall be unlawful for any person exercising the right of hunting, trapping, fishing, possessing, or transporting wildlife to refuse to permit authorized employees of the department to inspect and count such wildlife to ascertain whether the requirements of the wildlife laws and regulations are being faithfully complied with. Any person who hunts, traps, fishes, possesses, or transports wildlife in violation of the wildlife laws and regulations violates the conditions under which this right is extended; and any wildlife then on his person or within his immediate possession is deemed to be wildlife possessed in violation of the law and is subject to seizure by the department pursuant to Code Section 27-1-21.

Nothing contained in this Code section shall prohibit municipalities or counties, by ordinance, resolution, or other enactment, from reasonably limiting or prohibiting the discharge of firearms within the boundaries of the political subdivision for purposes of public safety.

       - Sufficient evidence supported the defendant's convictions of felony and misdemeanor obstruction of an officer and driving without carrying a license because the on-duty and uniformed conservation ranger had authority to arrest and was authorized to enforce traffic offenses and the state showed that the ranger was acting within the lawful discharge of official duties when the defendant was asked to turn down the music from the vehicle.

        <p>
       - The fruits of a search of the defendant's premises, by a conservation ranger looking for deer carcasses, conducted with the defendant's consent, were admissible. The legality of such a search was not vitiated because, prior to obtaining consent, the ranger had observed the evidence of the crime by walking around the side of the house. State v. Sutton, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 382</cite>, <cite class="app_court">369 S.E.2d 249</cite> (1988).

       - The probate court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the intoximeter result since a conservation ranger was empowered and authorized, in addition to the ranger's regularly enumerated duties, to exercise the full authority of peace officers.

        <li id="t27c01s27-1-36ol1a1">
         Any person who violates any provisions of this title or any regulations or orders promulgated and administered thereunder shall be liable civilly for a penalty in an amount of up to $1,000.00 for each and every violation thereof, the penalty to be recoverable by a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner by the district attorney of the county in which the alleged violator resides. The commissioner on his motion may or upon complaint of any interested party charging a violation shall refer the matter directly to the district attorney of the county in which the alleged violator resides. The proceeds from all civil penalties arising from enforcement of the wildlife laws, regulations, and orders pursuant to this Code section shall be used in the manner prescribed in Code Section 27-1-14;

         Whenever the commissioner determines that any person has violated any provision of this title or any regulations or orders promulgated under this title, the commissioner may issue an administrative order imposing a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 for the violation. Any person who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any such order shall, upon petition within 30 days after the issuance of such order, have a right to a hearing before an administrative law judge appointed by the Board of Natural Resources. The hearing before the administrative law judge shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," and the rules and regulations adopted by the board pursuant thereto. The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute the final decision of the board and any party to the hearing, including the commissioner, shall have the right of judicial review thereof in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50; or

The judgment shall have the same effect, and all proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same, as though the judgment had been rendered in an action duly heard and determined by the court.

       - Evidence that defendant obtained resident hunting licenses by giving a Georgia address as defendant's legal residence, while a resident of the State of Virginia, evidence of the act of hunting and testimony that defendant had been hunting and had taken a turkey was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction under O.C.G.A.

       Because the defendant acknowledged hunting doves in an open field without a hunting license and "fading" into the woods when the rangers approached, the rangers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity had occurred; consequently, defendant's fourth amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure were not violated and the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial on the charges of illegal hunting and obstruction.

      No fishing license shall be required for any Florida resident who is more than 65 years of age, to the extent that a reciprocal provision exists under Florida law for any Georgia resident who is more than 65 years of age. Florida residents exempted from the requirement of obtaining a fishing license under this Code section shall be entitled to fish in this state without the payment of any fee whatsoever, except that in order to engage in the activities regulated by subsection (a) of Code Section 27-2-6 such a Florida resident must have paid the fee otherwise required for a trout license and must have in his or her possession such proof of such payment as may be prescribed by the department. Florida residents exempted from the requirement of obtaining a fishing license under this Code section are subject to all wildlife laws, rules, and regulations with the exception of provisions requiring fishing licenses. The privileges granted to a Florida resident under this Code section may be suspended or revoked on the same grounds and in the same manner as fishing licenses are suspended and revoked. A Florida resident fishing as authorized by this Code section shall carry upon his or her person proof of his or her age and residence.

       The General Assembly has heretofore found and declared that hunting is a privilege to be exercised only in accordance with the law granting such privilege. The General Assembly now specifically finds and declares that while the act of hunting is an enjoyable and beneficial form of recreation, it can be dangerous not only to the hunter himself but also to other persons if due care is not exercised. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that all persons who refuse or fail to exercise such due care may have their hunting privileges suspended as provided in this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c02s27-2-25.1ol1b">
       Any person engaged in the act of hunting who by the use of a weapon kills or injures another person or persons, whether or not such other person or persons are likewise engaged in the act of hunting, shall notify the department or any appropriate law enforcement officer who shall then notify the department immediately after such occurrence. Any person who fails so to notify the department or such law enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c02s27-2-25.1ol1c">
       Upon notification of such a death or injury, whether by the hunter or by some other person, the department shall immediately initiate an investigation of such incident and submit a report to the commissioner. If the commissioner determines culpable negligence on the part of the person causing the death or injury and that such negligence was the proximate cause of such death or injury, the commissioner may suspend that person's hunting privileges for a specified period of time not to exceed ten years. Any such determination to suspend shall be subject to review as provided for in this Code section. When the commissioner shall decide to suspend said person's hunting privileges, the commissioner must notify such person of said suspension and of his right to a hearing to contest the commissioner's determination. The notification from the commissioner to the person whose license is being suspended shall be by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery with return receipt requested; or, in lieu thereof, notice may be given by personal service upon such person. Upon such notice, any such hunting privileges shall be revoked by such notice and such person shall surrender his or her hunting license, if any, to the department within ten days of such notification. For the purposes of this article, notice given by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery with return receipt requested mailed to the person's last known address shall be prima-facie evidence that such person received the required notice.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c02s27-2-25.1ol1d">
       The person so notified may request an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge appointed by the board within 30 days of receipt of the notice. If no hearing is requested within the 30 day period, the right to a hearing shall have been waived and the hunting privileges of the person shall stand suspended as prescribed by the commissioner's notice. If, following the administrative hearing, there is a determination that such person was negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the death or injury, the hunting privileges of such person may be suspended for a period of up to ten years. The period of time that such privileges are suspended shall be commensurate with the degree of negligence and the severity of the injury. If there is a determination of no negligence or that the negligence was not the proximate cause of the death or injury, the person's hunting privileges shall be restored. The provisions of Code Section 27-2-27 shall not be applicable to a suspension under this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c02s27-2-25.1ol1e">
       Any person whose hunting privileges have been suspended under this Code section and who engages in the act of hunting during such period of suspension shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than 12 months, or both. Any person whose hunting privileges have been suspended under this Code section shall complete a course of instruction in competency and safety in hunting and in the handling of weapons provided for in Code Section 27-2-5 prior to any subsequent exercise of his hunting privileges.

Further, the General Assembly declares its intent to appropriate to the Wildlife Endowment Fund each fiscal year an amount equal to that generated by the prior year's sales of lifetime licenses.

       a)The party states find that:
      </h5>
      <ol>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol11">
        Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol12">
        The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol13">
        The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol14">
        Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol15">
        Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol16">
        The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol17">
        In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state:
        <ol type="A">
         <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol17A">
          Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or
         </li>
         <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol17B">
          If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or
         </li>
         <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol17C">
          Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol18">
        The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol19">
        In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol110">
        The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.
       </li>
       <li id="t27c02s27-2-40ol111">
        The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.
        <p>
         Unless the context requires otherwise, the definitions in this article apply through this compact and are intended only for the implementation of this compact:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It is the policy of the party states to:
      </p>
      <p>
       Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges or rights of any person whose license privileges or rights have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this compact is to:
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.

      </p>
      <p>
       Personal recognizance is acceptable:
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon conviction or failure of a person to comply with the terms of a wildlife citation, the appropriate official shall report the conviction or failure to comply to the licensing authority of the party state in which the wildlife citation was issued. The report shall be made in accordance with procedures specified by the issuing state and shall contain the information specified in the compact manual adopted by the Board of Natural Resources as a rule as minimum requirements for effective processing by the home state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon receipt of the report of conviction or noncompliance required by subdivision (c) of this article, the licensing authority of the issuing state shall transmit to the licensing authority in the home state of the violator the information in a form and content as contained in the compact manual adopted by the Board of Natural Resources as a rule.

       - In order to convict person of hunting on land of another without permission, it is incumbent upon the state to prove that permission to hunt was not obtained from the landowner, lessee, or lessee of the game rights, and where the state proved only that the defendant did not obtain permission from one of the owners, and there was no showing that the owner was the only person empowered to give permission to hunt on the land, the evidence was insufficient for a rational jury to reasonably find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t27c03s27-3-1" target="_self">27-3-1</a></cite>) expressly protected lands of another from trespassing by hunters regardless of whether the game being hunted was specifically protected by that section.

        The state must negate the disjunction
       
       that the landowner or the lessee or the lessee of the game rights gave permission to hunt on the land, which requires a showing that the landowner did not give permission, the lessee (if extant) did not give permission, and the lessee of the game rights (if extant) did not give permission.

        <p>
       - Where the lessee of the game rights had not given the defendants permission to hunt on the property, there was no evidence that another lessee existed and the only other evidence was one defendant's testimony that they had not intended to hunt on private property because they did not have the appropriate hunting license to hunt on such property, this evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under O.C.G.A.

      The General Assembly recognizes that the hunting and taking of wildlife pursuant to this title are a valued cultural heritage consistent with the sound scientific principles of wildlife management and play an essential and effective role in the management of wildlife populations. The General Assembly further recognizes that the State of Georgia and its citizens derive substantial economic, recreational, and esthetic benefits from such activities. Therefore, the General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the public interest to ensure public health, safety, welfare, and conservation of the state's wildlife resources by strictly regulating in this state the use of fertility control on any wildlife.

The department may require proof of residence or ownership or proof of residence and ownership. The affidavit shall acknowledge that the boat sought to be licensed will be subject to Code Section 27-4-137. The affidavit shall be filed by the department in the office of the clerk of the superior court as follows: when the owner is an individual, then in the county where he resides; when the owner is a partnership, corporation, or business entity other than an individual, then in the county of the owner's principal place of business. The affidavit shall be filed by the clerk like other security interests on boats; provided, however, that the filing of such affidavit shall not be permissible where the boat is documented under the laws of the United States.

       The term of the bond provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section shall be for one year and shall correspond to the period of the license. When such a bond has been filed, Code Section 27-4-137 shall not apply to the boat covered by the bond. The commissioner shall have the right to recover on the bond for the breach of its conditions whenever said boat is used in violation of Code Section 27-4-133 or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, either with or without the knowledge, consent, or acquiescence of the owner of the boat.

Until the new bond is filed, any commercial use of the boat shall be unlawful; and the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature.

Such identification shall be at least one inch in height, of a color which contrasts with the color of the float, of block character, and spaced so as to be readable from left to right. The identification shall be assigned by the department to the owner of the trap when the owner is issued his or her commercial crabbing license. For subsequent years, the same identification shall be assigned to such commercial crab fisherman.

The identification shall be at least eight inches in height, of a color which contrasts with the color of the background, of block character, and spaced so as to be readable from left to right. The assigned identification of the boat or vessel being utilized shall correspond to the identification of the float of the trap from which crabs are being taken. No boat or vessel shall be assigned more than one identification in any license year unless such boat or vessel is transferred to another licensed commercial fisherman and such transfer is registered with the department. A crabbing boat or vessel may only employ traps marked with floats with identification issued by the department corresponding to the identification of the boat or vessel being utilized. No identification may be assigned to more than one boat or vessel in any license year, except for replacement vessels as provided in subparagraph (g)(1)(B) of this Code section; provided, however, that one identification number may be assigned to a licensed crabber's primary and alternate vessels, only one of which may be operated for crabbing at any time.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the wild harvest and mariculture of shellfish provide increased seafood production and long-term economic opportunities for coastal Georgia as well as increased ecological benefits to the estuarine environment by promoting natural water filtration and increased fishery habitats. The General Assembly also finds that there exists a public health concern when consuming raw or undercooked shellfish, especially during warm water, summer conditions. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that it is the policy of the state to encourage development of the commercial shellfish industry in ways that protect the public health and are compatible with the environment and with other public uses of the estuarine area, such as navigation, fishing, swimming, and other forms of recreation.

         It shall be unlawful to take or possess shellfish in commercial quantities or for commercial purposes without first having obtained a commercial fishing license with a shellfish endorsement and a master harvester permit or harvester permit or without proof of purchase that such shellfish were purchased from a certified shellfish dealer. Master harvester permits shall specify whether the permittee is authorized to take oysters, clams, or other shellfish and shall only be issued to persons certified by the Department of Agriculture to handle shellfish unless permission to take and possess shellfish has been granted by the department as described in subsection (d) of Code Section 27-4-197 and in Code Section 27-4-202. Such permits shall be provided annually. A permittee may request authorization from the department for employees or agents, who shall be referred to as harvesters, of such permittee to take shellfish from permitted areas. Such request shall be in writing to the department and shall include the name, address, and personal commercial fishing license number of the harvester. It shall be unlawful for harvesters to take or possess shellfish as authorized under their employer's master harvester permit unless they carry on their person while taking or in possession of shellfish a harvester permit as provided by the department indicating the exact area and circumstances allowed for taking. Such harvesters' permits and charts shall be provided annually by the department and shall be in a form as prescribed by the department. Harvesters must possess a valid personal commercial fishing license as provided for in Code Section 27-4-110, a shellfish endorsement as provided for in the department's rules and regulations, and, when a boat is used, a valid commercial fishing boat license as provided in Code Section 27-2-8. Master harvester permits and harvester permits shall not be issued to persons who have violated this part in the two years immediately preceding the filing of an application for a permit. Permits may be revoked pursuant to Code Section 27-2-25. Master harvester permits and harvester permits issued to master harvesters or agents shall be surrendered to the department upon termination of Department of Agriculture certification for handling shellfish, upon termination of right to harvest shellfish, or upon violation of any provision of this title. If a harvester is removed from authorization to take shellfish by the master harvester permittee, the master harvester shall immediately notify the department of such removal.

         The department shall cause to be published once per week for two consecutive weeks in the legal organ of the county or counties in which the area to be bid upon is located an advertisement of an invitation for bid, setting forth a description of the area proposed to be leased; the date, time, and place when and where bids will be received; the minimum acceptable bid as determined by the department but not less than $15.00 per acre; and such other information as the department may deem necessary. Prior to such advertisement, the department shall prepare a proposed form of lease and appropriate instructions which shall be available to prospective bidders under such conditions as the department may prescribe. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the department, and each bid shall be accompanied by a refundable certified check, cashier's check, or money order for the total annual amount of the submitted bid. The funds submitted by the successful bidder will be applied toward the first annual lease payment. In addition, each sealed bid shall be accompanied by a detailed management plan for working the intertidal water bottoms lease area for wild harvest or mariculture. The lease form shall contain provisions regarding the term of the lease, the method of taking shellfish, the time and place for annual payment for the lease which shall be equal to the bid amount, the minimum replanting or production requirements of shellfish to be harvested, the placement and type of signs to mark the site as a leased area, and such other terms as the department deems necessary.

      The General Assembly recognizes that persons who participate in the sport of fishing may incur injuries as a result of the risks involved in such activity. The General Assembly also finds that the state and its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from such activity. The General Assembly finds, determines, and declares that this article is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly to encourage the sport of fishing by limiting the civil liability of those involved in such activity.

For these reasons, the General Assembly further finds and declares that only certain wild animals may be held for scientific or educational purposes, for public exhibition, or as pets and may only be lawfully held when the requirements of this chapter are met. The General Assembly further finds and declares that any wild animal for which a license or permit, or both, is required under the provisions of this chapter and for which no such license or permit, or both, has been obtained is a nuisance and is contraband and is subject to seizure by any peace officer authorized to enforce this chapter.

     <p>
      Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. When enclosures are cleaned by hosing or flushing, adequate measures shall be taken to protect the animals confined in such enclosures from being directly sprayed with the stream of water or wetted involuntarily.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsequent to the presence of an animal with an infectious or transmissible disease, cages, rooms, and hard-surfaced pens or runs shall be sanitized either by washing them with hot water (180 degrees Fahrenheit at source) and soap or detergent, as in a mechanical washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with saturated live steam under pressure. Pens or runs using gravel, sand, or dirt shall be sanitized when necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this Code section. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.

     </p>
     <p>
      Animals shall be observed every day by the person in charge of the care of the animals or by someone working under his direct supervision. Sick, diseased, stressed, injured, or lame animals shall be provided with veterinary care or humanely destroyed, unless such action is inconsistent with the research purposes for which the animal was obtained and is being held.
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) In the case of a research facility, the program of adequate veterinary care shall include the appropriate use of anesthetic, analgesic, or tranquilizing drugs, when such use would be proper in the opinion of the attending veterinarian at the research facility. Such drugs shall be used in accordance with the currently accepted veterinary medical practice as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides and shall produce in the individual subject animal a high level of tranquilization, anesthesia, or analgesia consistent with the protocol or design of the experiment.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be incumbent upon each research facility to provide guidelines and consultation to research personnel with respect to the type and amount of tranquilizers, anesthetics, or analgesics recommended as being appropriate for each species of animal used by that institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      The use of these three classes of drugs shall effectively minimize the pain and discomfort of the animals while under experimentation.
     </p>
     <p>
      HANDLING.
     </p>
     <p>
      Handling of animals shall be done expeditiously and carefully so as not to cause unnecessary discomfort, behavioral stress, or physical harm to the animal. Care should be exercised also to avoid harm to the handler.
     </p>
     <p>
      Animals to which the public is afforded direct contact shall only be displayed for periods of time and under conditions consistent with the animals' health and not leading to their discomfort.
     </p>
     <p>
      During public display, the animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the public with sufficient distance allowed between the animals and the viewing public to assure safety to both the public and the animals. Performing animals shall be allowed a rest period between performances equal to the time for one performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      VEHICLES.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicles used in transporting animals shall be mechanically sound and equipped to provide the animals adequate fresh air, both when moving and stationary, without injurious drafts or discomfort.
     </p>
     <p>
      The animal cargo space shall be so constructed and maintained so as to prevent the ingress of the vehicle's exhaust gases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The interior of the animal cargo space shall be kept physically clean.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ambient temperature shall be sufficiently regulated by heating or cooling to protect the animals from the extremes of temperature and to provide for their health and to prevent their discomfort. The ambient temperature shall not be allowed to fall below or rise above temperatures compatible with the health and comfort of the animals.

     </p>
     <p>
      Primary enclosures, such as compartments used to transport animals, shall be well constructed, well ventilated, and designed to protect the health and assure the safety of the animals. Such enclosures shall be constructed or positioned in the vehicle in such a manner that each animal in the vehicle has access to sufficient air for normal breathing, the openings of such enclosures are easily accessible at all times for emergency removal of the animals, and the animals are afforded adequate protection from the elements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Animals transported in the same primary enclosure shall be compatible. Socially dependent animals (e.g., siblings, dam, and young cagemates) must be allowed visual and olfactory contact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Primary enclosures used to transport animals shall be large enough to ensure that each animal contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments; provided, however, that certain species may be restricted in their movements according to professionally acceptable standards when such freedom of movement would constitute a danger to the animals or their handlers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Animals shall not be placed in primary enclosures over other animals in transit unless each enclosure is fitted with a floor of a material which prevents animal excreta or other wastes from entering lower enclosures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Primary enclosures used to transport animals shall be cleansed and sanitized before and after each shipment. All bedding in the vehicle shall be clean at the beginning of each trip.
