      A nuisance is anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable man.

       <p>
        <p>
       - If the cause of action is one that is traditionally relegated to state law, such as a nuisance action which is a classic area in which state law controls, under the United States Supreme Court's four-pronged test to be applied in analyzing the propriety of allowing a case to be maintained as an implied private right of action under a federal statute not specifically creating such a right, it is inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law; this is especially true now, since the United States Supreme Court has directed the federal courts to concentrate on the second criterion of the four-pronged test, namely, the question of congressional intent to create or deny a right of recovery under the federal law. Noe v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 644 F.2d 434 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">454 U.S. 1126</cite>, <cite class="s_court">102 S.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t41c01s41-1-1" target="_self">41-1-1</a></cite>) is not the test of indictable nuisances under former Penal Code 1910,
   §
   681 (see now O.C.G.A.

        Nuisances are anything that cause hurt,
    inconvenience, or damage to another
       
       and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep the act from being a nuisance. A nuisance is permanent if the damage the act causes is complete when the action creating the nuisance first occurs and gives rise to a single cause of action that initiates the running of the statute of limitation. On the other hand, a nuisance is not permanent if the act causes continuing damage and is one which can and should be abated by the person erecting or maintaining it. In that case, every continuance of the nuisance is a fresh nuisance for which a fresh action will lie and a fresh statute of limitations begins to run. Oglethorpe Power Corp. v. Forrister, <cite class="ga_app_court">303 Ga. App. 271</cite>, <cite class="app_court">693 S.E.2d 553</cite> (2010).

       <p>

       - Act, to constitute a nuisance, must be in violation of some right of the plaintiff. Sheppard v. Georgia Ry. &amp; Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">31 Ga. App. 653</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E. 868</cite> (1924).

        Expression "may otherwise be lawful"
       
       shows that the act complained of, insofar as the act causes "hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another" must be unlawful - that is a violation of some right of plaintiff - to constitute a nuisance. Southern Ry. v. Leonard, <cite class="ga_app_court">58 Ga. App. 574</cite>, <cite class="app_court">199 S.E. 433</cite> (1938); Lawrence v. City of La Grange, <cite class="ga_app_court">63 Ga.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - Notion of "illegality" in Georgia involves much more than failure to comply with some particular directives which may or may not apply to an instrumentality at a given time. A condition may be illegal when it is objectionable only on grounds of causing "hurt or inconvenience," i.e., when it is a nuisance. This conclusion is directly authorized by the statutory definition of nuisance. Banks v. City of Brunswick, 529 F. Supp. 695 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 97 (11th Cir. 1982).

         Distinction between negligence and nuisance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In cause of action brought under nuisance exception to municipal immunity, as to a jury's questions concerning nuisance and the ordinary reasonable man standard found in O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t41c01s41-1-1" target="_self">41-1-1</a></cite>, the only real distinction between negligence and nuisance would seem to be that the latter involves a continued or repeating condition. One may, of course, dispute whether any negligence was involved in design and maintenance of a traffic signal. But, there would appear to be no room at all to doubt that the light was a repeating instrumentality. Thus, if there were negligence in design or maintenance, that negligence would of necessity give rise to a nuisance. Certainly a jury was authorized to so find, particularly in light of police officers' testimony that the light was a known hazard. Banks v. City of Brunswick, 529 F. Supp. 695 (S.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 667 F.2d 97 (11th Cir. 1982).

       Right to use one's property as one pleases implies a like right in every other person, and is qualified by the doctrine that the use in the first instance must be a reasonable one.

       When one acting solely from malevolent motives does injury to one's neighbor, to call such conduct the exercise of an absolute legal right is a perversion of terms. No statute or other rule of law in this state that confers upon an individual a right to maliciously injure another, regardless of what method may be employed to inflict such injury. On the other hand, everyone is entitled to the protection of the law against invasions of one's rights by others. The use of one's own property for the sole purpose of injuring another is not a right that a good citizen would desire nor one that a bad citizen should have. Hornsby v.

        <p>
       - Nuisance is an indirect tort, while a trespass usually is a direct infringement of one's property rights. The distinction between trespass and nuisance consists in the former being a direct infringement of one's right of property, while in the latter the infringement is the result of an act which is not wrongful in itself, but only in the consequences which may flow from the act. In the one case the injury is immediate, in the other it is consequential, and generally results from the commission of an act beyond the limits of the property affected. Groover v. Hightower, <cite class="ga_app_court">59 Ga. App. 491</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 446</cite> (1939); Cannon v. City of Macon, <cite class="ga_app_court">81 Ga.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Concept of nuisance involves repetition or condition causing hurt, inconvenience, or injury. The whole idea of nuisance is that of either a continuous or regularly repetitious act or condition which causes the hurt, inconvenience, or injury. A single isolated occurrence or act, which if regularly repeated would constitute a nuisance, is not a nuisance, until the act is regularly repeated. Leake v.

        <p>
       When one creates a nuisance, and permits the nuisance to remain, it is treated as a continuing wrong, and as giving rise, over and over again, to causes of action. But the principle upon which one is charged as a continuing wrongdoer is that one has a legal right, and is under a legal duty, to terminate the cause of the injury. Keener v.

       Continuing nuisance gives a new cause of action for each day of the nuisance's continued maintenance, and in such a case in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits a court of equity will entertain jurisdiction to enjoin the nuisance and have the nuisance abated. Harbuck v.

       Plaintiff's right to equitable relief was not barred by the statute of limitations on grounds that the nuisance complained of had existed for a period of more than four years prior to the institution of litigation, since when there is a continuing nuisance, a new cause of action arises daily and a court of equity takes jurisdiction in such a case to avoid a multiplicity of suits. Scott v. Dudley, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 565</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 752</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the nuisance lay in the continuing contamination, not in the leaks which originally gave rise to the nuisance, damage was not complete and suit was not barred by the applicable four-year limitations period.

       When a municipality negligently constructs or undertakes to maintain a sewer or drainage system that causes the repeated flooding of property, a continuing abatable nuisance is established, for which the municipality is liable.

       As the home buyers presented evidence that a developer's actions in clearing trees from the adjacent property increased the surface water flow and erosion on their land and made their drainage problem worse, these facts would support a finding of a continuing nuisance.

       Trial court did not err by denying a church's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in a property owner's action for trespass and nuisance on the ground that there was an absence of evidence of negligence or proximate cause linking the church to the owner's injuries because the evidence showed that excess rainwater flowed from the church property onto the owner's property in a continuing manner; even though the church did not cause the initial leak, own the water that leaked, or have any responsibility for the compaction of the soil around the underground utility lines, the jury could find that the initial leak caused a condition on its property that in turn caused continued excessive flooding of the owner's property thereafter.

       - Petition alleging that, at a place of business located on a main thoroughfare, outside the corporate limits of any municipality, beer and wine are being sold, a juke box operated, both day and night, making a loud noise which disturbs and hinders the residents of the neighborhood from sleep, that drunk people congregate and come out of the place cursing, fighting, and making undue noise, and many people of disreputable character gather, and that beer is sold there on Sunday in violation of law, is sufficient to charge the existence of an abatable public nuisance, and therefore stated a cause of action and one which the solicitor-general (now district attorney) could bring proceedings to abate.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Determining factor in an alleged nuisance is not its effect upon persons who are invalids, afflicted with disease, bodily ills, or abnormal physical conditions, or who are of nervous temperament, or peculiarly sensitive to annoyances or disturbances of the character complained of. Warren Co. v. Dickson, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 481</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E. 568</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In the determination of whether a given state of facts discloses a nuisance, the general effect of the condition shown on an ordinary person, rather than one of abnormal sensibilities and feelings, is the proper consideration. Dorsett v. Nunis, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 559</cite>, <cite class="app_court">13 S.E.2d 371</cite> (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Test of whether an act or thing complained of is a nuisance is whether it would be offensive to persons of ordinary feelings and sensibilities, and not those of fastidious taste or temperament.

       While it is no longer required that the plaintiff in a nuisance case show, as the plaintiff had to do at common law, a freehold interest in the property affected by the nuisance, and while the plaintiff no longer need show damage to the realty itself, the plaintiff must still show that the condition is injurious by reason of its relationship to the plaintiff's home or property in the neighborhood where it is located, or else that it is injurious by reason of its constituting an obstruction to streets or sidewalks and like places used by the public generally for passage, which obstructions were at common law regarded as public nuisances because they interfered with the public right of passage.

        <p>
       - In cases of nuisances which cause permanent injury to land, the ordinary rule is that the measure of damages is the depreciation in the market value; in regard to nuisances which are of a nonpermanent, abatable, or temporary nature, the depreciation in the usable or rental value ordinarily furnishes the measure. But, under some circumstances, there may also be a recovery for special damages. Ward v. Southern Brighton Mills, <cite class="ga_app_court">45 Ga. App. 262</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E. 214</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There can be no recovery for damage flowing merely from an improper or defective or negligent construction or maintenance of a public improvement which results in an abatable continuing nuisance on the theory that plaintiff's property has been appropriated by its erection and maintenance. Rhines v. Commissioners of Chatham County, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga. App. 844</cite>, <cite class="app_court">179 S.E. 140</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Damages for depreciation in the market value of property are appropriate in a suit against a municipality for the taking or damaging of property for public use and also in a suit for a permanent and continuing nuisance created by the municipality, recovery of such damages must be had within four years from the date of the original injury. City of La Fayette v. Hegwood, <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 168</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 860</cite> (1935).

       Owner-occupant is entitled to recover damages for annoyance and discomfort temporarily depriving the owner of the unrestricted use and full enjoyment of the owner's premises, in addition to damages for permanent injury to the freehold and for pain and suffering as a result of the maintenance of a nuisance. Shepherd Constr. Co. v. Vaughn, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 647</cite> (1953).

       In the case of a private abatable nuisance, such as the operation of an asphalt mixing plant, the plaintiff is entitled to recover for any direct damage to the plaintiff's person or to the plaintiff's property resulting from the nuisance, accruing within the statute of limitations and up to the filing of the petition. Shepherd Constr. Co. v. Vaughn, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 647</cite> (1953).

       Owner of a dwelling house which the owner occupies as a home is entitled to just compensation for the annoyance and discomfort occasioned by the maintenance, by another, of a nuisance on adjacent premises.

       For damages for permanent injury to property for an unabatable nuisance, there can be but one recovery. "A nuisance, permanent and continuing in its character, the destruction or damage being at once complete upon completion of the act by which the nuisance is created, gives but one right of action, which accrues immediately upon the creation of the nuisance . . . Where the original nuisance to land is of a permanent character so that the damages inflicted thereby are permanent, a recovery not only may, but must, be had for the entire damages in one action; and such damages accrue from the time the nuisance is created, and from that time the statute of limitations begins to run."

Such games or pursuits may, however, become a nuisance per accidens, when there is indecent, disorderly, or improper conduct of the players or spectators; or when, in a residential community, there is accompanying noise, which is excessive and unreasonable, or which recurs at unusual and unreasonable hours of the night, so as to prevent the sleep of ordinary, normal, reasonable persons of the neighborhood.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Purpresture as defined at common law, and recognized in this and other states, is when one encroaches and makes that serviceable to one which belongs to many. Thus, any encroachment upon a public street or highway is a purpresture; and if the public use is impeded or rendered less commodious, such encroachment is generally not only a purpresture, but also technically a public nuisance, regardless of the degree of interference with the common enjoyment. Southeastern Pipe Line Co. v. Garrett ex rel. Le Sueur, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 817</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 753</cite> (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It is not true that every purpresture is a public nuisance. It may or may not be such, according to the particular facts. Although the two may coexist, either may exist without the other. The rule both in reason and by authority is that, unless the public sustain or may sustain some degree of inconvenience or annoyance in the use of a public highway or street or other public property, there is no public nuisance. Southeastern Pipe Line Co. v. Garrett ex rel. Le Sueur, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 817</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 753</cite> (1941).

       - If the relocation of the defendant's track was done under lawful authority, the act would not constitute a nuisance. If the track was relocated in a proper manner and was maintained in a proper manner there was no nuisance. Tracks are laid down for the purpose of operating trains thereon. If the trains are operated in a proper manner, such operation does not constitute a nuisance. Necessarily the running of trains makes some noise and produces some vibrations. Locomotives pulling trains emit some smoke, sparks, and cinders, but these incidental results do not necessarily constitute a nuisance, but are the necessary incidents of the franchise granted a railroad company in connection with the conduct of its business.

       Trial court erred by granting the neighbors' motion for summary judgment in a property owners' action to recover damages arising from smoke emanating from the neighbors' outdoor fireplace because the evidence was sufficient to create a jury question on the issue of whether the smoke from the neighbors' outdoor fireplace would reasonably interfere with an ordinary person's enjoyment of life; the neighbors had a fire in their outdoor fireplace approximately thirty times in a three-year period, and each time, the owners could smell the smoke in their home and suffered from itchy eyes, headaches, scratchy throats, and breathing problems.

        <p>
       - In a wrongful death and nuisance suit wherein the victim was killed while traveling in a taxi cab on a state highway, and the taxi cab had passed a mandatory city inspection the day prior, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the city on the nuisance claim; as a matter of law, the city had no notice of a dangerous condition within the meaning of a nuisance via its inspection as, even though there was evidence in the record that the inspector did not measure tire tread depth, there was no evidence that taxicabs with insufficient tread on their tires routinely passed city inspections and thereafter were involved in collisions that caused injury. Heller v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">659 S.E.2d 617</cite> (2008), aff'd, Ga. DOT v.

       - "Private nuisance" is one limited in its injurious effect to one or a few individuals, which may injure either the person or property or both, and in either case a right of action accrues. Miller v. Coleman, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 313</cite> (1957).
       </p>

        <p>

        Mere violation of an ordinance
       
       does not create a private nuisance. Jillson v. Barton, <cite class="ga_app_court">139 Ga. App. 767</cite>, <cite class="app_court">229 S.E.2d 476</cite> (1975).

       - Creation of a private nuisance is actionable, without regard to the question of negligence. Bonner v. Welborn, <cite class="ga_court">7 Ga. 296</cite> (1849); Exley v. Southern Cotton Oil Co., 151 F. 101 (S.D. Ga. 1907).

       - Language in this section is not used in the sense that every person in the area must have been actually hurt or injured in order to show a public nuisance. Atlanta Processing Co. v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">227 Ga. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">179 S.E.2d 752</cite> (1971).

       - Trial court correctly entered summary judgment against the mothers on their public nuisance count because the evidence did not show that all members of the public who came into contact with the river were injured and, thus, the mother's public nuisance cause of action was effectively erased. During the decades prior to the deaths, no other person had ever drowned when entering the river via the boat ramp, whether during power generation or otherwise, and the other six boys who accompanied the decedents into the water on the ramp that day were uninjured. White v. Ga. Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">265 Ga. App. 664</cite>, <cite class="app_court">595 S.E.2d 353</cite> (2004).

       - Maintenance of a gaming house or a gaming place is a public nuisance. Gullatt v. State ex rel.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Plaintiff's disposal of the plaintiff's chemicals at a specified site did not amount to creation of a public nuisance since: (1) any contamination of the property caused by the plaintiff did not affect a common right of all members of the public, such as the right to clean air or clean water, and (2) it was not shown that the rights of more than a few individuals were affected by the contamination.

        Landing and steps of a church,
       
       though allegedly so negligently constructed as to be hazardous to life and limb, do not constitute a public nuisance since there is no right common to all of the public to use the steps and landing of a church of a particular denomination. Cox v. DeJarnette, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 664</cite>, <cite class="app_court">123 S.E.2d 16</cite> (1961).

       - In view of evidence that a property owner's private road impeded the necessary passage of a city's emergency personnel so as to significantly endanger the health and safety of those persons residing at apartment complexes adjacent to the road, the owner was improperly granted summary judgment in the city's suit seeking abatement of a public nuisance under O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Constant and repeated violations of former statutes relating to the business of buying wages or salaries, and to the small-loan business, with threats to continue the businesses, do not amount to such a public nuisance as may be abated and prevented by a suit in the name of the state. State ex rel. Boykin v. Ball Inv. Co., <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 382</cite>, <cite class="app_court">12 S.E.2d 574</cite> (1940).

       </h5>
       <p>
        - In a wrongful death case, the trial court properly denied a city summary judgment as although the city could continue to assert that no nuisance existed because there was only one prior documented accident at the intersection due to the obstruction, genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the tree constituted a nuisance, which had to be resolved by a jury.

        All injury to health is special,
       
       and necessarily limited in its effect to the individual affected, and is, in its nature, irreparable. It matters not that others within the sphere of the operation of the nuisance, whether public or private, may be affected likewise. De Vaughn v.

        <p>
       - Landowner may maintain a suit in equity to enjoin further interference with the landowner's means of egress to and ingress from the public highway, when such interference amounts to a continuing nuisance or trespass, and when an injunction would prevent a multiplicity of suits. Barham v. Grant, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 601</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 43</cite> (1937).

       Damages for one whose means of egress from and ingress to one's property abutting on a public highway is illegally and unnecessarily interfered with may be the depreciation in market value, if the obstruction is a permanent one, or the damage to business and loss of profits. Punitive damages may be recovered if the circumstances are such as to justify the allowance thereof. Holland v.

       - Allegations of petition seeking to enjoin an alleged nuisance in operating an asphalt and cement-mixing and manufacturing plant as to the spilling of concrete and asphalt in a public street and its effect on persons walking along the street related to a public nuisance, and stating no special damage, showed no cause of action. Asphalt Prods. Co. v. Beard, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 610</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 172</cite> (1940).

       Allegations of petition in which petitioners sought equitable relief "as individuals, citizens, and taxpayers" from the closing of a railroad crossing were insufficient to show special damage to petitioners, or any damage not shared equally by all other "individuals, citizens, and taxpayers," and the petition was therefore insufficient for the grant of any relief to the petitioners as individuals, citizens, and taxpayers.

       - To maintain an action for an injury received from an obstruction in a highway, two things must concur: an obstruction in the road by the fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid the obstruction on the part of the plaintiff. Branan v. May, <cite class="ga_court">17 Ga. 136</cite> (1855).

       <p>
        <p>
       If the owner of adjoining property suffers special damage from the unlawful running of cars in a public street, this entitled the owner to maintain an action. Kavanagh v. Mobile &amp; G.R.R., <cite class="ga_court">78 Ga. 271</cite>, <cite class="app_court">2 S.E. 636</cite> (1887).

       Right of a municipality to grant a person the power to obstruct a street is dependent on legislative authority, hence, the unauthorized obstruction of a street furnishing an avenue of approach to one's place of business is actionable.

       - Old rule, maintained by some authorities, that coming to a nuisance will prevent a person so coming from making any complaint, has long since been exploded. Miller v. Coleman, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 313</cite> (1957).

        One who purchases land adjoining a private nuisance

       Charge that plaintiffs had the right to move near a kennel though the plaintiffs knew the kennel was a nuisance, and could rely on the presumption that the nuisance would be abated and stopped, was not erroneous.

         Recovery for both personal and property damage.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Damages for discomfort and annoyance caused to the owner and the owner's family are separate and distinct from damage to the value of the realty and do not constitute a double recovery for a single injury. In an action for nuisance, the property owners may recover for both damage to person and damage to property. City of Atlanta v. Murphy, <cite class="ga_app_court">194 Ga. App. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">391 S.E.2d 474</cite> (1990); Arvida/JMB Partners v. Hadaway, <cite class="ga_app_court">227 Ga. App. 335</cite>, <cite class="app_court">489 S.E.2d 125</cite> (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since the owners' evidence of repeated flooding established an abatable nuisance, an award of both personal and property damages as well as attorney's fees was adequate; the trial court's jury charge was proper and the court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. City of Gainesville v. Waters, <cite class="ga_app_court">258 Ga. App. 555</cite>, <cite class="app_court">574 S.E.2d 638</cite> (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a nuisance suit brought by a property owner against the City of Atlanta, involving the city failing to properly maintain a storm pipe that traversed and served the property owner's land which resulted in extensive flooding of the land and the home, the trial court properly awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $300,000 and that amount was not excessive, as a matter of law, as there was evidence that the property owner suffered special damages in the amount of $203,376, including loss of personal property, diminution in the value of the property, and rental expenses incurred when the property owner was forced to move from the home. There was also sufficient evidence to support an award of damages for personal injuries and damages for annoyance and discomfort. City of Atlanta v. Hofrichter, <cite class="ga_app_court">291 Ga. App. 883</cite>, <cite class="app_court">663 S.E.2d 379</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Homeowners could recover for both the homeowners' discomfort and annoyance caused by the alleged nuisance and for the diminution in the homeowners' property value because the former was designed to compensate the homeowners for what the homeowners had already experienced as residents of the property due to the factory, while future discomfort and annoyance is reflected in the diminished fair market value of the property. Toyo Tire N. Am. Mfg. v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">299 Ga. 155</cite>, <cite class="app_court">787 S.E.2d 171</cite> (2016).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because the jury heard evidence of the defendant's interference with plaintiff's right to enjoy possession of the plaintiff's property and the plaintiff's discomfort and annoyance and the unobjected to jury form specifically authorized general damages, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in rejecting the claim of excessiveness. Woodmen of the World v. Jordan, <cite class="ga_app_court">231 Ga. App. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">499 S.E.2d 900</cite> (1998).

       Landowners of a lakefront property created a nuisance when they went onto a corporation's dam and plugged the weakened dam to prevent a lake from draining.

       - Evidence supported a jury's verdict that there was a change in the nature of the noises produced by a power plant that used gas-fired combustion turbine units, sufficient to allow nearby landowners to bring nuisance claims that were timely under O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Summary judgment was properly granted to a county on an inverse condemnation claim filed by four property owners as the county did not either create or maintain a construction project that allegedly created a nuisance that harmed the owners since a city owned and maintained the nuisance property, the county exercised no control over the properties, and the county could not be deemed to have performed a continuous act that caused the owners' harm; while the county bid out the construction contract, the county had no role in designing the plans for the contractor to use on the project or in supervising the contractor's work and the owners did not show that the county official performed any action beyond passing on an inquiry between the Georgia Department of Transportation and the city. Reidling v. City of Gainesville, <cite class="ga_app_court">280 Ga. App. 698</cite>, <cite class="app_court">634 S.E.2d 862</cite> (2006).

       - Notice to an alienee that the alienee will be held responsible for any damages subsequently caused by the nuisance will suffice in lieu of a specific request to abate. Central R.R. v.

       It is error to charge that a lessee need not receive notice when the evidence conflicted on the question of whether the lessee had increased the nuisance. Seaboard &amp; R.R.R. v. Ambrose, <cite class="ga_court">122 Ga. 47</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E. 815</cite> (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Before a cause of action for maintenance of a nuisance arises against alienee of nuisance, there must be a notice of the existence of the nuisance, or a request to abate the nuisance, given to alienee; mere passive knowledge of the existence of the nuisance by alienee is not sufficient. Georgia Power Co. v. Fincher, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 524</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 109</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While an action will lie without notice against one who erects and maintains a nuisance, notice is a prerequisite against one who merely acquires property on which there is an existing nuisance, passively permits the nuisance's continuance, and adds nothing thereto. Georgia Power Co. v. Moore, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 411</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 520</cite> (1933).
       </p>

       Maintenance of the nuisance after notice is continuance of the nuisance, and the alienee of the property causing the nuisance is responsible for that continuance, if there is a request for abatement before action is filed.

       Trial court correctly determined that a property owner's failure to provide ante litem notice to an apartment owner prohibited the property owner from pursuing nuisance claims because, pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t41c01s41-1-5ol1b" target="_self">41-1-5(b)</a></cite>, the property owner was required to provide the apartment owner with notice of the nuisance or a request to abate prior to filing suit unless it did anything to increase the nuisance; the apartment owner acquired the property after detention ponds had been built and after storm water runoff from the property had already become problematic on the property owner's land, and the property owner presented no evidence that the apartment altered the property or took any other affirmative action to increase the nuisance.

        <p>
       - Grantee or alienee of property causing a nuisance is not liable for damages caused by its continued maintenance and accruing prior to a notice or request to abate; but it is also the rule that when the alienee of property on which is situated a nuisance does anything to increase the nuisance, the alienee may be sued without notice to abate. Savannah Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Horton, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 578</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E. 299</cite> (1932).

       <p>
        <p>
       While notice is required to one who merely purchases land and fails to remove a nuisance created by another, yet it is not necessary to an alienee, who knowingly does some additional act to actively maintain and use a nuisance originally created by another, or does something to increase the existing nuisance or its injurious effects, and thus creates in effect a fresh nuisance.

       - Upon the trial of a suit against alienee of a nuisance to recover damages for maintenance of the nuisance, which arises out of the construction of the dam which alienee's predecessor in title had erected, and which alienee had not altered, it was error for the court to instruct jury that, if the agent of the defendant in charge of the dam as superintendent is the same person who had held the same position with the defendant's predecessor in title, and who, as superintendent for latter, had notice of the existence of the nuisance, knowledge by one of this fact constituted notice to the defendant of the existence of the nuisance.

       It is the declared policy of the state to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural and forest land and facilities for the production or distribution of food and other agricultural products, including without limitation forest products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural or agriculture-supporting industrial or commercial areas or forest land or when there are changed conditions in or around the locality of an agricultural facility or agricultural support facility, such operations often become the subject of nuisance actions. As a result, such facilities are sometimes forced to cease operations. Many others are discouraged from making investments in agricultural support facilities or farm improvements or adopting new related technology or methods. It is the purpose of this Code section to reduce losses of the state's agricultural and forest land resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural facilities and operations or agricultural support facilities may be deemed to be a nuisance.

        <p>
       - Statutory definition of a nuisance is not vague and indefinite and therefore unconstitutional. Atlanta Processing Co. v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">227 Ga. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">179 S.E.2d 752</cite> (1971).

        Section defines an indictable nuisance,
       
       and was evidently intended not to authorize the abatement of an act which was not indictable, but to authorize the abatement of indictable nuisances of peculiar virulence, without waiting for an indictment. Vason v. South Carolina R.R., <cite class="ga_court">42 Ga. 631</cite> (1871).

        <p>
       - While this section, in terms, provides only for the abatement of a public nuisance, in the manner therein specified, it has been several times held that a private nuisance may be abated under its operation provided the application is made by the party injured. Ruff v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">50 Ga. 130</cite> (1873); Salter v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_court">55 Ga. 310</cite> (1875); Hart v.

       - While petitioners were not entitled to all the relief prayed for, or to an injunction against the operation of the defendant's service station business when conducted in a normal manner accompanied by no more noises than were reasonably necessary, yet the petitioners would be entitled to injunctive relief against unusual and unnecessary noises, provided the proof showed that the operation of the business was attended with such unusual and unnecessary noises, as distinguished from those disturbances and noises which were normal and of the character usually attendant upon the operation of the business of operating a filling station and garage for repairs. Wilson v. Evans Hotel Co., <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 155</cite> (1939).

       Nuisance being an indirect tort, there is no presumption of damages from its maintenance; and the plaintiff, in order to recover must show the fact of the nuisance and consequent damages. Crane v. Mays, <cite class="ga_app_court">70 Ga. App. 66</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 347</cite> (1943).

       Petition alleging that the plaintiff purchased a described tract of land, and at the same time acquired an easement adjacent thereto over a lane as a means of ingress and egress from the public road to the plaintiff's farm, that the plaintiff had used this land without interruption since the date the land was acquired until the defendant obstructed the land by placing a "cattle gap" across the land, that such obstruction had interfered with the plaintiff's movement of cattle along that lane to a pasture, thereby causing the plaintiff much inconvenience, trouble, and injury to the plaintiff's cattle, and thereby depriving the plaintiff's family of necessary milk and food, stated a cause of action for injunctive relief. Ozbolt v. Miller, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 558</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 601</cite> (1950).

      Private citizens may not generally interfere to have a public nuisance abated.

        <p>
       - Private citizen specially damaged by a public nuisance may proceed in the citizen's own name and behalf to have the nuisance abated under former Civil Code 1895,
   §§
   4761 and 4766 (see now O.C.G.A.
   §§
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t41c02s41-2-2" target="_self">41-2-2</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t41c02s41-2-3" target="_self">41-2-3</a></cite>). Savannah, F. &amp; W. Ry. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Private citizens cannot generally interfere to have a public nuisance enjoined. Sammons v. Sturgis, <cite class="ga_court">145 Ga. 663</cite>, <cite class="app_court">89 S.E. 774</cite> (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Generally, a public nuisance gives to any individual no right of action for injunction, but the nuisance must be abated by a process instituted in the name of the state. Albany Theater, Inc. v. Short, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 57</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 895</cite> (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If operation of a picture show on the Sabbath amounts to a public nuisance, such nuisance may be abated in the manner provided by law, or the nuisance may be enjoined upon an information filed by the solicitor general (now district attorney), but an injunction will not be granted at the instance of a private citizen unless one has sustained special injury. American Legion v. Miller, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 754</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 837</cite> (1937); Crane v. Mays, <cite class="ga_app_court">70 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       All injury to health is special, and necessarily limited in its effect to the individual affected, and is, in its nature, irreparable. It matters not that others within the sphere of the operation of the nuisance, whether public or private, may be affected likewise. Hunnicutt v. Eaton, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 485</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E. 919</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While generally a private citizen may not have a public nuisance enjoined, such nuisance may be abated on the application of a citizen specially injured. Harbuck v. Richland Box Co., <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 883</cite> (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Allegations of petition in which petitioners sought equitable relief "as individuals, citizens, and taxpayers" from the closing of a railroad crossing were insufficient to show special damage to petitioners, or any damage not shared equally by all other "individuals, citizens, and taxpayers," and the petition was therefore insufficient for the grant of any relief to the petitioners as individuals, citizens, and taxpayers. State Hwy. Dep't v. Reed, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 197</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 561</cite> (1954).

       - Lewd house being per se a public nuisance, a court of equity has jurisdiction to abate the nuisance on a suit brought by the district attorney on the information of a citizen as a relator, without alleging or proving special injury to property. Edison v. Ramsey, <cite class="ga_court">146 Ga. 767</cite>, <cite class="app_court">92 S.E. 513</cite> (1917).
       </p>

       District attorney is not authorized to act on the information of citizens, except in case of a public nuisance. Southeastern Pipe Line Co. v. Garrett ex rel. Le Sueur, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 817</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 753</cite> (1941).

       In order for a solicitor general (now district attorney) to proceed for the public, on information filed with the solicitor by citizens, to enjoin a nuisance, the object which it is sought to enjoin must be a public nuisance.

       - Court of equity will not entertain a bill in the name of one or more private citizens to restrain a public nuisance, no private injury or threatened injury being alleged to such citizens or to their property. In such a case, the nuisance being a purely public one, can only be restrained by the public, on information filed by a public officer, to wit: by the solicitor general (now district attorney) for the Circuit. This holding is declaratory of the common-law rule which is universally adopted and quite uniform. Mayor of Columbus v. Jaques, <cite class="ga_court">30 Ga. 506</cite> (1860).

       Court of equity will only exercise the power to restrain the erection of a building, and the maintenance therein, after construction, of a lawful business, on the ground that the operation of such business will constitute a nuisance, when it is made to appear with reasonable certainty that such operation necessarily constitutes a nuisance, the consequences of which will be irreparable in damages. Powell v. Garmany, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 550</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 781</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>

        If the injury is either irreparable or continuing,
       
       an injunction will be granted. Farley v. Gate City Gas Light Co., <cite class="ga_court">105 Ga. 323</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E. 193</cite> (1898).

       Nuisance may be abated in equity if the hurt or damage is irreparable or continuing. Isley v.

        Injunction will be granted when the damages can be ascertained,
       
       and all rights finally adjudicated in one action. Wheeler v. Steele, <cite class="ga_court">50 Ga. 24</cite> (1873); Powell v. Foster, <cite class="ga_court">59 Ga. 790</cite> (1877).

        Continuing nuisance gives a new cause of action for each day of its continued maintenance,
       
       and in such a case, in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits, a court of equity will entertain jurisdiction to enjoin the nuisance and also have the nuisance abated. Albany Theater, Inc. v. Short, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 57</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 895</cite> (1930).

        <p>
       - Allegation of "mere speculative or contingent injuries, with nothing to show that they will in fact happen," will not support a prayer to enjoin a nuisance. Harrison v.

        <p>
       Mere apprehension of irreparable injury from an alleged nuisance, consisting of a house in course of construction for a lawful business use, is not sufficient to authorize an injunction. If it be a nuisance, the consequences must be to a reasonable degree certain. Thrasher v.

       Allegations of mere speculative or contingent injuries, with nothing to show that in fact the injuries will happen, are insufficient to support a prayer for injunctive relief. Powell v. Garmany, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 550</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 781</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Mere apprehension of injury, based on the assumption that a lawful business not then in operation will be operated in the future in an improper manner, so as to become a nuisance, is not sufficient to authorize equity to enjoin the erection of a building wherein such business is to be carried on. Powell v. Garmany, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 550</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 781</cite> (1951).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a petition fails to show the facts from which it appears with reasonable certainty that the operation of the business will work hurt, inconvenience, and damage, it falls just short of alleging a nuisance per accidens against which an injunction should be granted. Griffith v. Newman, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 533</cite>, <cite class="app_court">123 S.E.2d 723</cite> (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While mere apprehension of injury and damage is insufficient, if it is made to appear with reasonable certainty that irreparable harm and damage will occur from the operation of an otherwise lawful business amounting to a continuing nuisance, equity will restrain the construction, maintenance, or operation of such lawful business. Isley v. Little, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 586</cite>, <cite class="app_court">124 S.E.2d 80</cite> (1962), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 23</cite>, <cite class="app_court">131 S.E.2d 623</cite> (1963); Camp v.

       Trial court properly declined to permanently enjoin the defendants from using their property as a public motocross track. The defendants closed the track to the public before the plaintiffs filed suit, and the plaintiffs did not establish to a reasonably certain degree under O.C.G.A.

       It is an exercise of judicial power,
      
      to determine what is by law a nuisance and only those things which are by the common or statute law declared to be nuisances per se, or which in their very nature are such, may be summarily suppressed.

       When there is a continuing nuisance, which plaintiffs allege will cause sickness, the remedy provided under this section does not furnish an ample and complete remedy for the plaintiffs. Poultryland, Inc. v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 549</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 785</cite> (1946).

       If alleged conduct constituted a continuing nuisance under former Code 1933,
   §
   72-101 (see now O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t41c01s41-1-1" target="_self">41-1-1</a></cite>), the plaintiff was entitled to equitable relief. Poultryland, Inc. v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 549</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 785</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Petition alleging that a nuisance was a continuing one and injuriously affected the comfort and health of the petitioners in described particulars, and alleging that unless enjoined would cause irreparable damage to petitioners and result in a multiplicity of suits, was not subject to the ground of demurrer that it showed on its face that the petitioners had an adequate remedy at law. Poultryland, Inc. v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 549</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 785</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since a continuing nuisance was alleged, and since a continuing nuisance may be enjoined by a court of equity it was not error for the trial court to overrule the plea to the jurisdiction, wherein it was asserted that, by virtue of this section the mayor and city council of Springfield had jurisdiction to abate a nuisance in the form of a previously erected obstruction to a private way within the corporate limits of a city of less than 20,000 population. Rahn v. Pittman, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 523</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 85</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In situations where there is a continuing nuisance, this section does not afford an adequate remedy at law and a court of equity will entertain jurisdiction to enjoin the nuisance and have the nuisance abated. City of Atlanta v. Wolcott, <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 244</cite>, <cite class="app_court">240 S.E.2d 83</cite> (1977).

Such ordinances shall include at least the following provisions:

If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by Code Section 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the county or municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court.

Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to Code Section 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:

The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket.

The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of Code Section 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with Code Section 48-5-359.1.

      <li id="t41c02s41-2-9ol1d">
       Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under Code Section 5-3-29.

       In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this Code section.

       - In a proceeding to abate as a nuisance a described tourist camp owned by the defendant on the ground that "said place and its contents" were being knowingly maintained and used by the defendant for the purpose of lewdness, assignation, and prostitution, when the judge, by consent trying the case, without a jury, found and decreed that all of the buildings in the tourist camp, with the personalty in each, were used by the defendant "as one plant or combine" for the purpose of lewdness and prostitution, the defendant, after an affirmance of such judgment by the Supreme Court, could not obtain a modification of the judgment so as to release one of the buildings and the building's contents, by showing that this part of the tourist camp was in no way connected with the alleged nuisance; the original finding and decree as to this matter being conclusive.
