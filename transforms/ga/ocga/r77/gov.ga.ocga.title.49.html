      The Department of Human Services is empowered to institute appropriate proceedings for injunction in the courts of competent jurisdiction in this state for the purpose of enjoining a violation of any provision of a residential child care licensing law as now existing or as may be hereafter amended or of any regulation or order duly issued by the board or department. The department is also empowered to maintain action for injunction to abate any public nuisance which is injurious to the public health, safety, or comfort. Such actions may be maintained notwithstanding the fact that such violation also constitutes a crime and notwithstanding that other adequate remedies at law exist. Such actions may be instituted in the name of the department in the county in which a violation of any provision of this title occurs.

       - If the commissioner determines that the local concern and reaction to the selection of the recommended applicant, arising not from the applicant's race or other impermissible criteria but from the public's perception of the applicant's ability to render them impartial service, would proximately result in the diminution of effectiveness to run the department, and would result in an adverse public image for the county and state departments, the commissioner should not be required to ignore such considerations in the commissioner's capacity as appointing authority.

A record must be retained beyond the three-year period as long as a federal or state audit of that record is in progress, or if an audit's findings have not been resolved, or if the case in question is the subject of pending administrative or judicial litigation.

     <p>
      The department may examine any books, papers, or memoranda reflecting the income of, or financial records bearing upon the determination of the eligibility of, recipients in instances of alleged fraud by recipients of food stamps and public assistance. This process may be implemented by means of a subpoena which may be issued by the commissioner of human services, upon the advice of the State Department of Law. In order to consider the issuance of such subpoenas, the director of the department's office of fraud and abuse must personally make application in writing to the commissioner of human services specifying why such information is necessary. If issued, such subpoenas shall compel the production of relevant documents. Subpoenas shall be served in the same manner as if issued by a superior court. If any person fails to obey a subpoena issued and served under this Code section with respect to any matter germane to the department's investigation, on application of the department, through the commissioner of human services or the commissioner's duly authorized representative, the superior court of the county in which the documents were required to be produced may issue an order requiring the person to comply with the subpoena and to produce the relevant documents.

       <p>
        - Restrictions on reimbursement for abortions contained in Georgia's rules amount to a denial or reduction of a required service to an otherwise eligible recipient solely because of that eligible recipient's condition, i.e., pregnancy, and furthermore, these restrictions are not based on medical necessity or utilization control procedures nor is any contention made by the defendants that the abortions sought by the plaintiffs were not medically necessary or presented utilization control problems; therefore, under 42 C.F.R.
   §
   440.230(c) the Georgia Department of Medical Assistance (now Department of Community Health) must provide reimbursement for these medically necessary abortions. Doe v. Busbee, 481 F. Supp. 46 (N.D. Ga. 1979).

       The General Assembly finds that the department frequently must pay more for prescription drugs furnished to recipients of medical assistance under this article than certain health care providers pay for the same products. In order to control more effectively the costs of such drugs, the department may establish a Medicaid Prescription Drug Bidding and Rebate Program as provided in this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-4-152.1ol1b">
       The department may request sealed bids from prescription drug manufacturers for both brand name and generic equivalent prescription drugs specified by the department. The bids shall be proposed agreements by these manufacturers to adjust prices of drugs specified by the department to a price designated as the bid price when those drugs are supplied to recipients of medical assistance under this article. If the department has accepted a bid for a drug under this Code section, the department may not reimburse a provider of such drug for any equivalent drug not so successfully bid during the term of the contract awarded with regard to the drug so bid. The department may elect not to reimburse for any multisource drugs of a drug manufacturer which does not participate in the bid process or which bids prices considered excessive by the department.

       All prescription drugs for which bids are submitted must meet applicable standards of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, the State Board of Pharmacy, and be guaranteed as meeting all requirements, regulations, and comparison data under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations thereunder. The manufacturer of a drug which is bid must have an FDA approved New Drug Application or an abbreviated New Drug Application and must have a product liability insurance policy extending to pharmacy providers under this article, but the policy may condition coverage thereunder upon the provider's complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder.

       Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to change the practice of pharmacies having provider agreements under this article with respect to their purchases and sales of and reimbursements for drugs furnished to recipients of medical assistance under this article.

      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-4-152.1ol1e">
       In the event no acceptable bids are received for a drug for which a request for bid was made, the department may select a single drug supplier for the drug or establish one price for such drug which the department will reimburse therefor, but this shall not restrict the department from establishing one price for any drug upon which the department does not request bids.

       - Decision of the department of community health (DCH) interpreting the phrase "last approved cost report" as used in the DCH's policies and procedures manual for purposes of computing an owner's reimbursement rate was not entitled to judicial deference because the phrase was not used in a statute, rule, or regulation, but rather in the manual, the terms of which had not undergone the scrutiny afforded a statute during the legislative process or the adoption process.

        Exhaustion of administrative remedies.
       
       Commissioner of the Department of Community Health, members of the board of that Department, and the Director of the Department's Division of Medical Assistance could not avoid judicial review for want of exhaustion of administrative remedies when the very rules of the department precluded both hearing and a remedy sought by a Medicaid-eligible woman; moreover, no adequate administrative remedy existed which the woman could have exhausted.

   §
   1396 et seq., and because the plaintiff classes will suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate legal remedy, the defendants, the defendants' agents and employees, must be permanently enjoined from refusing to provide Medicaid reimbursement to the members of the plaintiff classes for the provision of all medically necessary abortions.

   "The General Assembly recognizes that the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the Georgia Medicaid program can and does cause the state treasury to incur serious financial losses which results in direct harm to the taxpayers of this state.
   This Act is intended to provide a partial remedy for this problem by providing specific procedures whereby this state, and private citizens acting for and on behalf of this state, may bring civil actions against persons and entities who have obtained state funds through the submission of false or fraudulent claims to state agencies. This Act, in its provision for double and sometimes treble damages, is remedial in purpose, and is intended not to punish, but insofar as possible to make the state treasury whole for both the direct and indirect losses caused by the submission of false or fraudulent claims resulting in payments by this state or state agencies.
   By receiving a portion of the recovery in civil actions brought under this article, 'whistle blowers' are encouraged to come forward when they have information about the submission of false claims to the Georgia Medicaid program, and rewarded when their initiative results in civil recoveries for this state."

If the person bringing the civil action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of Code Section 49-4-168.1, such person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the civil action.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that changes in the approval process of certain health care programs have made it difficult for children with disabilities who are eligible for medical assistance pursuant to Article 7 of this chapter to receive the services to which they are entitled with the frequency and within the time periods which are appropriate. Separate administration of the categorically needy and the medically fragile programs should not result in any variation in the amount, duration, and scope of services. Redundant paperwork requirements have hampered service approvals and delivery and reduced the number of providers serving children. It is the intent of this article to ensure that children with disabilities receive the medically necessary therapy services to which they are entitled under the Medicaid Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Program and that categorically needy and medically fragile children have available to them the same scope, duration, and amount of services. It is also the intent of this article to simplify the process and paperwork by which occupational, speech, and physical therapy services are applied for and received by eligible recipients.

      The schedule of assistance to be paid to a recipient family under this article shall eliminate the increment in benefits under the Georgia TANF Program as a result of the birth of a child during the period in which the family is eligible for TANF assistance or during a temporary period in which the family or recipient is ineligible for TANF assistance pursuant to a sanction imposed for failure to comply with eligibility requirements, subsequent to which the family or recipient is again eligible for assistance. The recipient family in which the recipient parent gives birth to an additional child during the recipient's period of eligibility for TANF assistance, or during a temporary period of ineligibility for assistance, may not receive additional assistance, except in the case of a general increase in the amount of TANF assistance which is provided to all program recipients. This provision shall only apply to recipient families who have been in receipt of cash assistance under this article for a total of ten months after May 1, 1997. Nothing in this Code section shall be considered to disqualify a recipient family from an incremental increase in assistance in cases in which the birth of a child is the result of a verifiable rape or incest.

If such delinquent child is ordered conveyed to the department, the court shall assign an officer or other suitable person to convey such child to any facility designated by the department, provided that the person assigned to convey a girl must be female. The cost of conveying such child committed to the department to the facility designated by the department shall be paid by the county from which such child is committed, provided that no compensation shall be allowed beyond the actual and necessary expenses of the party conveying and the child conveyed.

Such reexaminations may be made as frequently as the department considers desirable, and every such child shall be reexamined at intervals not exceeding one year. Failure of the department to examine such a child committed to it or to reexamine him or her within one year of a previous examination shall not of itself entitle such child to discharge from control of the department but shall entitle such child to petition the committing court for an order of discharge; and the court shall discharge him or her unless the department, upon due notice, satisfies the court of the necessity of further control.

      <h5>
       ARTICLE I.
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       PURPOSE.
      </h5>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;
      </p>
      <p>
       Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;
      </p>
      <p>
       Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;
      </p>
      <p>
       Insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;
      </p>
      <p>
       Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;
      </p>
      <p>
       Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

       </span>
       1) If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the by-laws or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
      </h5>
      <p>
       Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative Dispute Resolution;

      <p>
       Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the by-laws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or the Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the by-laws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission by-laws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of such termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.

       Section C. Judicial Enforcement

       </span>
       The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and by-laws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.

      <h5>
       Section D. Dissolution of Compact
       <span class="headbreak">

       Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the by-laws.

   §
   2/HB 670, provides that the 2018 amendment becomes effective if a legislative branch representative is appointed and serving on the Georgia State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision on June 30, 2018, then the amendment shall become effective upon the termination of his or her term of service.
   Furthermore, if a legislative branch representative has not been appointed and is not serving on such council on June 30, 2018, then the amendment shall become effective on July 1, 2018.
   This Code section, as set out above, does not reflect the amendment by that Act owing to the delayed effective date.
   As of May 2018, this contingency had not been met.
   After the contingency is met, paragraph (1) will read as follows:
   "(1)
   The Governor shall by executive order establish the initial composition, terms, and compensation of the Georgia State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision required by Article IX of that compact, with the Governor making the appointments to those positions; provided, however, that there shall be two representatives from the legislative branch of government and one representative from the judicial branch of government who shall be appointed as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(A)
   The Speaker of the House of Representatives shall make one appointment of a legislative branch representative;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(B)
   The President of the Senate shall make one appointment of a legislative branch representative; and
      </p>

   The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall make one appointment of a judicial branch representative;".

        <p>
       - Visitation rights of a parent of a child in the custody of the Department of Family and Children Services are a residual "parental tie" which is not severed by the mere placement of the child in the temporary custody of the department without a specific finding as to that right. In re K.B., <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 199</cite>, <cite class="app_court">372 S.E.2d 476</cite> (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Once temporary legal custody of a child was placed in the department under a shelter care order, the sole right to determine where and with whom the child would live vested with the department; the direction of the trial court to remove the child from the father's home was not binding, and the trial court's later contempt finding based on this order was improper.

       Ga. L. 1993, p. 1969,
   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly estimates that up to $6 million will be saved on an annual basis when the provisions of Code Sections 49-4-112, 49-4-113, and 49-4-115 are fully implemented for complete fiscal years. It is the intent of the General Assembly that such cost savings realized by the implementation of these three Code sections be redirected into the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program in the following priorities:

      <p>
       "(1) Extension of transitional Medicaid for up to 24 months provided a federal waiver is obtained;

Any offense occurring before January 1, 2014, shall be governed by the statute in effect at the time of such offense and shall be considered a prior adjudication for the purpose of imposing a disposition that provides for a different penalty for subsequent adjudications, of whatever class, pursuant to this Act. The enactment of this Act shall not affect any prosecutions for acts occurring before January 1, 2014, and shall not act as an abatement of any such prosecutions."

      <p>
       Ga. L. 2015, p. 675,
   §
   1-2/SB 8, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a)
   The General Assembly finds that arresting, prosecuting, and incarcerating victimized children serves to retraumatize children and increases their feelings of low self-esteem, making the process of recovery more difficult.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that both federal and state laws recognize that sexually exploited children are the victims of crime and should be treated as victims.
   The General Assembly finds that sexually exploited children deserve the protection of child welfare services, including family support, crisis intervention, counseling, and emergency housing services.
   The General Assembly finds that it is necessary and appropriate to adopt uniform and reasonable assessments and regulations to help address the deleterious secondary effects, including but not limited to, prostitution and sexual exploitation of children, associated with adult entertainment establishments that allow the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol on premises and that provide to their patrons performances and interaction involving various forms of nudity.
   The General Assembly finds that a correlation exists between adult live entertainment establishments and the sexual exploitation of children.
   The General Assembly finds that adult live entertainment establishments present a point of access for children to come into contact with individuals seeking to sexually exploit children.
   The General Assembly further finds that individuals seeking to exploit children utilize adult live entertainment establishments as a means of locating children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that many local governments in this state and in other states found deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments are exacerbated by the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol in such establishments.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b)

     <ol class="alpha">
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1a">
       As used in this Code section, the term "child welfare agency" means any child-caring institution, child-placing agency, children's transition care center, or maternity home.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1b">
       All child welfare agencies shall be licensed or commissioned annually by the department in accordance with procedures, standards, rules, and regulations to be established by the board. The board shall develop and publish in print or electronically rules and regulations for licensing or commissioning of child welfare agencies. Child welfare agencies electing to be commissioned rather than licensed shall operate in accordance with the same procedures, standards, rules, and regulations for licensing of child welfare agencies. A license issued to a child-placing agency shall be deemed approval of all foster family homes approved, supervised, and used by the licensed child-placing agency as a part of its work, subject to this article and rules and regulations of the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1c">
       The department shall assist applicants or licensees or persons holding commissions in meeting rules and regulations of the department for child welfare agencies and, if a licensee or person holding a commission is, for any reason, denied renewal of a license or commission or if a license or commission is revoked or if any applicant for a license or commission cannot meet department rules and regulations for child welfare agencies, the department shall assist in planning the placement of children, if any, in the custody of such child welfare agency in some other licensed or commissioned child welfare agency or assist in returning them to their own homes or in making any other plans or provisions as may be necessary and advisable to meet the particular needs of the children involved.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1d">
       Application for a license or commission shall be made to the department upon forms furnished by the department. Upon receipt of an application for a license or commission and upon presentation by the applicant of evidence that the child welfare agency meets the rules and regulations prescribed by the department, the department shall issue such child welfare agency a license or commission for no more than one year.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1e">
       If the department finds that any child welfare agency applicant does not meet rules and regulations prescribed by the department but is attempting to meet such rules and regulations, the department may, in its discretion, issue a temporary license or commission to such child welfare agency, but such temporary license or commission shall not be issued for more than a one-year period. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that such agency is making progress toward meeting prescribed rules and regulations of the department, the department may, in its discretion, reissue such temporary license or commission for one additional period not to exceed one year. As an alternative to a temporary license or commission, the department, in its discretion, may issue a restricted license or commission which states the restrictions on its face.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1f">
       The department shall refuse a license or commission upon a showing of:
       <ol>
        <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1f1">
         Noncompliance with the rules and regulations for child welfare agencies as adopted by the Board of Human Services which are designated in writing to the facilities as being related to children's health and safety;

       All licensed or commissioned child welfare agencies shall prominently display the license or commission issued to such agency by the department at some point near the entrance of the premises of such agency that is open to view by the public.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1h">
       The department's action revoking or refusing to renew or issue a license or commission required by this Code section shall be preceded by notice and opportunity for a hearing and shall constitute a contested case within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," except that only 30 days' notice in writing from the commissioner's designee shall be required prior to license or commission revocation and except that hearings held relating to such action by the department may be closed to the public if the hearing officer determines that an open hearing would be detrimental to the physical or mental health of any child who will testify at that hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1i">
       Child-caring institutions and child-placing agencies, when licensed in accordance with this Code section, may receive needy or dependent children from their parents, guardians, custodians, or persons serving in loco parentis for special, temporary, or continued care. Parents, guardians, custodians, or persons serving in loco parentis to such children may sign releases or agreements giving to such institutions or agencies custody and control over such children during the period of care. Children's transition care centers may receive medically fragile children from their parents, guardians, custodians, or persons serving in loco parentis for special, temporary, or continued care to facilitate transitions from a hospital or other facility to a home or other appropriate setting.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1j">
       Child-placing agencies, in placing children in foster family homes, shall safeguard the welfare of such children by thoroughly investigating each such home and the character and reputation of the persons residing therein and shall adequately supervise each home during the period of care. All children placed in foster family homes shall, as far as is practicable, be placed with persons of the same religious faith as the children themselves or the children's parents.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1k">
       It shall be the duty of the department to inspect at regular intervals all licensed or commissioned child welfare agencies within the state, including foster family homes used by such child-placing agencies. The department shall have right of entrance, privilege of inspection, and right of access to all children under the care and control of the licensee or commissionee.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1l">
       If any flagrant abuses, derelictions, or deficiencies are made known to the department or its duly authorized agents during their inspection of any child welfare agency or if, at any time, such are reported to the department, the department shall immediately investigate such matters and take such action as conditions may require.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1m">
       If abuses, derelictions, or deficiencies are found in the operation and management of any child welfare agency, they shall be brought immediately to the attention of the management of such agency; and if correctable, but not corrected within a reasonable time, the department shall revoke the license or commission of such agency in the manner prescribed in this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1n">
       The department may require periodic reports from child welfare agencies in such forms and at such times as the department may prescribe.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1o">
       Child welfare agencies and other facilities and institutions wherein children and youths are detained which are operated by any department or agency of state, county, or municipal government shall not be subject to licensure under this Code section, but the department may, through its authorized agents, make periodic inspections of such agencies, facilities, and institutions. Reports of such inspections shall be made privately to the proper authorities in charge of such agencies, facilities, or institutions. The department shall cooperate with such authorities in the development of standards that will adequately protect the health and well-being of all children and youths detained in such agencies, facilities, and institutions or provided care by them. The department may recommend changes in programs and policies and if, within a reasonable time, the standards established by the department and the recommendations of the department are not met, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to make public in the community in which such agency, facility, or institution is located the report of the above-mentioned inspection and the changes recommended by the department. If any serious abuses, derelictions, or deficiencies are found and are not corrected within a reasonable time, the commissioner shall report them in writing to the Governor.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1p">
       Any child welfare agency that shall operate without a license or commission issued by the department shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $500.00 nor more than $1,000.00 for each such offense. Each day of operation without a license or commission shall constitute a separate offense.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1q">
       No person, official, agency, hospital, maternity home, or institution, public or private, in this state shall receive or accept a child under 17 years of age for placement or adoption or place such a child, either temporarily or permanently, in a home other than the home of the child's relatives without having been licensed or commissioned by the department. Notwithstanding the provisions of Code Section 49-5-12.1, violation of this subsection shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $500.00 nor exceeding $1,000.00 for each offense. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit a properly licensed attorney at law from providing necessary legal services and counsel to parties engaged in or contemplating adoption proceedings. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit an individual seeking to:
       <ol>
        <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1q1">

      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1r">
       The department may, without regard to the availability of other remedies, including administrative remedies, seek an injunction against the continued operation of a child welfare agency without a license or commission or the continued operation of a child welfare agency in willful violation of this article or of any regulation of the department or in violation of any order of the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-12ol1s">
       The term "licensed child welfare agency" shall include a commissioned child welfare agency and any references in this Code to a licensed child welfare agency, including criminal, administrative, and civil provisions applicable to licensed child welfare agencies, shall include and apply to commissioned child welfare agencies unless otherwise provided in this article.

       - Trial court erred by failing to provide the defendant with the county child abuse documents the defendant requested during the defendant's trial for child molestation, but the defendant was not denied due process since the defendant failed to show that the trial court withheld any material, exculpatory information.

       - Trial court did not err by failing to release documents showing earlier child abuse from a child's file which might have been critical to a defendant's case since the burden was on the defendant to show what documents in a child's sealed file were suppressed and how it was materially exculpatory and the defendant failed to make the showing.

         Procedure for obtaining records for child abuse investigation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the defendant assigned error to the trial court's failure to direct the Department of Human Resources to disclose any and all reports used by or prepared by the department in investigating an allegation of child abuse, since the records sought by defendant were confidential and access thereto was prohibited except as provided by O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 5, T. 49, the proper procedure for obtaining access was to petition the trial court to subpoena the records and conduct an in camera inspection as to whether the records were necessary for determination of an issue before the court and were otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence. Defendant's general Brady motion was inadequate to have properly raised this issue in the court below, and the assertion of error in this regard was meritless. Davidson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga. App. 557</cite>, <cite class="app_court">359 S.E.2d 372</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga.

       - In a prosecution for aggravated child molestation and related crimes, the trial court did not err in denying the defense request for the notes and work product of the social workers who testified at trial concerning the social workers' contact with the children involved.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Given the fact that the defendant failed to request an in camera inspection of confidential records and files pertaining to allegations of sexual abuse allegedly committed by the defendant until appellate counsel did so in the second amended motion for new trial, the state was not obligated to produce the information and did not violate the defendant's due process rights under Brady or Georgia's reciprocal discovery act by not providing the file earlier. Moreover, some of the information was known to the defendant, and no showing that the information could have been obtained with due diligence was made. Ellis v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 452</cite>, <cite class="app_court">657 S.E.2d 562</cite> (2008).

       Trial court did not err in failing to forward to the defendant the court's confidential file documents regarding two child molestation victims because the trial court's finding that the files contained no exculpatory evidence was alone sufficient, and the defendant made no showing that the material was exculpatory; a defendant who challenges a trial court's in camera inspection on appeal must show what information was suppressed and how that information was materially exculpatory.

      As an alternative to the requirements set out in this article pertaining to obtaining preliminary criminal records check determinations through the department for employees, foster parents, and adults residing in a foster care home, but not including directors of centers, centers may obtain GCIC information through local law enforcement agencies. The center shall be responsible for reviewing the GCIC information obtained for the potential employee, or foster parent or other adult residing in the foster care home, and making a written determination that the individual does not have a criminal record as defined in this article. This written determination, together with all supporting documentation received from any law enforcement agency, must be maintained in the center's file and available for inspection by the department. This satisfactory determination must be made before the employee or foster parent begins any duties for the center. However, where there is an urgent need for an emergency temporary employee to work at a center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing requirements, such center may utilize the applicant as an emergency temporary employee after applying for the preliminary records check through the local law enforcement agency and completing the affidavit. In such emergency situations, the director of the center must complete an affidavit, with all supporting documentation attached thereto, stating that the GCIC information has been requested through an identified local law enforcement agency and that the results were not immediately available to the center prior to assigning the employee to work with children at the center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing ratios. The affidavit with supporting documentation must be maintained in the center's file on the individual and available to the department for inspection. The director shall review the GCIC information upon receipt, but in no case shall an emergency temporary employee be permitted to continue working for more than three days without having a satisfactory determination made by the director and entered into the center's file on the employee with all supporting documentation. The department shall promulgate rules and regulations limiting the extent to which centers are authorized to use emergency temporary employees in accordance with this Code section. Foster parents and adults residing in a foster care home utilized by child-placing agencies shall never be utilized as emergency temporary employees of the child-placing agency. Employees, emergency temporary employees, foster parents, and other adults required to have records checks who are utilized by centers are subject to all other requirements set forth in this article. Where the department has reason to question the validity of the GCIC information or the satisfactory determination made by the center, the department may require the employee, emergency temporary employee, foster parent, or other adult to submit a preliminary criminal records check application through the department together with appropriate fees.

It is expressly provided that upon motion from any party, the hearing officer may, in his discretion, consider matters in mitigation of any conviction, provided the hearing officer examines the circumstances of the case and makes an independent finding that no physical harm was done to a victim and also examines the character and employment history since the conviction and determines that there is no propensity for cruel behavior or behavior involving moral turpitude on the part of the person making a motion for an exception to sanctions normally imposed. If the hearing officer deems a hearing to be appropriate, he will also notify at least 30 days prior to such hearing the office of the prosecuting attorney who initiated the prosecution of the case in question in order to allow the prosecutor to object to a possible determination that the conviction would not be a bar for the grant or continuation of a license or employment as contemplated within this title.

The General Assembly further finds that the work of some of these agencies overlaps, and that the at-risk families and troubled children of Georgia will be more efficiently and effectively served by consolidating the Children and Youth Coordinating Council with the Children's Trust Fund Commission, by placing the functions of the Georgia Child Fatality Review Panel under the supervision of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children, and by encouraging these consolidated agencies to collaborate to create a consistent vision for serving the needs of our state's families in need."

Therefore, the General Assembly is committed to ensuring the provision of appropriate services to children, youth, and families.

Additionally, it is the intent of this part to provide for noninstitutional disposition options in any case before the juvenile court where such disposition is deemed to be in the best interest of the child and of the community.

     <p>
      The policy and intent of the General Assembly in delinquency and other child related problemsand community based services can be summarized as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-150ol11">
       Such programs should be planned and organized at the community level within the state, and such planning efforts should include appropriate representation from local government, local agencies serving families and children, both public and private, local business leaders, citizens with an interest in youth problems, youth representatives, and others as may be appropriate in a particular community.The role of the state should be to provide technical assistance, access to funding, program information, and assistance to local leadership in appropriate planning;
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-150ol12">
       When a child is adjudicated to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or other state agencies, such child should be carefully evaluated through the available community-level resources including a comprehensive team of mental health providers, social services providers, public health and other available medical providers, public schools, and others, as appropriate, prior to the juvenile hearing dealing with disposition so that the disposition of the court may be made with an understanding of the needs of the child and after consideration of the resources available to meet those needs;
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-150ol13">
       It is contrary to the policy of the state for a court to separate a child from his or her own family or commit a child to an institution without a careful evaluation of the needs of the child;
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-150ol14">
       The General Assembly finds that state and local government should be responsive to the need for community based services which would provide an alternative to commitment to an institution.The General Assembly intends that state government should be responsive to this need through the council by helping public and private local groups to plan, develop, and fund community based programs, both residential and nonresidential;
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-5-150ol15">
       It is the intent of the General Assembly that the council develop a funding mechanism that will provide state support for programs that meet the standards developed under the provisions of this part.

        The General Assembly finds that:
        <ol>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1b1">
          Every child in this state is encouraged to have a caring adult who, along with parents and teachers, is able to offer support, friendship, encouragement, and motivation to help the child excel academically and lead a productive life;
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1b2">
          As a society, we look to a child's family to provide a supportive home environment and realize that the primary responsibility for child rearing must remain with the family. However, we are keenly aware of increases in child abuse and neglect, the escalation of drug and alcohol abuse, and that many children who could excel in school are not receiving all the help and support they need to succeed;
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1b3">
          Untapped human resources exist in local communities throughout the state that can provide many children with an additional caring, positive academic role model or mentor. These individuals will help those children progress in school and help direct and reinforce the many opportunities that will further enhance each child's life;
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1b4">
          The members of the private sector throughout this state should be commended for their generous financial support of public schools. Now there is another significant contribution they can and must make to Georgia's children and youth: the investment of human capital in our children's future as academic volunteers and mentors;
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1b5">
          Programs which provide encouragement and support to children through the use of mentors have resulted in significant increases in graduation rates at the secondary level and in much improved enrollment rates in postsecondary education for some of our most vulnerable youth;
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1b6">
          Local, regional, and state-wide resource referral systems must be established to link more efficiently children and potential academic volunteers and mentors with existing programs and organizations; and
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1b7">
          Volunteer and mentor service must be encouraged and appropriately recognized.

       <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1c">
        In order to develop a state-wide strategy to provide academic support and guidance to each student who requires it, there is created the Georgia Mentoring Program, to be administered by the Governor's Office for Children and Families. Subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, the office shall:
        <ol>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1c1">
          Develop a state-wide plan with the goal of matching every child who needs one with an academic mentor. For purposes of this Code section, the term "academic mentor" or "academic volunteer and mentor" means a volunteer who, as a participant in a local project funded under this Code section, supports the needs of the individual child with whom the volunteer is matched, including without limitation, strengthening the child's academic preparation and achievement;
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1c2">

         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1c3">
          Develop criteria and procedures for funding local projects for the provision of academic volunteer and mentor services, based on local need. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to, the following indicators: size of the school age population, school dropout rates, and student achievement;
         </li>
         <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1c4">
          Develop and implement a state-wide public awareness and recruitment campaign for academic mentors; and

        The Governor's Office for Children and Families shall award grants to local school systems to administer the academic volunteer and mentor service program within the local school district, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly. Funds awarded under this Code section shall be expended exclusively for the recruitment, screening, training, and placement of academic mentors in accordance with the purposes of this Code section and for evaluation of the program established by this Code section. Local school systems which receive grants shall contract with nonprofit organizations or local government agencies for program operations. In selecting the organization or agency with which to contract, the local school system shall consider the experience of the organization or agency with operating volunteer mentor projects. Each entity receiving funds under this Code section shall consult and cooperate with any teacher in whose classroom it is proposed that an academic mentor be placed. No displacement of any certified or classified school employee shall occur as a result of the use of any academic mentor pursuant to this Code section.

       <li id="t49c05s49-5-156ol1f">
        The General Assembly further finds that outstanding academic volunteer and mentor service should be encouraged and recognized. For that purpose, the Governor is authorized to provide an award to recognize outstanding academic volunteer or mentor service in the schools for each fiscal year in which funds are appropriated for the program established under this Code section. Local school systems may nominate an individual or individual program that has had a significant and positive impact upon the lives of children for the award.

        No later than one year following the date on which funding is provided for the purposes of this Code section, and annually thereafter in any fiscal year for which funds are appropriated for the purposes of this Code section, the Governor's Office for Children and Families shall submit to the General Assembly a report describing the progress and accomplishments of the Georgia Mentoring Program. The report shall also identify any barriers to the full achievement of the goals of the program and shall include any recommended legislative changes in that regard.

      effective January 1, 2020, rewrote this Code section, which read: "(a) Upon receipt of an investigator's report of a substantiated case pursuant to Code Section 49-5-182 naming an alleged child abuser, the division:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Shall include in the child abuse registry the name of the alleged child abuser, the classification of the abuse as provided in paragraph (4) of Code Section 49-5-182, and a copy of the investigator's report; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Shall mail to such alleged child abuser in such report a notice regarding the substantiated case via certified mail, return receipt requested. It shall be a rebuttable presumption that any such notice has been received if the return receipt has been received by the division. The notice shall further inform such alleged child abuser of his or her right to a hearing to appeal such determination. The notice shall further inform such alleged child abuser of the procedures for obtaining the hearing and that an opportunity shall be afforded all parties to be represented by legal counsel and to respond and present evidence on all issues involved.

In the event the administrative law judge conducting the hearing determines that any such alleged minor child abuser will not be so represented at the hearing, or that the interests of any such alleged minor child abuser may conflict with the interests of the alleged minor child abuser's parent or other legal guardian, the administrative law judge shall order the division to apply to the superior court of the county in which the alleged act of child abuse was committed to have counsel appointed for the alleged minor child abuser. Payment for any such court appointed representation shall be made by such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) In order to exercise such right to a hearing, the alleged child abuser shall file a written request for a hearing with the division within ten days after receipt of such notice. The written request shall contain the alleged child abuser's current residence address and, if he or she has a telephone, a telephone number at which he or she may be notified of the hearing.

      "(e) At the conclusion of the hearing under subsection (d) of this Code section, upon a finding that there is not a preponderance of evidence to conclude that the alleged child abuser committed an act of child abuse, the administrative law judge shall order that the alleged child abuser's name be removed from the child abuse registry. The general public shall be excluded from hearings of the Office of State Administrative Hearings held pursuant to this article, and the files and records relating thereto shall be confidential and not subject to public inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the decision of the administrative law judge under subsection (e) of this Code section shall constitute the final administrative decision. Any party shall have the right of judicial review of such decision in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act,' except that the petition for review shall be filed within ten days after such decision and may only be filed with and the decision appealed to the superior court of the county where the hearing took place or, if the hearing was conducted by telephone, the Superior Court of Fulton County.

       - Trial court erred by addressing the constitutionality of the Child Abuse Registry statutes and rules because every component of the plaintiffs' case should have been dismissed since, although it was understandable why the plaintiffs were so upset about the way in which the plaintiffs' names came to be put on the registry, the plaintiffs had already commenced the administrative process available to challenge the plaintiffs' listings, which the plaintiffs were required to follow through with and complete.

The General Assembly further finds that federal funding made available to the states under Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act may be used to administer programs to provide such coverage. The General Assembly further finds the provision of adequate medical coverage for this population to be in the public interest and further declares the establishment of the program pursuant to this article to be a desirable and economical means of increasing access to such medical coverage.

       There is created the PeachCare for Kids Program to provide health care benefits for children in families with income below 235 percent of the federal poverty level. Children from birth through 18 years of age in families with family incomes below 235 percent of the federal poverty level and who are not eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid shall be eligible for the program, to be administered by the department pursuant to federal law and subject to availability of funding.

       No entitlement to benefits for the children covered under the program or this article shall be created by the program, nor shall this article or any rules or regulations adopted pursuant to this article be interpreted to entitle any person to receive any health services or insurance available under this program.

The department shall operate the program consistent with administrative efficiency and the best interests of children.

However, the program shall exclude nonemergency transportation and targeted case management services. The department shall utilize appropriate medical management and utilization control procedures necessary to manage care effectively and shall prospectively limit enrollment in the program and modify the health care services benefits when the department has reason to believe the cost of such enrollment or services may exceed the availability of funding.

       The General Assembly finds that foster parents providing care for children who are in the custody of the Department of Human Services play an integral, indispensable, and vital role in the state's effort to care for dependent children displaced from their homes.

        - Once state officials have removed a child from his or her home, the officials have a constitutional duty to protect the child from harm.
   This duty includes an obligation to fund and implement safe and appropriate placements and services that do not substantially depart from accepted standards of professional judgment and do not unnecessarily interfere with the child's rights of familial association. Kenny A. v. Perdue,

       - Trial court abused the court's discretion by denying a foster parent's petition to adopt the foster child on the ground that placing the child with the foster parent, who was not married to the individual with whom the foster parent lived, violated the state's public policy because all of the evidence showed that the adoption would be in the child's best interest, and the trial court failed to apply the law as written and determine whether it was in the child's best interest to allow the adoption; all of the witnesses, including the guardian ad litem the trial court appointed to represent the child's interests and the Department of Family and Children's Services adoption specialist, testified that the adoption was in the child's best interest and that to remove the child from the only family the child had ever known would be devastating to the child, and O.C.G.A.

       The constantly increasing proportion of older people within the population of this state and the increasing gravity of the human distress and the loss accruing to the entire society as a result of the limitations and disadvantages confronting older people in maintaining their economic self-sufficiency and personal well-being and realizing their maximum potential as contributors to their community, state, and nation are matters of profound import and concern for all the people of this state.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c06s49-6-1ol1b">
       It is, therefore, necessary and of the utmost importance to encourage the development and maintenance within this state of a comprehensive and coordinated network of public and private facilities for the alleviation or correction of these limitations and disadvantages and to encourage the conducting of continuous study and research into the needs and problems of older people under present and future economic and social conditions because it is essential for the prevention of dependency and the conservation of human values and a necessity in safeguarding and fostering the general welfare.

      <li id="t49c06s49-6-1ol1c">
       It is, therefore, declared to be the intent of the General Assembly by the passage of this article to provide for encouragement of the development, maintenance, and coordination of the aforementioned facilities.

      <p>
       The purpose of this article is to assist functionally impaired elderly persons in living dignified and reasonably independent lives in their own homes or in the homes of relatives or caregivers through the development, expansion, reorganization, and coordination of various community based services. In recognition of the desire of older Georgians to reside at home or with their families as long as possible, the General Assembly intends that a continuum of care be established so that functionally impaired elderly persons age 60 and older may be assured the least restrictive environment suitable to their needs. The General Assembly further intends to maximize the utilization of existing community social and health services in order to prevent unnecessary placement of individuals in long-term care facilities. The development of innovative approaches to program management, staff training, and service delivery that impact on cost avoidance, cost effectiveness, and program efficiency shall be encouraged. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of Community Health shall serve as the agency responsible for planning and implementing the provision of community based services to the elderly reimbursable under the "Georgia Medical Assistance Act of 1977."

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

      The General Assembly having declared that Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is a looming state and national public health crisis and having found that it is in the best interest of the state and its citizenry to address this issue created a Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan for the purpose of developing a strategy to mobilize a state response. The provisions of this chapter are enacted to further the intention of the State of Georgia to become a more dementia-friendly and dementia-capable environment for the citizens of Georgia with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. To further that purpose, the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan Advisory Council is created to ensure that focus remains on implementing and amending as needed the goals set forth in the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan.
