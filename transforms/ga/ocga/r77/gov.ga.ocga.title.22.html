       The right of eminent domain is the right of this state, through its regular organization, to reassert, either temporarily or permanently, its dominion over any portion of the soil of this state on account of public exigency and for the public good. Thus, in time of war or insurrection the proper authorities may possess and hold any part of the territory of this state for the common safety. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, except as provided in Code Section 22-1-15, neither this state nor any political subdivision thereof nor any other condemning authority shall use eminent domain unless it is for public use. Public use is a matter of law to be determined by the court and the condemnor bears the burden of proof.

         Except as provided in Code Section 22-1-15, if property acquired through the power of eminent domain from an owner fails to be put to a public use within five years, the former property owner may apply to the condemnor or its successor or assign for reconveyance or quitclaim of the property to the former property owner or for additional compensation for such property. For purposes of this subsection, property shall be considered to have been put to a public use at the point in time when substantial good faith effort has been expended on a project to put the property to public use, notwithstanding the fact that the project may not have been completed. The application shall be in writing, and the condemnor or its successor or assign shall act on the application within 60 days by:
         <ol type="A">
          <li id="t22c01s22-1-2ol1c1A">
           Executing a reconveyance or quitclaim of the property upon receipt of compensation not to exceed the amount of the compensation paid by the condemnor at the time of acquisition; or

           Paying additional compensation to the former owner of the property, such compensation to be calculated by subtracting the price paid by the condemnor for the property at the time of acquisition from the fair market value of the property at the time the application is filed.

         If the condemnor fails to take either action within 60 days, the former property owner may, within the next 90 days following, initiate an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located to reacquire the property or receive additional compensation.

       When property is acquired from more than one owner for the same public use and reconveyance or additional compensation to a single owner is impracticable, any party to the original condemnation or each person with a legal claim in such condemnation may file an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located for an equitable resolution.

       - Since the power to take private property for a public use or benefit is in derogation of the right of the citizen, statutes under which it is claimed must be strictly construed, and it is generally held that the power is not conferred unless an intention to that effect appears in clear and express terms, or by necessary implication.

       - After the Department of Transportation informed a corporation in the spring of 1981 that a building leased by the corporation would be condemned for highway purposes, but later all work on the proposed highway, including all condemnation actions in progress, was halted, and the corporation sought to recover from the department the corporation's loss of an advantageous leasehold interest, as well as expenses involved in moving, since the corporation had been advised that no move was required before September 1982, and that written notification would precede a required removal, the corporation's
   decision to move in August 1982 was by voluntary choice, and could not be attributed to an interference by the department with the corporation's exclusive rights of ownership, use and enjoyment. Hence, whether the corporation's action was characterized as direct or inverse condemnation, the losses claimed did not result from an exercise of eminent domain. Josh Cabaret, Inc. v. DOT, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 749</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 346</cite> (1987).

       - The necessity or expediency of appropriating particular property for public use is not a matter of judicial cognizance, but one for the determination of the legislative branch of the government, and this must obviously be so when the state takes for the state's own purposes.

       - The taking or injuring of private property for the public benefit is the exercise of a high power, and all the conditions and limitations provided by law, under which it may be done, should be closely followed. Too much caution in this respect cannot be observed to prevent abuse and oppression. Thomas v.

       - When private property is condemned for public use the owner is entitled to receive just and adequate compensation as of the date of the taking and not as of the date of the announcement of the taking, and the value of the property should be fixed at the time of its taking.

       - In eminent domain proceedings, the property owner must be paid just and adequate compensation before the owner's property is taken. Thomas v. City of Cairo, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 336</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 192</cite> (1950).

       - A taking of property for which compensation must be first paid does not require an actual physical taking, but may consist in an interference with the rights of ownership, use and enjoyment, or any other right incident to property. Woodside v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 75</cite>, <cite class="app_court">103 S.E.2d 108</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a condemnation case, an arbitrator properly found that the condemnor who refused to assist the owner of the condemned land in relocating its plant located on the condemned land, was responsible for the owner's failure to relocate the plant. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the cost of relocating a plant located on the condemned land exceeded the plant's value, as awarded by an arbitrator, the plant's owner could not be charged with failing to mitigate its damages by not relocating. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).

        Market value is not the only criterion for determining just and adequate compensation
       
       when property is taken or damaged for public purposes. State Hwy. Dep't v. Augusta Dist. of N. Ga. Conference of Methodist Church, <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 162</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 29</cite> (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:
       
       replacement cost new less depreciation, income, and comparable sales. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Loss of future revenue is not a proper measure of damages
       
       in condemnation procedures, but the value of property to the owner for the particular purpose for which the owner designs to use the property can always be shown. Harrison v. Regents of Univ. Sys., <cite class="ga_app_court">105 Ga. App. 817</cite>, <cite class="app_court">125 S.E.2d 793</cite> (1962).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" when fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when the properties are not of a type generally bought or sold in the open market. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).

       - "Unique" property is measured by a variety of nonfair market methods of valuation, including the cost and income methods. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).

        It is not incorrect to instruct jury on lost profits
       
       as a means of awarding just and adequate compensation because the income approach necessarily takes into account what future earnings would be were the property interest not extinguished.

       - Business losses are recoverable as a separate item only if the property is "unique." DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a business belongs to the landowner, total destruction of the business at the location must be proven before business losses may be recovered as a separate element of compensation. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the business belongs to a separate lessee, the lessee may recover for business losses as an element of compensation separate from the value of the land whether the destruction of the business is total or merely partial, provided only that the loss is not remote or speculative. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a condemnation case, the fact that the owner of the condemned land had ceased the operation of a rendering plant located on the land by the time of trial did not preclude the recovery of business loss damages. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).

       <p>
        <p>
       Award of business loss damages was proper for the condemnation of land on which a rendering plant was located because the loss was not speculative: the plant was established and plants engaged in the rendering business were not generally bought and sold on the open market, making it unique. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).

       - After the Department of Transportation informed a corporation in the spring of 1981 that a building leased by the corporation would be condemned for highway purposes, but later all work on the proposed highway, including all condemnation actions in progress, was halted, and the corporation sought to recover from the department the corporation's loss of an advantageous leasehold interest, as well as expenses involved in moving, since the corporation had been advised that no move was required before September 1982, and that written notification would precede a required removal, the corporation's decision to move in August 1982, was by voluntary choice, and could not be attributed to an interference by the department with the corporation's exclusive rights of ownership, use and enjoyment. Hence, whether the corporation's action was characterized as direct or inverse condemnation, the losses claimed did not result from an exercise of eminent domain. Josh Cabaret, Inc. v. DOT, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 749</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 346</cite> (1987).

       - On a question in regard to the value of land sought to be condemned, it is competent to introduce evidence of sales of property similar to that in question, made at or near the time of the taking. The exact limit either of similarity or difference or of nearness or remoteness in point of time is difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe by any arbitrary rule, but must to a large extent depend on the location and the character of the property and the circumstances of the case; it is to be considered with reference to throwing light on the issue, and not as a mere method of raising a legal puzzle.

       Trial court did not err in denying the property owners' motion to dismiss the condemnation petition, nor in overruling the owners' exception to the special master's award, because the evidence at the special master hearing showed that the telecommunications condemnor made an effort to agree on a purchase price for the property, but that those negotiations ultimately failed, which was sufficient to show that the condemnor could not procure the property by contract within the meaning of O.C.G.A.

       - The taking or injuring of private property for the public benefit is the exercise of a high power, and all the conditions and limitations provided by law, under which it may be done, should be closely followed.

     <p>
      In order to encourage and expedite the acquisition of real property by agreements with owners, to avoid litigation and relieve congestion in the courts, to assure consistent treatment for property owners, and to promote public confidence in land acquisition practices, all condemnations and potential condemnations shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be guided by the following policies and practices:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol11">
       The condemning authority shall make every reasonable effort to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol12">
       Where the condemning authority seeks to obtain a fee simple interest in real property, real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his or her designated representatives shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his or her inspection of the property, except that the condemning authority may, by law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, prescribe a procedure to waive the appraisal in cases involving the acquisition by sale or donation of property with a low fair market value;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol13">
       Before the initiation of negotiations for fee simple interest for real property, the condemning authority shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. In no event shall such amount be less than the condemning authority's independent appraisal of the fair market value of such property. The condemning authority shall provide the owner of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount it established as just compensation. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated. The condemning authority shall consider alternative sites suggested by the owner of the property as part of the compensation offered;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol14">
       No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the condemning authority pays the agreed purchase price or deposits with the court in accordance with this title, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the condemning authority's appraisal of the fair market value of such property or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for such property;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol15">
       The construction or development of a project for public use shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling or to move his or her business or farm operation without at least 90 days' written notice from the condemning authority of the date by which such move is required;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol16">

      Only public necessity can justify taking of private property.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - The right of the humblest individual in the enjoyment of the individual's property must be protected. The right to take private property from the owner for public use often works extreme hardship and savors of oppression. Nothing but a public necessity can justify it, and then only in strict conformity with the law. Williams v. City of La Grange, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 241</cite>, <cite class="app_court">98 S.E.2d 617</cite> (1957).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Condemnor chooses its method of procedure,
    
    and it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. The property owner is also bound, although he did not choose the method of procedure. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).

     Amendment of notice of condemnation proceedings is perfectly proper
    
    when the amendment's allowance does not adversely and substantially affect the condemnee's rights. Taylor v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">129 Ga. App. 89</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E.2d 701</cite> (1973).

     <p>
    - The burden of proof to show the value of the land taken and the consequential damages to the remaining property, if any, is on the condemnor. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 590</cite> (1965).

      Sole question for assessors or jury is amount of compensation.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - When proceedings are instituted for the purpose of acquiring property for public purposes, the sole question which may be passed upon by the appointed assessors, or by a jury on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid to one whose property is being taken by the condemning authorities. Since the legislature has not expressly provided any method whereby the property owner can contest the question of public necessity or the right of condemnation, the property owner is left without a legal remedy and must resort to an independent action in a court of equity for relief. Williams v. City of La Grange, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 241</cite>, <cite class="app_court">98 S.E.2d 617</cite> (1957); B. &amp; W. Hen Farm, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 830</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E.2d 841</cite> (1966).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    The sole power of the assessors relates to the value of the property taken and to no other question. City of Carrollton v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 505</cite>, <cite class="app_court">111 S.E.2d 79</cite> (1959).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    In condemnation cases, the sole question for the consideration of the jury, upon an appeal from an award of the assessors or from an award of a special master, is the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee for the property taken under the condemnation proceeding and the amount of damages to the remaining property of the condemnee, if any. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 590</cite> (1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Appeal from award of assessors is de novo investigation,
    
    and the defendant in such proceedings may file an appropriate legal defense thereto. City of Macon v. Ries, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 320</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E. 21</cite> (1934).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    An appeal from the award of assessors in a condemnation proceeding is a de novo investigation, and the defendant may file appropriate pleadings and defenses therein as in other suits. Georgia Power Co. v. Lightfoot, <cite class="ga_app_court">97 Ga. App. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">103 S.E.2d 99</cite> (1958).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Law does not provide for intervention by any person claiming interest in property,
    
    whether or not such person was served with notice. Mitchell v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 88</cite> (1961).

      Statutory construction when procedural provisions incomplete.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - When wording is taken from a prior statute, or when the law fails to be complete within itself, then reference to provisions for proceedings before assessors is permitted to fill in the void. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).

      Contesting validity of condemnation proceedings.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - When a property owner participates in proceedings but refuses to take the award of the assessors, and when the property owner acted promptly after the award of the assessors was made by filing the owner's petition in equity, alleging that the condemnor was proceeding illegally and had no right to condemn, and sought to enjoin the entering upon or taking possession of the owner's property, the property owner is not estopped from contesting the validity of the condemnation proceedings. Johnston v. Clayton County Water Auth., <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 39</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1966).

     Department of Transportation may not condemn municipally owned property
    
    as the legislature has not clearly granted such authority or created a procedure therefore, and as such grant may not be implied from statutory provisions generally establishing a procedure for state agencies to condemn "private property." DOT v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">255 Ga. 124</cite>, <cite class="app_court">337 S.E.2d 327</cite> (1985).

     Condemnation procedures are constitutional,

         Owner entitled to compensation for land taken and for damage to remaining land.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When a county, in the exercise of the county's corporate powers, appropriates land of an individual, and as a result the premises of the owner are rendered less valuable, the individual is entitled to just compensation for the land so taken, and also for the injury thus sustained. Terrell County v. York, <cite class="ga_court">127 Ga. 166</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E. 309</cite> (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In condemnation proceedings, the condemnor is liable not only for direct damages for the actual land taken for the public use, but in addition thereto for all consequential damages which naturally and proximately flow from the taking of the land to the remainder of the parcel or tract of land not taken as tend to diminish the property's market value. Georgia Power Co. v. McCrea, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 542</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There are only two elements of damages to be considered in a condemnation proceeding: first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of the property to the purposes for which the property is condemned. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Law allows damages to property not actually appropriated
       
       in an eminent domain proceeding as consequential damages if such damages are shown. Justice v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_app_court">100 Ga. App. 794</cite>, <cite class="app_court">112 S.E.2d 307</cite> (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Remote and speculative or possible damages are not allowed.
       
       McCrea v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 276</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 540</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Remote or merely speculative or possible damages are not allowed in considering the value of the land taken nor consequential damage to the land not taken. Southern Ry. v. Miller, <cite class="ga_app_court">94 Ga. App. 701</cite>, <cite class="app_court">96 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The uses which may be considered in determining damages must be so reasonably probable as to have an effect on the present market value of the land; a purely imaginative or speculative value cannot be considered. State Hwy. Dep't v. Howard, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 298</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E.2d 177</cite> (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Anything that actually enhances value of land must be considered
       
       in order to meet the constitutional demand that the owner be paid, before the taking, adequate and just compensation. DOT v. Arnold, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 502</cite>, <cite class="app_court">268 S.E.2d 775</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Assessment of compensation covers all damages which result from proper construction,
       
       whether those damages were foreseen or not. Whipple v. County of Houston, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 532</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It cannot be assumed in condemnation proceedings that there will be negligent construction
       
       or operation of the project so as to cause damage in excess of that which would naturally and proximately result from the construction and operation thereof. McCrea v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 276</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 540</cite> (1933).

       - The mere contiguity of several parcels of land belonging to one owner does not in itself render the lots in the aggregate an entire tract. Gaines v. City of Calhoun, <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 89</cite>, <cite class="app_court">155 S.E. 214</cite> (1930).

       - The mere platting of a tract of land and its subdivision into vacant building lots does not necessarily destroy the oneness or unity of the entire property. Gaines v. City of Calhoun, <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 89</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E. 214</cite> (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Burden of proof is upon the condemnor,
       
       when the property has been taken or damaged, to establish by a preponderance of the evidence what amount of money constitutes just and adequate compensation. State Hwy. Bd. v. Shierling, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 935</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 885</cite> (1935).

        Only issue before assessors or jury on appeal is amount of compensation to be paid,

       - When property is taken under power of eminent domain for a public use, the property's market value for all purposes for which the property is available is the true measure of the owner's compensation, the value of the property to the condemnor for the specific purpose for which the property is taken is not the basis for measuring the amount of compensation payable to the owner.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Market value of property is what the property will bring when sold for cash by a person ready and willing to sell, but under no obligation to sell, and when bought by a person ready and willing to buy, but under no obligation to buy. Housing Auth. v. Spink, <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 72</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 80</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:
       
       replacement cost new less depreciation, income, and comparable sales. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Lost profits may be used as means of awarding just and adequate compensation
       
       because the income approach necessarily takes into account what future earnings would be were the property interest not extinguished. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Improvements on land are proper subjects for independent valuation
       
       in consideration of the just and adequate compensation for the total property taken. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).

        Condemnee can recover compensation for loss of use of property during period of construction
       
       by the county, based on the property's rental value during that time, if the jury first finds that a loss of use had occurred and that the condemnee had taken reasonable steps to avoid such loss.

        Ascertaining value of land taken by subtracting value of land remaining from value of whole land before taking is error,

       - Trial court did not err in denying motion to strike the testimony of condemnee's expert witness that the condemned property's highest and best use would be as a convenience store because of the property's location in relation to nearby industry and residential development since the testimony was based on relevant facts concerning existing local population and industry.

        <p>
       - Although charge restricting jury, in determining value of property, to uses which may be lawfully made of the property at time of taking as set out in zoning ordinances then in effect was incorrect, there was no harm since the condemned property was zoned for industrial use at the time of taking and the appellant contended that the property's highest and best use was industrial.

       Instruction that the mere possibility that land might be used for a certain purpose is not enough to authorize a jury to consider the effect of such a possibility in determining the value of land.

       The test for estimating the value of land under this section is whether the land sought to be condemned could be used for other purposes, and not whether the land would be used for other purposes.

       <p>
        <p>
       The test is whether the land is legitimately usable for other purposes, not whether such use is certain. Possible future uses will not influence the present market value of a tract unless there is a demand for such uses or those uses are otherwise reasonably probable. Georgia Power Co. v.

        <p>
       - Unique property is simply property which must be valued by something other than the fair market value standard because there is no general market for such property. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1983).

        <p>

        Unique value is pecuniary value of certain property to the property's present owner,
       
       in a situation when the owner can find no other property equally well suited to the owner's use, and there is no taker on the open market at the pecuniary value of the property to the owner. In such a case there is no market value, which presupposes a willing-buyer willing-seller situation. Housing Auth. v. Troncalli, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 515</cite>, <cite class="app_court">142 S.E.2d 93</cite> (1965).

       <p>
        <p>
       Since valuing property at the property's fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" such that fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when the properties are not of a type generally bought or sold in the open market.

       - Neither "privacy," which is inherent in ownership of all property, nor the fact that the condemned land was "riverfront" property, would authorize a charge on the condemned property having a value "peculiar" to the owner, or that the realty was "unique."

        <p>
       - The measure of the condemnee's recovery is the fair market value of the property taken, and a condemnee can only recover for the value that the property has to the condemnee over and above fair market value in such cases when the evidence shows that the property had some unique and special economic, not merely sentimental, value to the condemnee alone.

       On a question of the value of land sought to be condemned, it is competent to introduce evidence of sales of property similar to that in question, made at or near the time of the taking. The exact limit either of similarity or difference, or of nearness or remoteness in point of time is difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe by any arbitrary rule, but must to a large extent depend on the location and the character of the property and the circumstances of the case.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The introduction of evidence of particular sales is permitted after such evidence has been qualified by evidence of the similarity of the comparable property with the property being condemned or taken. After the introduction of such preliminary evidence of similarity, the trial judge must determine whether the comparable property is sufficiently similar or nearly like the property being condemned, and whether the time and manner of the particular sale are truly illustrative of the value of the property being condemned. Fulton County v. Cox, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 840</cite> (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Generally, evidence of sales of property similar to that in question made at or near the time of the taking is competent evidence and may be considered to throw light on the issue of the value of the property sought to be condemned; however, the determination as to whether or not the witness testified as to comparable properties similar to that in question is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Oglethorpe Power Corp. v. Seasholtz, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 723</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 429</cite> (1981).

        Comparability of sales upon which expert value witness bases opinion goes to weight of testimony,

        Although unaccepted offers to purchase do not constitute evidence of market value, offers are admissible

       - Oral and not binding offers are so easily made and refused in a mere passing conversation, and under circumstances involving no responsibility on either side, as to cast no light upon the question of value. Southern Ry. v. Miller, <cite class="ga_app_court">94 Ga. App. 701</cite>, <cite class="app_court">96 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1956).

        <p>
       When an offer to purchase excludes on its face the property to be taken and thus constitutes merely an offer to purchase the remainder, and another offer, while it includes the property to be taken, appears to be nothing more than a mere oral expression of willingness to purchase, unaccompanied by any proposed terms, any indication of ability to perform, or anything else which might indicate that it was a serious and bona fide offer, such "offers" are too susceptible of fabrication to be allowed into evidence even as a partial basis of opinion testimony.

       Measure of damages for injury to adjoining property

      The measure of the consequential damages to adjoining property as a result of the condemnation of land for public purposes is the diminution of the value of the adjoining property measured by the difference between the fair market value of the property immediately before the condemnation and immediately after the condemnation. State Hwy. Bd. v. Coleman, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga. App. 54</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 262</cite> (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The question of consequential damages involves the consideration of the value of the remaining land before the taking and the land's value after the taking and a determination of whether or not there was a difference in the value before and after the taking. Sumner v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 493</cite> (1964); Simon v.

       - When a limited access highway is condemned by the state, which highway cuts off several acres from the remainder of the land of the condemnee leaving those several acres without any access thereto, testimony offered by the condemnor that with access there would be no damage to the isolated land, standing alone, is inadmissible and without probative value on the question of consequential damages to those several acres without access.

         Measure of damages for property taken is pecuniary loss to owner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - The measure of damages for property taken by the right of eminent domain, being compensatory in its nature, is the pecuniary loss sustained by the owner, taking into consideration all relevant factors; ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.

         Damages ordinarily measured by market value.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Ordinarily, when an entire parcel of property is taken, or an entire leasehold interest is taken, the measure of the damages is the "market value" of the land or leasehold interest as the case might be; market value has been defined as the price which may be paid by one wishing but not required to buy, to one wishing but not required to sell. 1958-59 Op.

         Assessment of consequential damages.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - In assessing consequential damages, the difference would lie in the valuation of the land which remains after condemnation, as compared with the value of that fragment of land before the condemnation was commenced; in considering this "damage," the assessors or jury would be bound to deduct from the whole damage, any increase which might result from the improvement respecting the sales value or market value of the tract not taken. 1958-59 Op.

         Payment of taxes on land taken by eminent domain.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - The payment of city or county taxes is not a proper element of damages in a condemnation case; the payment of property taxes is a responsibility of the landowner only so long as the landowner, in fact, owns the property. The property owner or condemnee would be responsible for payment of taxes up to the date of taking; after that time, the responsibility for the payment of these taxes would lie upon the condemning body, if in fact that body is an entity which would have the responsibility for payment of these taxes. 1969 Op.

       <p>
        - The cost of moving personal property from real estate which is taken for public purposes cannot be considered as an element of damage, as such; however, the cost of removal of either fixtures, buildings, or personalty, especially when used for business purposes, may be considered as one of the factors entering into a determination of the value of the real estate to the condemnee from whom the property is taken. 1958-59 Op.

        - The cost of moving personal property may in many instances, be evidential as to, or illustrative of, the damage done to such personal property by the taking; such damage must be paid by the authority which so takes it for public purposes. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 276.

        i.e., a portion of the building lies on land which is taken, and a portion of the building lies on land which is not taken, that portion of the building which extends upon the right of way may be severed if it is practicable to do so without destruction of the building; if severance would result in destruction, then the measure of damage to the building is its full value. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.
       </p>
       <p>
        In circumstances when a condemnation causes the intersection of a building by the line drawn between the land taken and the land not taken, if it is impossible to sever the building and the whole building would be destroyed, the value of the land without the building taken would be charged against the condemnor; the true market value of the remaining portion of the condemnee's land without the building, of course, it being destroyed, would be compared with the value of that tract before taking. 1958-59 Op.

       - The word "damaged," has a broader meaning than the word "taken," and is designed to impose liability on a condemnor for consequential injuries to property which would not otherwise exist. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1983).

       <p>
        <p>
       - In condemnation proceedings, the condemnor is liable not only for direct damages for the actual land taken for the public use, but in addition thereto for all consequential damages which naturally and proximately flow from the taking of the land to the remainder of the parcel or tract of land not taken as tend to diminish its market value. Georgia Power Co. v. McCrea, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 542</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There are two elements to be considered in connection with the damages in condemnation cases, the actual value of the land taken and the consequential damage or consequential benefit to the remaining land. Fulton County v. Power, <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 783</cite>, <cite class="app_court">137 S.E.2d 474</cite> (1964).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In an eminent domain proceeding, the "just and adequate compensation" due a condemnee is "the value" of the land taken, plus any consequential damages to the remainder if there is a partial taking, which may not be less than "the actual value" of the property taken or damaged. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1983).

        Law allows damages to property not actually appropriated

       - In any eminent domain case, the evidence and instructions to the jury should be such that the jurors are enabled to figure separately the value of the land or interest therein which is taken and the consequential damages to the land not taken, the latter of course balanced against any consequential benefits and by adding the two figures return a lump sum verdict which includes both items of depreciated value to the landowner. Georgia Power Co. v. Sinclair, <cite class="ga_app_court">122 Ga. App. 305</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E.2d 639</cite> (1970).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The question of the value of the land taken and condemned and the amount of consequential damages to be assessed against the condemnor for the remaining land are matters of opinion. Derrick v. Rabun County, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 583</cite> (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Measure of damages for property taken is pecuniary loss sustained by owner,
       
       taking into consideration all relevant factors. Ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be the fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. Housing Auth. v. Savannah Iron &amp; Wire Works, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 881</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E.2d 671</cite> (1955).
       </p>

        Assessment of compensation covers all damages which result from proper construction,
       
       whether those damages are foreseen or not. Whipple v. County of Houston, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 532</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1958).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the public authorities properly erected and properly maintain the improvements authorized by law, the only right of action which is maintainable is that conferred by state constitutional provision; it does not sound in tort, and the recovery permitted is strictly limited to the direct damage inflicted by diminishing the market value of the property damaged, as measured by the difference in its market value before and immediately after the construction of the public works, excluding all consequential damages subsequently accruing, such as might be recoverable in an action sounding in tort, based on the maintenance of a continuing, abatable nuisance. Felton v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 930</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 506</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It cannot be assumed in condemnation proceedings that there will be negligent construction
       
       or operation of the project so as to cause damage in excess of that which would naturally and proximately result from the construction and operation thereof. McCrea v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 276</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 540</cite> (1933).

       - The mere contiguity of several parcels of land belonging to one owner does not in itself render the lots in the aggregate an entire tract. Gaines v. City of Calhoun, <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 89</cite>, <cite class="app_court">155 S.E. 214</cite> (1930).

       <p>
        <p>
       - It is not necessary to the validity of an assessment in a condemnation proceeding that all three of the assessors agree upon a valuation. A majority is sufficient. Cable v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 593</cite>, <cite class="app_court">68 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1952).
       </p>

        <p>

        Assessment made by two assessors in absence of third cannot be collaterally attacked
       
       in a suit for injunction. If the assessment is irregular or erroneous, it must be vacated and set aside in a direct attack upon the award. Cable v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 593</cite>, <cite class="app_court">68 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1952).

        In a proceeding to condemn only a portion of a tract of land
       
       the only question to be determined by the jury is the amount which the condemnor should pay as just and adequate compensation for the part taken and consequential damages, if any, to the remaining portion of the tract, as such damages may be offset, but not exceeded, by consequential benefits. Alabama Power Co. v. Chandler, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 550</cite>, <cite class="app_court">123 S.E.2d 767</cite> (1962).

       - When a street upon which a lot abuts is closed by an obstruction at an intersecting street, which, as respects the lot, makes the street upon which it abuts a cul-de-sac, although the obstruction is neither immediately in front of the lot nor touches the lot, and the obstruction thereby materially diminishes and curtails the right of the owner to the free and uninterrupted use of the street in front of the lot, as a means of access to and from different parts of the city, it constitutes a special damage to the lot, different in kind from that inflicted upon the community in general, and the owner has a right of action in damages therefor. Felton v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 930</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 506</cite> (1935).

       - When land is condemned for use as a new limited access highway the condemnee is not entitled to damages, actual or consequential, for lack of access to that new highway by reason of any rights of easement for ingress and egress to and from that highway.

        "Value," as used in reference to land taken under eminent domain,
       
       is a relative term depending on the circumstances. Thus, under some circumstances, "the value" might be the actual value, the market value, the salable value, the reasonable value, and the cash value. State Hwy. Bd. v. Bridges, <cite class="ga_app_court">60 Ga. App. 240</cite>, <cite class="app_court">3 S.E.2d 907</cite> (1939).

       It was not reversible error to charge the jury that "value," which is qualified in this section as "actual value," is the fair and reasonable value of a strip of land actually taken.

        When a condemnation causes the intersection of a building by the line drawn between the land taken and the land not taken, when it is impossible to sever the building and the whole building would be destroyed, the value of the land without the building taken would be charged against the condemnor; the true market value of the remaining portion of the condemnee's land without the building, of course, it being destroyed, would be compared with the value of that tract before taking. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.

       - In condemnation cases, the sole question for the consideration of the jury, upon an appeal from an award of the assessors or from an award of a special master, is the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee for the property taken under the condemnation proceeding and the amount of damages to the remaining property of the condemnee, if any.

     <p>
      In case either party is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessors' award, he or they may, within ten days from the time the award is filed, enter in writing an appeal from the award to the superior court of the county where the award is filed. At the term succeeding the filing of the appeal, it shall be the duty of the judge to cause an issue to be made and tried by a jury as to the value of the property or interest taken or the amount of damage done, with the same right to move for a new trial and file an appeal as in other cases at law.

       Legislature intended to concern itself with time after which appeal may not be filed,
      
      with no regard to the time when filing is premature, except that of course the award of the assessors must be in existence, and the rights of the parties fixed, in order that there may be something to appeal from. The filing itself is not essential to the validity but only to the enforceability of the award. Hodges v. South Ga. Natural Gas Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 180</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Award of assessors, standing alone, is not judgment of court
      
      since the judgment is entered up by the court based on the award, but it is a judgment rendered by a tribunal which is competent to fix the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings with reference to the matters and things involved. It can be amended only by permission of the court. Hodges v. South Ga. Natural Gas Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 180</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1965).

       - Since the Board of Assessors did not file and record their award, apparently on the belief that the parties had decided on their own what the just compensation was for the condemnor obtaining the right of way, the 10-day time period for filing an appeal to a jury from the time the award was filed never arose and the condemnee was not barred from filing an appeal to a jury.

       An appeal to the superior court from an award of assessors in a condemnation proceeding is a de novo investigation, if the assessors had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The issue on appeal cannot be broadened so as to raise questions other than those as to compensation. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., <cite class="ga_court">120 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E. 15</cite>, 1 Ann. Cas. 734 (1904); Atlanta Terra Cotta Co. v. Georgia Ry. &amp; Elec.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In condemnation proceedings, the only issue before the assessors or a jury on appeal is the amount of compensation to be paid, and neither the assessors nor a jury can determine whether the condemnor is proceeding legally; the remedy of the landowners is to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the illegal proceedings. Garden Parks v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 31</cite> (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The sole question to be passed upon by the assessors, or a jury in the superior court on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid. Whether the quantity of land sought to be taken is necessary and proper for the purpose for which it is sought is a question not involved in such a proceeding. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       As a general rule the only issue before the jury relative to lands taken is its market value at the time of the taking. State Hwy. Dep't v. Howell, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 606</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 213</cite> (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While all relevant legal and equitable issues may be raised in an appeal from the assessors' award in a condemnation proceeding, the sole issue for the jury is value. All other issues, including the necessary fact finding, are for the determination of the court. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An appeal to the superior court jury is on the issue of value and damages alone. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 63</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 304</cite> (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An appeal from an award of assessors is a trial de novo on the question of compensation, and it is the function and duty of the jury to pass upon the issues independently of the award of the assessors. DeKalb County v. Queen, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 624</cite> (1975).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Notwithstanding a provision in an agreement submitting issues to arbitration under the Civil Practice Act, that the arbitrators should proceed "as in condemnation proceedings," and providing for an "appeal" from the award to the superior court, the award of the arbitrators was a statutory award, to be governed by the Civil Practice Act. Georgia Power Co. v. Friar, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 675</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 210</cite> (1933), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 470</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 807</cite> (1934).

        Condemnee should be allowed to show rental income from property,
       
       not for the purpose of being compensated for lost future revenue, but for the purpose of showing the use and location as affecting the value of the property. DeKalb County v. Queen, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 624</cite> (1975).

        When jury tries case upon appeals of both condemnor and condemnee,
       
       the trial is valid and binding, assuming that the appeal of the condemnor is invalid and alone would not give the court jurisdiction. Liberson v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">98 Ga. App. 255</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 376</cite> (1958).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the amount of the final judgment is less than the award made by the assessors, the condemnee is not liable for the payment of interest on the difference in the amount of the award and the judgment except from the date of the judgment. City of Atlanta v. Lunsford, <cite class="ga_app_court">105 Ga. App. 247</cite>, <cite class="app_court">124 S.E.2d 493</cite> (1962).

        When tenth day following assessor's award falls on Saturday and condemnee files appeal two days thereafter,
       
       the entry of a judgment on an assessor's award only two days after the award was filed is premature. McAllister v. City of Jonesboro, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 260</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 666</cite> (1979).

        In appeal from assessment after land has been condemned to establish new road

       - Although the condemnor tendered compensation into the trial court's registry that appeared to represent the sum the condemnor and condemnee had agreed was sufficient compensation, the tender of the award did not affect the condemnee's right to appeal to a jury.

       - When the condemnor paid into the registry of the court the sum awarded to the condemnee by the appointed assessors, and the court paid the sum to the condemnee, the condemnor appealed from the assessors' award, and the court entered judgment for the condemnor for the difference between the assessors' award and the jury's verdict, the award of interest at seven percent per annum from the date the condemnee withdrew the award from the court was improper.

        <p>
       - The filing of a suit by a condemnee independently of condemnation proceedings and subsequently to the award of the appraisers, in which latter case the condemnee sought to obtain a general judgment for damages, did not affect the right of the condemnee to proceed to have an execution issued on the award in the manner prescribed by this section.

       Requirement of payment of costs is for benefit of officers of court
      
      and not a condition precedent to the filing of an appeal. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).

       Clerk is not bound to receive appeal until costs have been paid to the clerk,
      
      but if the clerk does receive an appeal without exacting the costs, the appeal is good, and the clerk becomes estopped from saying that the costs have not been paid to the clerk - estopped as to all persons, at least, except the appellant.

      Upon the payment by the condemnor of the amount of the award, or the amount of the final judgment if there is an appeal, the condemnor shall become vested with such interest in the property taken as may be necessary to enable the condemnor to exercise his franchise or conduct his business. Whenever the condemnor ceases using the property taken for the purpose of conducting his business, the property shall revert to the person from whom taken, his heirs or assigns. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section, whenever any municipality condemns land for protection against floods and freshets, that municipality may acquire a fee simple title to the property condemned on payment of the condemnation money. When such municipality has a population of more than 250,000 according to the last or any future decennial census of the United States, such municipality, or the county in which the major portion of such municipality is located, shall acquire a fee simple title to the property condemned upon payment of the condemnation money.

       - The appropriation to public use amounts to a withdrawal only from such private uses as will interfere with the public use. Private use is of course to be subordinated to the public use, but, when the fee remains in the owner, the owner is entitled to make any use of the property which is not inconsistent with its use for the purpose for which it was taken.

        When corporation acquires right to use property by condemnation,
       
       the condemnation does not vest in the condemnor only a personal right of use during the life or ownership of the condemnor, but vests the interest condemned in the condemnor just as though it had been conveyed to it. Florida Blue Ridge Corp. v. Tennessee Elec. Power Co., 106 F.2d 913 (5th Cir. 1939), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">309 U.S. 666</cite>, <cite class="s_court">60 S.

        When business is transferred to another who continues to use condemned property as before,
       
       the condemnor is still using it through the transferee, even though one die, or be dissolved if a corporation and the right to the use of the property acquired through condemnation does not cease.

      Procedure not available for taking property previously dedicated to public use.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - In absence of express authority, the condemning procedure authorized by Ga. L. 1957, p. 387,
   §
   1 et seq. is not available for use by condemnors who seek to take property previously dedicated to a public use. Georgia S. &amp; Fla. Ry. v. City of Warner Robins, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 370</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 151</cite> (1963).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Condemnor chooses its method of procedure,
    
    and it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. The property owner is also bound, although the owner did not choose the method of procedure. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    If the condemnor elects to use the Special Master Law, then it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 919</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite> (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Condemnor has no rights except those expressly granted to it by statute,
    
    and those rights can be exercised only when every prerequisite to their exercise has been fully met. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Large discretion is vested in condemnor in selection of property to be condemned,
    
    and such selection should not be interfered with or controlled by the courts, unless made in bad faith, or capriciously or wantonly injurious, or in some respect beyond the privilege conferred by statute or its charter.

    In condemnation cases, the sole question for the consideration of the jury, upon an appeal from an award of the assessors or from an award of a special master, is the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee for the property taken under the condemnation proceeding and the amount of damages to the remaining property of the condemnee, if any.

       - Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover.

      This article shall be supplementary to and cumulative of the methods of condemnation described in Articles 1 and 3 of this chapter in cases in which the state, or any branch of the government of the state, or any county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state, or any housing authority, or any other person possessing the power of eminent domain is concerned. This article is intended to provide a simpler and more effective method of condemnation in those cases where a judicial supervision of the proceedings is desirable by reason of the necessity for a quick determination of the just and adequate compensation to be paid the owner of the property or interest subject to be condemned, or by reason of the number of parties at interest or the conflicting interests of such parties, or in cases where there are parties who are non compos mentis or who are not sui juris or who are nonresidents, or in cases where there are conflicting interests or doubtful questions. In all particulars not otherwise specially provided for in this article, the court shall conform its procedure as nearly as possible to Articles 1 and 3 of this chapter.

       - The special master method of condemnation is intended to be an expeditious method of arriving at the just and adequate compensation to be paid a citizen before the citizen's interest in property may be condemned; allowing a condemnee to raise, for the first time on appeal from the special master's award, the right of the condemnor to take the property sought to be condemned, would obstruct this purpose.

       - Though the primary duty of the special master is to ascertain the value of the property sought to be condemned, the special master is authorized to hear and determine any legal objections that may be raised by the parties, including, the right of the condemnor to condemn, the interest, the nature of the interest taken and the effect of the condemnation upon the respective rights of the parties.

       - It is clear that in enacting Ga. L. 1957, p. 387,
   §

       - A condemnor may amend its petition by striking two paragraphs describing the proposed right of way and the uses of the right of way, and stating two new paragraphs, where all that the amendment does is to put the condemnees on notice of a more specific description of the right of way sought to be condemned and the proposed use of the right of way.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - If the special master makes findings not only as to just and adequate compensation for the property taken but also as to other matters material to the condemnee's respective rights, the proper method for the condemnee to obtain judicial review of the special master's findings in regard to matters other than the just and adequate compensation for the property taken is to file objections to the special master's award prior to the court entering an order and making the award a judgment of the court. Georgia Power Co. v. Baggarley, <cite class="ga_app_court">133 Ga. App. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">211 S.E.2d 23</cite> (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When legal objections are raised before and passed upon by the special master, to obtain review of these objections exceptions must be taken to the master's findings prior to the superior court's entry of an order and judgment condemning the property. If no exceptions are taken and the master's findings are made the judgment of the court, the court's judgment is final insofar as it adjudicates these legal issues, until set aside or reversed in a manner provided by law.

       - The failure of a party to file exceptions to the master's award for determination by the superior court results in a waiver of the party's right to further litigate any nonvalue issues.

        Condemnation award and judgment, unexcepted to and unappealed from, is res judicata

       - The original arbiter is no longer merely a person especially equipped to determine value; the arbiter is a competent attorney under oath especially appointed by the court. The arbiter is, accordingly, an arm of the court, and the arbiter's decision is judicial or at least quasi-judicial. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga.

        Special master's rulings and findings may be excepted to in trial court

        <p>
       - Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover. Ga. Power Co. v. Stowers, <cite class="ga_app_court">282 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">639 S.E.2d 605</cite> (2006).

       - Although the relationship and accountability of a special master to the court was that of an auditor, a special master was not obligated by Ga. L. 1957, p. 387,

        Recommittal of the action to a new special master was proper
       
       since the trial court found that the special master failed to apply the Georgia law relating to condemnation proceedings and found the award of the special master to be "incomplete" based on the failure of the special master to determine the just and adequate compensation of the property or interest taken.

        - The payment of property taxes is a responsibility of the landowner only so long as the landowner, in fact, owns the property. The property owner or condemnee would be responsible for payment of taxes up to the date of taking; after that time, the responsibility for the payment of these taxes would lie upon the condemning body, if in fact that body is an entity which would have the responsibility for payment of these taxes. 1969 Op.

        There are only two elements of damages to be considered in condemnation proceeding:
       
       first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of it to the purposes for which it is condemned. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Anything that actually enhances value of land must be considered
       
       in order to meet the constitutional demand that the owner be paid before the taking, adequate and just compensation. DOT v. Arnold, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 502</cite>, <cite class="app_court">268 S.E.2d 775</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:
       
       replacement cost new less depreciation, income, and comparable sales. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Measure of consequential damages,
       
       if any, to the property which the condemnee retains, is the market value of the remainder in its circumstances just prior to the time of the taking, as compared with its market value in its new circumstances just after the time of the taking. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).

        Land and its natural components

       The only relevant inquiry in an appeal from the amount awarded by the special master was the overall value of the property condemned pursuant to this Article, with the fact that the property contained "chewacla" soil being taken into account; the trial court did not err in excluding irrelevant testimony as to the separate value of the "chewacla" soil located on the property. Williams v. Mayor of Carrollton, <cite class="ga_app_court">195 Ga. App. 590</cite>, <cite class="app_court">394 S.E.2d 389</cite> (1990).

       - Adjoining owners of property or operators of businesses on property adjoining a street or highway have no vested interest in the traffic pattern which controlling authorities may provide for the public street from time to time. If they suffer damage when the pattern is changed it is a damage suffered by members of the general public owning property or operating businesses adjacent to a street or highway, and for which there can be no recovery.

       - Market value of property taken by the Department of Transportation is a matter of opinion, and may be established by direct as well as circumstantial evidence; it is peculiarly a matter for the jury, and the jury is not absolutely bound even by uncontradicted testimony of experts, but may consider the nature of the property involved, together with any other fact or circumstance properly within the knowledge of the jury which tends to establish the value of the property, and may arrive at a different figure than that of the experts, higher or lower, when the verdict reached is not so disparate as to justify an inference of gross mistake or undue bias.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When an expert witness testifies as to the value of property in a condemnation case, and the examination of the witness discloses that the witness's examination of the property had been made both before and after the date of taking, this does not prevent the witness's testimony from having probative value as to the date of taking when the witness testifies as to the witness's familiarity with the property as of the date of taking. The witness's entire testimony cannot be excluded. West v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 255</cite>, <cite class="app_court">180 S.E.2d 277</cite> (1971).

        It was not error to fail to charge on consequential benefits

       - When a limited access highway is condemned by the state, which highway cuts off several acres from the remainder of the land of the condemnee leaving those several acres without any access thereto, testimony offered by the condemnor that with access there would be no damage to the isolated land, standing alone, is inadmissible and without probative value on the question of consequential damages to those several acres without access.

         Appeal in superior court only method of correcting special master's errors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The only method of correcting any errors the assessors or a special master may have made in the original hearing and award is not by recommittal to that body but by an appeal in the superior court, which begins again the process of adjudication. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 63</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 304</cite> (1975); Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 919</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite> (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If an appeal is taken by any party to a jury, the trial judge commits error in remanding the case to the special master. The trial judge should rule on all legal issues, either by pretrial order or during the course of the trial, in the jury case pending before the judge. Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">237 Ga. 358</cite>, <cite class="app_court">227 S.E.2d 362</cite> (1976); Walker v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">177 Ga. App. 493</cite>, <cite class="app_court">339 S.E.2d 728</cite> (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The trial judge erred when the judge determined that the judge was not going to conduct the proceedings de novo but instead decided to review the decision of the special master on nonvalue issues as though occupying an appellate position in the proceedings, thereby addressing only whether there was any evidence to support the special master's findings of fact and whether there were any errors of law in the special master's conclusions of law. Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga.

        <p>
       - If an appeal is taken pursuant to this section to a jury in the superior court, the trial in the superior court is a de novo proceeding, and it is the duty of the trial judge, by pretrial order or during the course of the trial, to rule on all legal issues. Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">237 Ga. 358</cite>, <cite class="app_court">227 S.E.2d 362</cite> (1976).

       <p>
        <p>
       An appeal by either party from the award of a special master is a de novo proceeding. Accordingly, if the case is tried again and the jury reaches a verdict smaller than the prepaid special master's award, the payor would be entitled to a judgment against the payee for the difference.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The sole question to be passed upon by the assessors, or a jury in the superior court on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid. Whether the quantity of land sought to be taken is necessary and proper for the purpose for which it is sought is a question not involved in such a proceeding. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When an appeal is taken from a special master's award to a jury in the superior court pursuant to this section, the only issue for decision by the jury is the value of the subject property taken. Taylor v. Taylor County, <cite class="ga_court">231 Ga. 209</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E.2d 887</cite> (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While all issues may be raised in an appeal from the special master's award, the question of value is the sole issue to be submitted to the jury, and its fact-finding powers are limited to those facts directly touching on value.

       One who does not except to the findings of the special master or appeal from the judgment of condemnation cannot, on the usual appeal to a jury on the question of value, raise legal issues by way of counterclaim or motion.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t22c02s22-2-112" target="_self">22-2-112</a></cite> was an inappropriate method of appealing, and the company's failure to take exception to the findings acted as a waiver of its right to appeal.

       Since the condemnor never filed an exception to the special master's award concerning the requirement that it give the landowner advance notice of its entry onto the easement in non-emergency situations, and the superior court made the special master's award the judgment of the court, the trial court was correct when it determined that the notice provision was a viable portion of the condemnation judgment.

       Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover.

       Condemnation of a property owner's land by a city was upheld on appeal, as was the trial court's judgment entered upon a jury verdict in the amount of $63,361 for the property and an award of attorney fees to the city, because the property owner never challenged the valuation made by a special master and also removed the amount awarded from the registry, thereby estopping the owner from challenging the legality of the taking on appeal.

       Judgment authorized by this section is clearly in personam judgment.
      
      Atlanta Whses., Inc. v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">143 Ga. App. 588</cite>, <cite class="app_court">239 S.E.2d 387</cite> (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Condemnor cannot insist upon its right to take property and refuse to pay the amount awarded
      
      to the condemnee at the same time. State Hwy. Dep't v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 15</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 703</cite> (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       One cannot voluntarily accept money awarded for one's property and still contest right to condemn,
      
      but such acceptance in no way precludes one from protesting the value amount of the award. Tingle v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">150 Ga. App. 867</cite>, <cite class="app_court">258 S.E.2d 668</cite> (1979).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t22c02s22-2-113" target="_self">22-2-113</a></cite> states that the acceptance of the award "shall not prevent any party from prosecuting the appeal," this language is not applicable to appeals in which the condemnee challenges the right to condemn, as opposed to the amount of the award. Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">203 Ga. App. 241</cite>, <cite class="app_court">416 S.E.2d 562</cite> (1992).

       - If an appeal to a jury is desired it must be filed within ten days after the filing of the award or it becomes final. Hardy v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 748</cite> (1979).

       - It is obvious that the General Assembly in using the word "owner" not only intended it to have its ordinary signification, but in doing so, also distinguished the owner from other condemnees.

        <p>
       - When a proceeding in rem is brought to condemn property for a public use, tender of the amount awarded by the special master to the apparent or ostensible owner of such property is not a condition precedent to the condemnor's right to pay the award into the registry of the court and enter an appeal to a jury. Hunt v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_app_court">101 Ga. App. 797</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 384</cite> (1960); Tillman v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_app_court">101 Ga.

        <p>

        Refusal by clerk of superior court to pay over amount awarded to condemnee,
       
       which had been paid to such clerk by the condemnor in connection with its appeal for a jury trial is not a proper ground for dismissal of such appeal because when the condemnor pays the amount of the award of the assessors into the registry of the court, the condemnor is not thereafter concerned with its distribution, and, further, such condemnor is not responsible for the clerk's actions.

     The purpose of this special condemnation statute
    
    is to afford a speedy and fair means whereby the public authorities may acquire a clear title to the lands sought for public purposes, and the landowner and all parties concerned may receive their just compensation therefor. Denham v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 790</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 631</cite> (1936).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    The purpose and the mandatory requirement of Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
   §
   1 et seq. is for the condemnor to pay the amount of the award into the registry of the court so that it may be disbursed after a judgment has been taken against the property described in the petition and to those responding parties whom the judge, after hearing their respective claims thereto, finds to be justly entitled. Kreutz v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 315</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 134</cite> (1963).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     In proceeding under Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
    
    §
    
     1 et seq., speedy action and progress is to be obtained
    
    so far as possible, and the statutes providing therefor must be strictly pursued. Denham v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 790</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 631</cite> (1936).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Fact that State of Georgia is condemnor does not deprive condemnee of equal protection of law
    
    since the condemnee is authorized to make any valid defense in the condemnation proceeding itself. Russell v. Venable, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 137</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 103</cite> (1960).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
    
    §
    
     1 et seq. is general law, and may be amended by another general law
    
    in accord with the state Constitution. Russell v. Venable, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 137</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 103</cite> (1960).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
    
    §
    
     1 et seq. makes adequate provision for anyone claiming interest to assert equitable as well as legal rights
    
    to the property in the condemnation proceeding itself. Mitchell v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 88</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    All legal and equitable issues relevant to the condemnation of a piece of land may be raised in a single proceeding, unless principles of waiver or estoppel apply. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     All matters in opposition to petition to condemn property must be filed in condemnation proceeding,
    
    when the petition is filed under the provisions of Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
   §
   1 et seq. Howard v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">140 S.E.2d 880</cite> (1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Prior to enactment of Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
    
    §
    
     1 et seq., there were no pleadings in condemnation proceeding,
    
    and no hearings provided for before the presiding judge prior to appeal; questions pertaining to the right to condemn, the constitutionality of the proceedings, and similar questions, could be made by the condemnee only in a separate bill in equity. Martin v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).

   §
   1 et seq., a bill for injunction will lie when the remedy at law is not adequate and complete. Martin v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t22c02s22-2-132" target="_self">22-2-132</a></cite>) specifically provides the nature and character of the objections which may be urged before the presiding judge, which include "any other matters material to their respective rights"; matters pertaining to the rights of the condemnee might therefore be raised by general and special demurrers (now motions to dismiss) as in other cases, and an adverse ruling on a general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) can be reviewed by a direct bill of exceptions prior to any final judgment in the condemnation case. Martin v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).
    </p>

     <p>

     Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
    
    §
    
     1 et seq. does not provide for any method of review of interlocutory orders,
    
    and the only final judgment in this proceeding is the judgment of award. Stewart v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="ga_app_court">66 Ga. App. 108</cite>, <cite class="app_court">17 S.E.2d 203</cite> (1941).

     Condemnee cannot halt proceedings at any stage before appointment of assessors and award

    - The provisions of former Code 1933,
   §
   6-503 (see O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.05.html#t05c03s5-3-8" target="_blank">5-3-8</a></cite>) required the consent of the opposite party before an appeal may be dismissed, were applicable to appeals in condemnation proceedings instituted under Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Issue of whether condemnee intends to dedicate land to public use
    
    is an issue that the trial judge should rule on in a pretrial order. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    Whether a condemnee dedicated a large portion of the land to public use is a mixed question of law and fact concerning the nature and amount of the land in issue, and its determination is for the trial judge. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    When there is no express dedication for public use and the requisite intent must be implied, the acts relied upon to establish such dedication must be such as clearly showed a purpose on the part of the owner to abandon the owner's own personal dominion over such property, and to devote the property to a definite public use. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     When condemnor pays award of assessors into registry of court,
    
    the condemnor is not thereafter concerned with the award's distribution. Kreutz v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 315</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 134</cite> (1963).

     <p>
    - When a proceeding in rem is brought to condemn property for a public use under the provisions of Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
   §
   1 et seq., tender of the amount awarded by the assessors to the apparent or ostensible owner of such property is not a condition precedent to the condemnor's right to pay the award into the registry of the court and enter an appeal to a jury. State Hwy. Dep't v. Farmers Gin Co., <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 70</cite>, <cite class="app_court">114 S.E.2d 537</cite>, answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga.

    <p>
     <p>
    - While all issues may be raised in an appeal from the assessors' award, the question of value is the sole issue to be submitted to the jury, and its fact-finding powers are limited to those facts directly touching on value.

        <p>
       - The 1937-1938 amendment to this section permits counties to condemn land by petition under the provisions of Ga. L. 1914, p. 92,
   §
   1 et seq. Hoch v. Candler, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 390</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Under the 1937-1938 amendment to this section, it is not necessary that the condemnation petition allege an unsuccessful effort to procure the land by contract or a failure to agree as to compensation. Hoch v. Candler, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 390</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Prior negotiations to procure land from owner by contract are not necessary
       
       in a proceeding brought under this section. St. Clair v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">45 Ga. App. 488</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 297</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Venue of in rem proceeding is in county in which land lies;
       
       but if the tract of land lies in two counties, such proceeding can be brought in the superior court of either county. Cook v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">162 Ga. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">132 S.E. 902</cite> (1926).

       - It is the duty of persons claiming an interest in property sought to be condemned to establish the amount and character of the interest claimed, and in such a proceeding all interests may be condemned, whether acquired by easement or by fee simple title to the property.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Owners of remainder interest in property who were not made parties to an in rem proceeding to condemn that property for a public purpose could obtain monetary relief for the value of their remaindermant but could not set aside the judgment of condemnation awarding title to a public body. Nelson v. State, <cite class="ga_court">254 Ga. 611</cite>, <cite class="app_court">331 S.E.2d 554</cite> (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Court may enjoin condemnor from taking possession of and entering upon land
       
       until the issues made by the petition and defensive pleadings have been determined. Mitchell v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 88</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Condemnor cannot just abandon condemnation proceeding.
       
       Marist Soc'y v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Tender or payment of award is necessary before property may be taken
       
       or the work thereon commenced. Wilson v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_app_court">85 Ga. App. 907</cite>, <cite class="app_court">70 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When no motion for new trial is made and no exception taken to verdict and judgment
       
       following an appeal by the condemnor to the superior court, the land is condemned to public servitude subject only to payment of the amount of compensation fixed by the verdict and judgment. Harrison v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 290</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 445</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        To vacate and set aside judgment for value of property condemned,
       
       affirmative action seeking to set aside judgment in favor of condemnor, and payment of all expenses and damages accrued to the condemnee, are essential. Marist Soc'y v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1955).
       </p>

        County authorities may by petition condemn land for road

       - Under this section, the state can, in one proceeding, condemn a right of way over two tracts of land, one owned by one of the plaintiffs and the other owned by both plaintiffs, the proceeding being one in rem and not against the individuals. In such a proceeding, all persons interested will be allotted the damages to which they are respectively entitled. Cook v. State Hwy.

       - Previous condemnation proceeding by petition of the county authorities was not subject to attack by the present injunction petition of the former landowner, as containing an insufficient description of the condemned land, when the description in the former proceeding identified the property as being described in plans on file in the office of the road commissioner of the county, and when the petition neither denied the existence of such plans and description nor alleged any fact showing their insufficiency.

       This section specifically provides nature and character of objections which may be urged
      
      before the presiding judge, which include "any other matters material to their respective rights"; matters pertaining to the rights of the condemnee might therefore be raised by general and special demurrers as in other cases, and an adverse ruling on a general demurrer can be reviewed by a direct bill of exceptions prior to any final judgment in the condemnation case. Martin v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).

       Appeal from condemnation award is de novo investigation.
      
      State Hwy. Dep't v. Hester, <cite class="ga_app_court">112 Ga. App. 51</cite>, <cite class="app_court">143 S.E.2d 658</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Appeal from award of assessors to jury in superior court was not a suit
      
      within the provisions of former Code 1933,
   §
   85-1802 (see O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.44.html#t44c12s44-12-21" target="_blank">44-12-21</a></cite>). State Hwy. Dep't v. Noble, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 410</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Appeal does not require any process
      
      as is required in all suits at law. State Hwy. Dep't v. Noble, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 410</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Requirement of payment of costs is for benefit of officers of court
      
      and not a condition precedent to the filing of an appeal. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Clerk is not bound to receive appeal until costs have been paid to the clerk,
      
      but if the clerk does receive an appeal without exacting the costs, the appeal is good, and the clerk becomes estopped from saying that the costs have not been paid to the clerk - estopped as to all persons, at least, except the appellant. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Failure of condemnor to pay costs and fees within ten days after judgment does not vitiate its appeal
      
      therefrom regardless of whether or not it is a political subdivision of the state. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).

         Waiver of right to have costs paid in advance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When a magistrate refuses to dismiss an appeal because costs have not been paid by the appellant, this amounts to a waiver of the right to have the costs paid in advance, and the appellee has no right to complain of the refusal to dismiss the appeal. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).
       </p>
       <p>

        Party's failure to sign appeal is amendable defect

       <p>

       What is just and adequate compensation is justiciable question,
      
      and only the judiciary can lawfully determine that question. Calhoun v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 65</cite>, <cite class="app_court">153 S.E.2d 418</cite> (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       There are only two elements of damages to be considered in condemnation proceeding:
      
      first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of it to the purposes for which it is condemned. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).

         Measure of damages is pecuniary loss sustained by owner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The measure of damages for property taken by the right of eminent domain, being compensatory in its nature, is the pecuniary loss sustained by the owner, taking into consideration all relevant factors. Ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be the fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. Polk v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">96 Ga. App. 733</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 736</cite> (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Anything that actually enhances value of land must be considered
       
       in order to meet the constitutional demand that the owner be paid before the taking, adequate and just compensation. DOT v. Arnold, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 502</cite>, <cite class="app_court">268 S.E.2d 775</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:
       
       replacement cost new less depreciation, income, and comparable sales. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Measure of consequential damages,
       
       if any, to the property which the condemnee retains, is the market value of the remainder in its circumstances just prior to the time of the taking, as compared with its market value in its new circumstances just after the time of the taking. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Land and its natural components
       
       are one subject matter and what is required is evidence of the fair market value of that one subject matter. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Improvements on land are proper subjects for independent valuation
       
       in consideration of the just and adequate compensation for the total property taken. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Existing zoning regulations can be pertinent
       
       in a condemnation proceeding. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Attorneys' fees need not be included
       
       in the measure of just compensation under the Georgia Constitution. Georgia Power Co. v. Sanders, 617 F.2d 1112 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">450 U.S. 936</cite>, <cite class="s_court">101 S. Ct. 1403</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">67 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 372 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Lost profits may be used as means of awarding just and adequate compensation
       
       because the income approach necessarily takes into account what future earnings would be were the property interest not extinguished. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).

       - Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" such that fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when they are not of type generally bought or sold in the open market.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Neither "privacy," which is inherent in ownership of all property, nor the fact that the condemned land was "riverfront" property, would authorize a charge on the condemned property having a value "peculiar" to the owner, or that the realty was "unique." Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 592</cite> (1983).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a business belongs to the landowner, total destruction of the business at the location must be proven before business losses may be recovered as a separate element of compensation. DOT v.

       When the business belongs to a separate lessee, the lessee may recover for business losses as an element of compensation separate from the value of the land whether the destruction of one's business is total or merely partial, provided only that the loss is not remote or speculative.

       - When a limited access highway is condemned by the state, which highway cuts off several acres from the remainder of the land of the condemnee leaving those several acres without any access thereto, testimony offered by the condemnor that with access there would be no damage to the isolated land, standing alone, is inadmissible and without probative value on the question of consequential damages to those several acres without access.

       - In a condemnation action, an expert was properly allowed to testify that a temporary easement had not diminished the fair market value of the land.

       - When an owner's property would probably be rezoned, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in admitting the evidence thereof; however, testimony of the "highest and best use" of the property, by itself, was inadmissible when it involved a use precluded by the applicable zoning regulations in effect as of the date of taking.

       - Competent evidence as to any improvement in or benefit to the business of certain property owners, conducted upon their city property, contiguous to and fronting on a street resulting from the paving of the street by the city, would be admissible in a suit brought by the property owners against the city for damage to their property, as tending to show that petitioners' property has been enhanced in value by reason of such public improvement, in order to set off the damages claimed by the petitioners.

       <p>
        <p>
       The fact that other property, similarly situated, abutting upon the street paved, was also enhanced in value and received benefits from this improvement, is admissible to show in a general way that plaintiffs' property was also enhanced in value and received benefits from such paving.

      When the condemnation is fully completed, the award, whether made by assessors or by the verdict of a jury, together with the decree of the court based thereon and a full and complete description of the property or interest condemned or duly certified copies of such award, decree, and description, shall be filed and recorded in the records of deeds in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the land so condemned lies. If the land lies in more than one county, such filing and recording shall be made in each county in which the land lies. The clerk shall be entitled to the same fees for such filing and recording as are allowed by law for the filing and recording of deeds, said fees to be paid by the party in whose favor said condemnation is had.

      This article is intended to be supplementary to and cumulative of Articles 1 and 2 of this chapter in cases in which the State of Georgia, the United States, or any person having the privilege of exercising the right of eminent domain is concerned. This article is also intended to make simpler and more effective the method of condemnation in those cases where conflicting interests or doubtful questions render a judicial supervision of the procedure desirable. In all particulars not otherwise specially provided for in this article, the court shall conform its procedure as nearly as possible to Articles 1 and 2 of this chapter, and the same shall remain in force.

    The necessity for taking private property for public use is a question for legislative determination, and the provisions relating to such taking are not, because they fail to provide for a special tribunal to pass upon such necessity, violative of the constitutional prohibition against taking the property without due process of law.

      There need be but one condemnation proceeding against the same railroad company, which proceeding may be conducted in any county where service can be made upon the company as provided in Code Section 22-3-2. However, if the railroad company has a main or principal office located in this state, the proceeding shall be conducted in the county in which the main or principal office is located. The assessors shall make their findings of the damages to which the railroad company may be entitled by reason of the construction, maintenance, and operation of the telegraph or telephone lines in the manner set out in the notice.

      The General Assembly finds and declares that the prompt and equitable relocation and reestablishment of persons, businesses, farmers, and nonprofit organizations displaced when the state, any of its agencies or institutions (other than the Department of Transportation), or any county, municipal corporation, school district, political subdivision, public authority, public agency, public corporation, or public instrumentality, excluding electric membership corporations as defined in paragraph (3) of Code Section 46-3-171, (collectively referred to in this chapter as "several public entities") created under the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia acquires land, with federal financial assistance, for a public use, are necessary to ensure that certain individuals do not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole. The General Assembly finds and declares that the establishment of uniform fair land acquisition policies will be beneficial to the public. The General Assembly finds that the Congress of the United States has, by enacting the Uniform Act, made funds available for relocation assistance and the implementation of certain land acquisition policies. The General Assembly further finds that the Congress of the United States has by the aforesaid statute provided for the total cessation after July 1, 1972, of federal financial assistance for public works projects which will displace persons or businesses unless the state complies with the requirements of the Uniform Act. The General Assembly finds and declares that the construction of public works projects with federal financial assistance is vital to the state and is in the best interest of the people of the state and that providing for the continuation of federal financial assistance at the highest possible level for public works projects is a legitimate public purpose. The General Assembly further finds that the cost of providing the assistance and services provided for in this chapter should be, and the same are declared to be, part of the necessary cost of federal-aid public works projects.

      The several public entities shall have the authority, as a last resort, to provide replacement housing when a federal-aid project financed in whole or in part with federal aid cannot proceed to actual construction because no comparable replacement sale or rental housing is available. In carrying out the relocation assistance activities, the several public entities shall be authorized to make payments, construct or reconstruct with their own forces, cause to be constructed or reconstructed, and purchase by deed or condemnation any real property for the purposes of providing replacement housing. The acquiring public entity may exchange, lease, or sell to the displaced person such replacement housing. Whenever any real property has been acquired under this Code section and thereafter the acquiring public entity determines that all or any part of such property or any interest therein is no longer needed for such purposes because of changed conditions, the acquiring public entity is authorized to dispose of such property or interest therein in accordance with Code Section 50-16-144.
