     <p>
      On and after January 1, 2004, each state, county, and local law enforcement agency that conducts emergency response and vehicular pursuits shall adopt written policies that set forth the manner in which these operations shall be conducted. Each law enforcement agency may create its own such policies or adopt an existing model. All pursuit policies created or adopted by any law enforcement agency must address situations in which police pursuits cross over into other jurisdictions. Law enforcement agencies which do not comply with the requirements of this Code section are subject to the withholding of any state funding or state administered federal funding.

       - Since, during the trial of a state patrolman for false imprisonment, it appeared from the evidence that the patrolman's sole defense was that the patrolman made the arrest for drunkenness upon the public highway without a warrant because the patrolman, in good faith, had probable cause to believe that the offense was being committed in the patrolman's presence, a failure to instruct the jury on a good faith defense was an error, requiring the grant of a new trial.

        <p>
       - Since, during the trial of a state patrolman for false imprisonment, it appears from the evidence that the patrolman's sole defense was that the patrolman made the arrest for drunkenness upon the public highway without a warrant because the patrolman in good faith had probable cause to believe that the offense was being committed in the patrolman's presence, it is error, requiring the grant of a new trial, for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury on this defense.

        - When the function to be performed involves something other than the enforcement of traffic and motor vehicle laws, the enforcement of criminal laws on state property, or apprehending fugitives, some further requirement is necessary to authorize the activity; that further requirement may be either the Governor's direction to suppress riots or labor strikes or assist in a criminal case investigation, a local law enforcement request for assistance in a criminal matter, or the failure to prevent or detect a criminal act because of the unavailability of a local law enforcement officer at the time. 1987 Op.

       - If none of the triggering mechanisms for invoking the Uniform Division's authority is present, the Uniform Division is without authority to provide security for coaches and players or crowd control at professional, college, and high school sporting events in Georgia. 1987 Op.

        If a coach or anyone else is attacked in the presence of a trooper and there is no local law enforcement officer immediately available to respond, the trooper is a sworn officer and has a duty, recognized by statute, to intervene to stop the criminal act and arrest the attacker; in so doing, the trooper is acting within the scope of employment, and, under the terms of the present policy, is entitled to insurance coverage. However, there is no authority for the Uniform Division to provide private security, within or without the boundaries of Georgia. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-14.

      Any person wishing permission to use either department nomenclature or symbols may request such permission in writing to the commissioner. The commissioner shall serve notice on the requesting party within 15 calendar days after receipt of the request of his or her decision on whether the person may use the nomenclature or the symbol.

The grant of permission under Code Section 35-2-82 or 35-2-83 shall be in the discretion of the commissioner under such conditions as the commissioner may impose. If the commissioner denies such request and the person making such request reasonably believes that the commissioner has acted in bad faith or based on an illegal motive, then the person may, within 15 days after the person's request was denied or granted on limited terms, file an appeal with the Board of Public Safety. The matter will then be considered before the board, but the burden will be with the person making the request to show that the request was improperly denied or limited.

       - State proved that the false statement alleged in the indictment was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) because the GBI was actively investigating a missing person case; because two videos contained clues referencing a Georgia missing person and the location of a missing person's body parts in Augusta, and it was then determined that the computer from which the videos were being posted was in Georgia, the jury could reasonably infer that the other missing person cases referenced in the first video would have a Georgia connection, giving the GBI jurisdiction to investigate the cases.

       Upon the failure of a person without lawful excuse to obey a subpoena, the director, assistant director, or deputy director for investigations, through the prosecuting attorney, may apply to a superior court having jurisdiction for an order compelling compliance.

The court may issue an order modifying or setting aside such subpoena or directing compliance with the original subpoena.

       - State proved that the false statement alleged in the indictment was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) because: the GBI was actively investigating a missing person case; two videos contained clues referencing a Georgia missing person and the location of a missing person's body parts in Augusta; and, the computer from which the videos were being posted was in Georgia. Therefore, the jury could reasonably infer that the other missing person cases referenced in the first video would have a Georgia connection, giving the GBI jurisdiction to investigate the cases.

       - State proved that the false statement alleged in the indictment was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) because: the GBI was actively investigating a missing person case; two videos contained clues referencing a Georgia missing person and the location of a missing person's body parts in Augusta; and, the computer from which the videos were being posted was in Georgia. Therefore, the jury could reasonably infer that the other missing person cases referenced in the first video would have a Georgia connection, giving the GBI jurisdiction to investigate the cases.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-160" target="_self">35-3-160</a></cite>) did not authorize unreasonable searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment because the bodily intrusion of taking a blood or saliva sample was minimal, the state had a compelling interest in obtaining reliable and accurate identifying characteristics of individuals convicted of felonies, and those valid law enforcement interests outweighed a convicted felon's privacy interests; to the extent that probable cause or individualized suspicion was required to justify a search, the prisoners' felony convictions provided that justification.

XIII as Georgia's legitimate interest in creating a permanent identification record of convicted felons for law enforcement purposes outweighed the minor intrusion involved in taking prisoners' saliva samples and storing DNA profiles, given prisoners' a reduced expectation of privacy in the prisoners' identities.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-160" target="_self">35-3-160</a></cite>) did not violate that right because the statute promoted law enforcement, and was narrowly tailored to promote that purpose by requiring DNA profiling on a limited population of incarcerated felons and forbidding release of the DNA profiles except for law enforcement purposes.

        <p>
       Classification of subjecting convicted felons but not convicted misdemeanants to the DNA identification process was rationally related to the Georgia legislature's legitimate law enforcement purpose of creating a permanent identification record of convicted felons because the statute encompassed all convicted felons whose crimes and/or past histories were serious enough to warrant a sentence to confinement, as opposed to lesser punishment, and the legislature acted reasonably and not arbitrarily when the legislature focused on those convicted felons who were housed in a correctional facility where DNA samples can be efficiently and economically obtained.

      effective April 28, 2019, substituted the present provisions of subsection (a) for the former provisions, which read: "A person whose DNA profile has been included in the data bank pursuant to this article may request that it be expunged on the grounds that the conviction on which the authority for including his or her DNA profile was based has been reversed and the case dismissed. The bureau shall purge all records and identifiable information in the data bank pertaining to the person and destroy all samples from the person upon receipt of a written request that such data be expunged, pursuant to this Code section, and a certified copy of the court order reversing and dismissing the conviction."; and substituted "shall be authorized until it is expunged as set forth in subsection (a) of this Code section" for "is authorized until a court order directing expungement is obtained and submitted to the bureau" in the middle of subsection (b).

      The General Assembly finds that the high incidence of crime in Georgia is detrimental to the general welfare of the state and its citizens and that criminal justice efforts must be better coordinated, intensified, and made more effective in all components of the system and at all levels of government. The General Assembly, therefore, declares it to be the public policy of this state to provide the necessary leadership to coordinate the major components of the criminal justice system by establishing a state-wide coordinating body which represents all components and all levels of the criminal justice system.

The General Assembly further finds that the work of some of these agencies overlaps, and that the at-risk families and troubled children of Georgia will be more efficiently and effectively served by consolidating the Children and Youth Coordinating Council with the Children's Trust Fund Commission, by placing the functions of the Georgia Child Fatality Review Panel under the supervision of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children, and by encouraging these consolidated agencies to collaborate to create a consistent vision for serving the needs of our state's families in need."

       - Under the police power, a deputy sheriff is authorized to go upon private property and direct the owner to move back from a burning building, when the deputy has been made aware of the possibility of an explosion, and in the deputy's opinion the safety of a 21/2-year-old child was unnecessarily endangered because of the proximity to the burning structure.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court erred by entering a default judgment against a police officer for failing to timely answer because the officer was immune from suit on the claim brought under state law; thus, the default judgment entered on that claim was a nullity and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and should have dismissed the state law cause of action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

        <p>
       - With respect to law enforcement officers claiming qualified immunity in a case alleging that certain searches violated Fourth Amendment rights, the officers could show that the officers were acting within the officers' discretionary authority because it is clear that performing searches and assisting in arrests are legitimate job-related functions within the power of law enforcement bodies under O.C.G.A.

       - Because a peace officer's invocation of a right against self-incrimination could not shield that officer from an inquiry into the effect of that assertion on the officer's job performance, and because the record supported an administrative decision that the officer's refusal to cooperate in an investigation provided sufficient grounds for the Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council to enter an order of decertification, the superior court erred in reversing an administrative law judge's decision upholding the decertification and finding that the officer's actions amounted to unprofessional conduct.

      It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any municipal or county police department or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the municipal or county police department or a member thereof. Furthermore, the municipal or county police department, which has provided quality law enforcement services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the department, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any municipal or county police department's name or any term used to identify the department or its members without the expressed permission of the local governing authority. The provisions of this chapter are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.
