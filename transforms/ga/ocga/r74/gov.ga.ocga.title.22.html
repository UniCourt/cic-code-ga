       The right of eminent domain is the right of this state, through its regular organization, to reassert, either temporarily or permanently, its dominion over any portion of the soil of this state on account of public exigency and for the public good. Thus, in time of war or insurrection the proper authorities may possess and hold any part of the territory of this state for the common safety. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, except as provided in Code Section 22-1-15, neither this state nor any political subdivision thereof nor any other condemning authority shall use eminent domain unless it is for public use. Public use is a matter of law to be determined by the court and the condemnor bears the burden of proof.

         Except as provided in Code Section 22-1-15, if property acquired through the power of eminent domain from an owner fails to be put to a public use within five years, the former property owner may apply to the condemnor or its successor or assign for reconveyance or quitclaim of the property to the former property owner or for additional compensation for such property. For purposes of this subsection, property shall be considered to have been put to a public use at the point in time when substantial good faith effort has been expended on a project to put the property to public use, notwithstanding the fact that the project may not have been completed. The application shall be in writing, and the condemnor or its successor or assign shall act on the application within 60 days by:
         <ol type="A">
          <li id="t22c01s22-1-2ol1c1A">
           Executing a reconveyance or quitclaim of the property upon receipt of compensation not to exceed the amount of the compensation paid by the condemnor at the time of acquisition; or

           Paying additional compensation to the former owner of the property, such compensation to be calculated by subtracting the price paid by the condemnor for the property at the time of acquisition from the fair market value of the property at the time the application is filed.

         If the condemnor fails to take either action within 60 days, the former property owner may, within the next 90 days following, initiate an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located to reacquire the property or receive additional compensation.

       When property is acquired from more than one owner for the same public use and reconveyance or additional compensation to a single owner is impracticable, any party to the original condemnation or each person with a legal claim in such condemnation may file an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located for an equitable resolution.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the power to take private property for a public use or benefit is in derogation of the right of the citizen, statutes under which it is claimed must be strictly construed, and it is generally held that the power is not conferred unless an intention to that effect appears in clear and express terms, or by necessary implication. Botts v. Southeastern Pipe-Line Co., <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 689</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 375</cite> (1940), commented on in, see 3 Ga. B.J. 49 (1941).

       The exercise of the right of eminent domain is a legislative function, and the powers delegated by the General Assembly thereunder must be exercised in strict conformity with the statute.

       - In the absence of bad faith the exercise of the right of eminent domain rests largely in the discretion of the authority exercising such right, both as to necessity and amount. City of Atlanta v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 658</cite>, <cite class="app_court">269 S.E.2d 878</cite> (1980).

       - Where property is condemned for exchange with another public utility, and the property will be used for a public purpose, this is called "substituted condemnation," and this is a valid exercise of the condemnor's power of eminent domain. City of Atlanta v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">144 Ga. App. 157</cite>, <cite class="app_court">240 S.E.2d 730</cite> (1977).

       - Where the Department of Transportation informed a corporation in the spring of 1981 that a building leased by it would be condemned for highway purposes, but later all work on the proposed highway, including all condemnation actions in progress, was halted, and the corporation sought to recover from the department its loss of an advantageous leasehold interest, as well as expenses involved in moving, since the corporation had been advised that no move was required before September 1982, and that written notification would precede a required removal, its decision to move in August 1982 was by voluntary choice, and could not be attributed to an interference by the department with its exclusive rights of ownership, use and enjoyment. Hence, whether the corporation's action was characterized as direct or inverse condemnation, the losses claimed did not result from an exercise of eminent domain. Josh Cabaret, Inc. v. DOT, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 749</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 346</cite> (1987).

       - The taking or injuring of private property for the public benefit is the exercise of a high power, and all the conditions and limitations provided by law, under which it may be done, should be closely followed.

       - A taking of property for which compensation must be first paid does not require an actual physical taking, but may consist in an interference with the rights of ownership, use and enjoyment, or any other right incident to property. Woodside v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 75</cite>, <cite class="app_court">103 S.E.2d 108</cite> (1958).

       In a condemnation case, an arbitrator properly found that the condemnor who refused to assist the owner of the condemned land in relocating its plant located on the condemned land, was responsible for the owner's failure to relocate the plant. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the cost of relocating a plant located on the condemned land exceeded the plant's value, as awarded by an arbitrator, the plant's owner could not be charged with failing to mitigate its damages by not relocating. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).

       <p>
        <p>
       In an eminent domain proceeding, the condemning authority could not object to an arbitrator's consideration of the cost of relocating a plant located on the condemned land because the authority made the cost of relocation a relevant issue by claiming the owner breached its duty to mitigate damages by not relocating the plant. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).

        Market value is not the only criterion for determining just and adequate compensation

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:

       <p>
        <p>

        Loss of future revenue is not a proper measure of damages
       
       in condemnation procedures, but the value of property to the owner for the particular purpose for which he designs to use it can always be shown. Harrison v. Regents of Univ. Sys., <cite class="ga_app_court">105 Ga. App. 817</cite>, <cite class="app_court">125 S.E.2d 793</cite> (1962).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" where fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when they are not of a type generally bought or sold in the open market. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).

        It is not incorrect to instruct jury on lost profits

         Recovery of business losses.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Business losses are recoverable as a separate item only if the property is "unique." DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a business belongs to the landowner, total destruction of the business at the location must be proven before business losses may be recovered as a separate element of compensation. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the business belongs to a separate lessee, the lessee may recover for business losses as an element of compensation separate from the value of the land whether the destruction of his business is total or merely partial, provided only that the loss is not remote or speculative. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a condemnation case, the fact that the owner of the condemned land had ceased the operation of a rendering plant located on the land by the time of trial, did not preclude the recovery of business loss damages. Carroll County Water Auth. v. L.J.S. Grease &amp; Tallow, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 353</cite>, <cite class="app_court">617 S.E.2d 612</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>

       Award of business loss damages was proper for the condemnation of land on which a rendering plant was located because the loss was not speculative: the plant was established, and plants engaged in the rendering business, were not generally bought and sold on the open market, making it unique.

       - Where the Department of Transportation informed a corporation in the spring of 1981 that a building leased by it would be condemned for highway purposes, but later all work on the proposed highway, including all condemnation actions in progress, was halted, and the corporation sought to recover from the department its loss of an advantageous leasehold interest, as well as expenses involved in moving, since the corporation had been advised that no move was required before September 1982, and that written notification would precede a required removal, its decision to move in August 1982, was by voluntary choice, and could not be attributed to an interference by the department with its exclusive rights of ownership, use and enjoyment. Hence, whether the corporation's action was characterized as direct or inverse condemnation, the losses claimed did not result from an exercise of eminent domain. Josh Cabaret, Inc. v. DOT, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 749</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 346</cite> (1987).

       - The taking or injuring of private property for the public benefit is the exercise of a high power, and all the conditions and limitations provided by law, under which it may be done, should be closely followed. Too much caution in this respect cannot be observed to prevent abuse and oppression. Thomas v. City of Cairo, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 336</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 192</cite> (1950).

        <p>
       - Damages, both direct and consequential, which are recoverable are those arising from construction from some visible and physical inference with a specific piece of property, or with some specific right or rise connected therewith and capable of exact description. Austin v. Augusta Term. Ry., <cite class="ga_court">108 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E. 852</cite>, <cite class="lra">47 L.R.A. 755</cite> (1899).

        Measure of damage is value of land taken and consequential damage,
       
       if any, to the remainder of the land. State Hwy. Dep't v. Weldon, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 98</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 396</cite> (1962).

        <p>
       - On a question in regard to the value of land sought to be condemned, it is competent to introduce evidence of sales of property similar to that in question, made at or near the time of the taking. The exact limit either of similarity or difference or of nearness or remoteness in point of time is difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe by any arbitrary rule, but must to a large extent depend on the location and the character of the property and the circumstances of the case; it is to be considered with reference to throwing light on the issue, and not as a mere method of raising a legal puzzle. West v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">95 Ga. App. 320</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 785</cite> (1957).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Failure to secure the property by contract, by reason of the inability of the parties to agree upon the compensation to be paid therefor, is an essential prerequisite to the condemnation of private property for public uses. City of Elberton v. Hobbs, <cite class="ga_court">121 Ga. 750</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E. 780</cite> (1905).

        <p>
       Negotiations by a county authority, procuring right of way for roads in the name of the Department of Transportation (formerly State Highway Department) in an effort to agree with the owner of the property to be taken are not only authorized, but are required. Miller v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 485</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 365</cite> (1946).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the property owners' motion to dismiss the condemnation petition, nor in overruling the owners' exception to the special master's award, because the evidence at the special master hearing showed that the telecommunications condemnor made an effort to agree on a purchase price for the property, but that those negotiations ultimately failed, which was sufficient to show that the condemnor could not procure the property by contract within the meaning of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t22c01s22-1-6" target="_self">22-1-6</a></cite>. White v. Ringgold Tel. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">334 Ga. App. 325</cite>, <cite class="app_court">779 S.E.2d 378</cite> (2015), cert. denied, No. S16C0404, 2016 Ga. LEXIS 148 (Ga. 2016).

        If landowner permits, without legal objection, public utility to appropriate his land

       <p>
        - Ordinarily, when an entire parcel of property is taken, or an entire leasehold interest is taken, the measure of the damages is the "market value" of the land or leasehold interest as the case might be; market value has been defined as the price which may be paid by one wishing but not required to buy, to one wishing but not required to sell. 1958-59 Op.

     <p>
      In order to encourage and expedite the acquisition of real property by agreements with owners, to avoid litigation and relieve congestion in the courts, to assure consistent treatment for property owners, and to promote public confidence in land acquisition practices, all condemnations and potential condemnations shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be guided by the following policies and practices:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol11">
       The condemning authority shall make every reasonable effort to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol12">
       Where the condemning authority seeks to obtain a fee simple interest in real property, real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his or her designated representatives shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his or her inspection of the property, except that the condemning authority may, by law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, prescribe a procedure to waive the appraisal in cases involving the acquisition by sale or donation of property with a low fair market value;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol13">
       Before the initiation of negotiations for fee simple interest for real property, the condemning authority shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. In no event shall such amount be less than the condemning authority's independent appraisal of the fair market value of such property. The condemning authority shall provide the owner of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount it established as just compensation. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated. The condemning authority shall consider alternative sites suggested by the owner of the property as part of the compensation offered;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol14">
       No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the condemning authority pays the agreed purchase price or deposits with the court in accordance with this title, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the condemning authority's appraisal of the fair market value of such property or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for such property;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol15">
       The construction or development of a project for public use shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling or to move his or her business or farm operation without at least 90 days' written notice from the condemning authority of the date by which such move is required;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol16">
       If the condemning authority permits an owner or tenant to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination by the condemning authority on short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol17">
       In no event shall the condemnor act in bad faith in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol18">
       If any legal interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, the condemning authority shall institute formal condemnation proceedings. No condemnor shall intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his or her real property; and
      </li>
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-9ol19">
       A person whose real property is being acquired in accordance with this title may, after the person has been fully informed of his or her right to receive just compensation for such property, donate such property, any part thereof, any legal interest therein, or any compensation paid to a condemning authority, as such person shall determine.

      Only public necessity can justify taking of private property.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - The right of the humblest individual in the enjoyment of his property must be protected. The right to take private property from the owner for public use often works extreme hardship and savors of oppression. Nothing but a public necessity can justify it, and then only in strict conformity with the law. Williams v. City of La Grange, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 241</cite>, <cite class="app_court">98 S.E.2d 617</cite> (1957).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Condemnor chooses its method of procedure,
    
    and it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. The property owner is also bound, although he did not choose the method of procedure. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Amendment of notice of condemnation proceedings is perfectly proper
    
    where its allowance does not adversely and substantially affect the condemnee's rights. Taylor v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">129 Ga. App. 89</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E.2d 701</cite> (1973).

      Condemnor has burden of proving land value and consequential damages.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - The burden of proof to show the value of the land taken and the consequential damages to the remaining property, if any, is on the condemnor. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 590</cite> (1965).

     <b>
      Sole question for assessors or jury is amount of compensation.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Where proceedings are instituted for the purpose of acquiring property for public purposes, the sole question which may be passed upon by the appointed assessors, or by a jury on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid to one whose property is being taken by the condemning authorities. Since the legislature has not expressly provided any method whereby the property owner can contest the question of public necessity or the right of condemnation, the property owner is left without a legal remedy and must resort to an independent action in a court of equity for relief. Williams v. City of La Grange, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 241</cite>, <cite class="app_court">98 S.E.2d 617</cite> (1957); B. &amp; W. Hen Farm, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 830</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E.2d 841</cite> (1966).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    The sole power of the assessors provided by Article 2 of this chapter relates to the value of the property taken and to no other question. City of Carrollton v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 505</cite>, <cite class="app_court">111 S.E.2d 79</cite> (1959).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    In condemnation cases, the sole question for the consideration of the jury, upon an appeal from an award of the assessors or from an award of a special master, is the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee for the property taken under the condemnation proceeding and the amount of damages to the remaining property of the condemnee, if any. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 590</cite> (1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Appeal from award of assessors is de novo investigation,
    
    and the defendant in such proceedings may file an appropriate legal defense thereto. City of Macon v. Ries, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 320</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E. 21</cite> (1934).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    An appeal from the award of assessors in a condemnation proceeding under the provisions of this chapter is a de novo investigation, and the defendant may file appropriate pleadings and defenses therein as in other suits. Georgia Power Co. v. Lightfoot, <cite class="ga_app_court">97 Ga. App. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">103 S.E.2d 99</cite> (1958).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     This chapter does not provide for intervention by any person claiming interest in property,
    
    whether or not such person was served with notice. Mitchell v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 88</cite> (1961).

      Statutory construction where procedural provisions incomplete.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Where wording is taken from a prior statute, or where Article 2 of this chapter fails to be complete within itself, then reference to provisions for proceedings before assessors is permitted to fill in the void. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).

     <b>
      Contesting validity of condemnation proceedings.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Where a property owner participates in proceedings but refuses to take the award of the assessors, and where the property owner acted promptly after the award of the assessors was made by filing his petition in equity, alleging that the condemnor was proceeding illegally and had no right to condemn, and sought to enjoin the entering upon or taking possession of his property, the property owner is not estopped from contesting the validity of the condemnation proceedings. Johnston v. Clayton County Water Auth., <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 39</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1966).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     The Department of Transportation may not condemn municipally owned property
    
    as the legislature has not clearly granted such authority or created a procedure therefore, and as such grant may not be implied from statutory provisions generally establishing a procedure for state agencies to condemn "private property." DOT v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">255 Ga. 124</cite>, <cite class="app_court">337 S.E.2d 327</cite> (1985).

      Condemnation for transportation purposes.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Even though the title to property to be condemned for transportation purposes was not in question, a city could choose to use procedures set forth in this section and, although it could have done so, was not required to use the procedures set forth in this chapter. Back v. City of Warner Robins, <cite class="ga_app_court">217 Ga. App. 326</cite>, <cite class="app_court">457 S.E.2d 582</cite> (1995).

    - Where a property owner participates in proceedings but refuses to take the award of the assessors, and where the property owner acted promptly after the award of the assessors was made by filing his petition in equity, alleging that the condemnor was proceeding illegally and had no right to condemn, and sought to enjoin the entering upon or taking possession of his property, the property owner is not estopped from contesting the validity of the condemnation proceedings.

         Owner entitled to compensation for land taken and for damage to remaining land.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When a county, in the exercise of its corporate powers, appropriates land of an individual, and as a result the premises of the owner are rendered less valuable, he is entitled to just compensation for the land so taken, and also for the injury thus sustained. Terrell County v. York, <cite class="ga_court">127 Ga. 166</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E. 309</cite> (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In condemnation proceedings the condemnor is liable not only for direct damages for the actual land taken for the public use, but in addition thereto for all consequential damages which naturally and proximately flow from the taking of the land to the remainder of the parcel or tract of land not taken as tend to diminish its market value. Georgia Power Co. v. McCrea, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 542</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There are only two elements of damages to be considered in a condemnation proceeding: first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of it to the purposes for which it is condemned. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Law allows damages to property not actually appropriated

       - Where property is taken under power of eminent domain for a public use, its market value for all purposes for which the property is available is the true measure of the owner's compensation, the value of the property to the condemnor for the specific purpose for which the property is taken is not the basis for measuring the amount of compensation payable to the owner.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Market value of property is what it will bring when sold for cash by a person ready and willing to sell, but under no obligation to sell, and when bought by a person ready and willing to buy, but under no obligation to buy. Housing Auth. v. Spink, <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 72</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 80</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:
       
       replacement cost new less depreciation, income, and comparable sales. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Lost profits may be used as means of awarding just and adequate compensation
       
       because the income approach necessarily takes into account what future earnings would be were the property interest not extinguished. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Improvements on land are proper subjects for independent valuation
       
       in consideration of the just and adequate compensation for the total property taken. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).

McDaniel Enters., Inc. v. Gwinnett County, <cite class="ga_app_court">162 Ga. App. 419</cite>, <cite class="app_court">291 S.E.2d 738</cite> (1982).

       - Privacy afforded by location of realty, like a mountaintop, riverfront or oceanfront location, can also be a factor in determining market value of such realty. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1983).

        A panoramic or scenic view afforded by certain realty

        Condemnee can recover compensation for loss of use of his property during period of construction
       
       by the county, based on its rental value during that time, if the jury first finds that a loss of use had occurred and that the condemnee had taken reasonable steps to avoid such loss. DeKalb County v. Cowan, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 753</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 478</cite> (1979).

        Ascertaining value of land taken by subtracting value of land remaining from value of whole land before taking is error,

       - Trial court did not err in denying motion to strike the testimony of condemnee's expert witness that the condemned property's highest and best use would be as a convenience store because of the property's location in relation to nearby industry and residential development, where the testimony was based on relevant facts concerning existing local population and industry.

       - Although charge restricting jury, in determining value of property, to uses which may be lawfully made of it at time of taking as set out in zoning ordinances then in effect was incorrect, there was no harm since the condemned property was zoned for industrial use at the time of taking and appellant contended that the property's highest and best use was industrial. McDaniel Enters., Inc. v. Gwinnett County, <cite class="ga_app_court">162 Ga. App. 419</cite>, <cite class="app_court">291 S.E.2d 738</cite> (1982).

       Instruction that the mere possibility that land might be used for a certain purpose is not enough to authorize a jury to consider the effect of such a possibility in determining the value of land.

       <p>
        <p>
       The test is whether the land is legitimately usable for other purposes, not whether such use is certain. Possible future uses will not influence the present market value of a tract unless there is a demand for such uses or they are otherwise reasonably probable. Georgia Power Co. v. Cole, <cite class="ga_app_court">141 Ga. App. 806</cite>, <cite class="app_court">234 S.E.2d 382</cite> (1977).

       - Unique property is simply property which must be valued by something other than the fair market value standard because there is no general market for such property. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Unique value is pecuniary value of certain property to its present owner,
       
       in a situation where he can find no other property equally well suited to his use, and there is no taker on the open market at the pecuniary value of the property to him. In such a case there is no market value, which presupposes a willing-buyer willing-seller situation. Housing Auth. v. Troncalli, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" such that fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when they are not of a type generally bought or sold in the open market.

       - Neither "privacy," which is inherent in ownership of all property, nor the fact that the condemned land was "riverfront" property, would authorize a charge on the condemned property having a value "peculiar" to the owner, or that the realty was "unique."

       - The measure of the condemnee's recovery is the fair market value of the property taken, and a condemnee can only recover for the value that the property has to him over and above fair market value in such cases where the evidence shows that the property had some unique and special economic, not merely sentimental, value to the condemnee alone.

       On a question of the value of land sought to be condemned, it is competent to introduce evidence of sales of property similar to that in question, made at or near the time of the taking. The exact limit either of similarity or difference, or of nearness or remoteness in point of time is difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe by any arbitrary rule, but must to a large extent depend on the location and the character of the property and the circumstances of the case.

       <p>

       - The introduction of evidence of particular sales is permitted after such evidence has been qualified by evidence of the similarity of the comparable property with the property being condemned or taken. After the introduction of such preliminary evidence of similarity, the trial judge must determine whether the comparable property is sufficiently similar or nearly like the property being condemned, and whether the time and manner of the particular sale are truly illustrative of the value of the property being condemned. Fulton County v. Cox, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 840</cite> (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Generally, evidence of sales of property similar to that in question made at or near the time of the taking is competent evidence and may be considered to throw light on the issue of the value of the property sought to be condemned; however, the determination as to whether or not the witness testified as to comparable properties similar to that in question is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Oglethorpe Power Corp. v. Seasholtz, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 723</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 429</cite> (1981).

       Where an offer to purchase excludes on its face the property to be taken and thus constitutes merely an offer to purchase the remainder, and another offer, while it includes the property to be taken, appears to be nothing more than a mere oral expression of willingness to purchase, unaccompanied by any proposed terms, any indication of ability to perform, or anything else which might indicate that it was a serious and bona fide offer, such "offers" are too susceptible of fabrication to be allowed into evidence even as a partial basis of opinion testimony.

      The question of consequential damages involves the consideration of the value of the remaining land before the taking and its value after the taking and a determination of whether or not there was a difference in the value before and after the taking.

       - Where a tract of land having a value and a peculiar utility as an entirety is affected by public work, the owner of the land, for the purpose of recovering damages resulting from the performance of the work, cannot sever from the entire tract a portion of it which has been peculiarly damaged and recover damages without reference to the benefits accruing to the entire tract by virtue of the performance of the work.

       - Where, due to a mistake of fact unmixed with negligence, the condemnation proceeding for a public road was conducted throughout upon the theory that the road would be paved at approximately grade level, thus improving rather than damaging the remaining abutting property, and there was nothing to indicate that a fill of from 25 to 40 feet would be made in front of the remaining property which would damage it in the amount of approximately $20,000.00, a petition in equity, alleging these facts and alleging that the mistake prevented the owners from proving this consequential damage, alleged a cause of action to set aside the award and the judgment of condemnation and to recover the full damages.

         Measure of damages for property taken is pecuniary loss to owner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - The measure of damages for property taken by the right of eminent domain, being compensatory in its nature, is the pecuniary loss sustained by the owner, taking into consideration all relevant factors; ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.

         And is ordinarily measured by market value.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Ordinarily, when an entire parcel of property is taken, or an entire leasehold interest is taken, the measure of the damages is the "market value" of the land or leasehold interest as the case might be; market value has been defined as the price which may be paid by one wishing but not required to buy, to one wishing but not required to sell. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 271.

         Assessment of consequential damages.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - In assessing consequential damages, the difference would lie in the valuation of the land which remains after condemnation, as compared with the value of that fragment of land before the condemnation was commenced; in considering this "damage," the assessors or jury would be bound to deduct from the whole damage, any increase which might result from the improvement respecting the sales value or market value of the tract not taken. 1958-59 Op.

         Payment of taxes on land taken by eminent domain.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - The payment of city or county taxes is not a proper element of damages in a condemnation case; the payment of property taxes is a responsibility of the landowner only so long as he, in fact, owns the property. The property owner or condemnee would be responsible for payment of taxes up to the date of taking; after that time, the responsibility for the payment of these taxes would lie upon the condemning body, if in fact that body is an entity which would have the responsibility for payment of these taxes. 1969 Op.

        - The cost of moving personal property from real estate which is taken for public purposes cannot be considered as an element of damage, as such; however, the cost of removal of either fixtures, buildings, or personalty, especially when used for business purposes, may be considered as one of the factors entering into a determination of the value of the real estate to the condemnee from whom it is taken. 1958-59 Op.

        - The cost of moving personal property may in many instances, be evidential as to, or illustrative of, the damage done to such personal property by the taking; such damage must be paid by the authority which so takes it for public purposes. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 276.

        i.e., a portion of the building lies on land which is taken, and a portion of the building lies on land which is not taken, that portion of the building which extends upon the right of way may be severed if it is practicable to do so without destruction of the building; if severance would result in destruction, then the measure of damage to the building is its full value. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.
       </p>
       <p>
        In circumstances where a condemnation causes the intersection of a building by the line drawn between the land taken and the land not taken, where it is impossible to sever the building and the whole building would be destroyed, the value of the land without the building taken would be charged against the condemnor; the true market value of the remaining portion of the condemnee's land without the building, of course, it being destroyed, would be compared with the value of that tract before taking. 1958-59 Op.

       - The word "damaged," has a broader meaning than the word "taken," and is designed to impose liability on a condemnor for consequential injuries to property which would not otherwise exist. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1983).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In condemnation proceedings the condemnor is liable not only for direct damages for the actual land taken for the public use, but in addition thereto for all consequential damages which naturally and proximately flow from the taking of the land to the remainder of the parcel or tract of land not taken as tend to diminish its market value. Georgia Power Co. v. McCrea, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 542</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There are two elements to be considered in connection with the damages in condemnation cases, the actual value of the land taken and the consequential damage or consequential benefit to the remaining land. Fulton County v. Power, <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 783</cite>, <cite class="app_court">137 S.E.2d 474</cite> (1964).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In an eminent domain proceeding, the "just and adequate compensation" due a condemnee is "the value" of the land taken, plus any consequential damages to the remainder if there is a partial taking, which may not be less than "the actual value" of the property taken or damaged. Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1983).

       <p>
        <p>

        Law allows damages to property not actually appropriated
       
       in an eminent domain proceeding as consequential damages if such damages are shown. Justice v. State Hwy. Dept., <cite class="ga_app_court">100 Ga. App. 794</cite>, <cite class="app_court">112 S.E.2d 307</cite> (1959).

        <p>
       - Consequential damages to property not taken in a condemnation proceeding resulting from the proper construction and maintenance of the object for which the property is taken must be recovered, if recovered at all, in the condemnation proceeding. State Hwy. Dep't v. Kaylor, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 46</cite>, <cite class="app_court">137 S.E.2d 664</cite> (1964).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In any eminent domain case the evidence and instructions to the jury should be such that they are enabled to figure separately the value of the land or interest therein which is taken and the consequential damages to the land not taken, the latter of course balanced against any consequential benefits and by adding the two figures return a lump sum verdict which includes both items of depreciated value to the landowner. Georgia Power Co. v. Sinclair, <cite class="ga_app_court">122 Ga. App. 305</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E.2d 639</cite> (1970).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The question of the value of the land taken and condemned and the amount of consequential damages to be assessed against the condemnor for the remaining land are matters of opinion. Derrick v. Rabun County, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 583</cite> (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Measure of damages for property taken is pecuniary loss sustained by owner,
       
       taking into consideration all relevant factors. Ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be the fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. Housing Auth. v. Savannah Iron &amp; Wire Works, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 881</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E.2d 671</cite> (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Assessment of compensation covers all damages which result from proper construction,
       
       whether those damages are foreseen or not. Whipple v. County of Houston, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 532</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1958).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where the public authorities properly erected and properly maintain the improvements authorized by law, the only right of action which is maintainable is that conferred by state constitutional provision; it does not sound in tort, and the recovery permitted is strictly limited to the direct damage inflicted by diminishing the market value of the property damaged, as measured by the difference in its market value before and immediately after the construction of the public works, excluding all consequential damages subsequently accruing, such as might be recoverable in an action sounding in tort, based on the maintenance of a continuing, abatable nuisance. Felton v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 930</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 506</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It cannot be assumed in condemnation proceedings that there will be negligent construction
       
       or operation of the project so as to cause damage in excess of that which would naturally and proximately result from the construction and operation thereof. McCrea v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 276</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 540</cite> (1933).

       <p>
        <p>
       - The mere contiguity of several parcels of land belonging to one owner does not in itself render the lots in the aggregate an entire tract. Gaines v. City of Calhoun, <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 89</cite>, <cite class="app_court">155 S.E. 214</cite> (1930).

       - The mere platting of a tract of land and its subdivision into vacant building lots does not necessarily destroy the oneness or unity of the entire property. Gaines v. City of Calhoun, <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 89</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E. 214</cite> (1930).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - It is not necessary to the validity of an assessment in a condemnation proceeding that all three of the assessors agree upon a valuation. A majority is sufficient. Cable v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 593</cite>, <cite class="app_court">68 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Assessment made by two assessors in absence of third cannot be collaterally attacked
       
       in a suit for injunction. If the assessment is irregular or erroneous, it must be vacated and set aside in a direct attack upon the award. Cable v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 593</cite>, <cite class="app_court">68 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1952).
       </p>

        <p>

        In a proceeding to condemn only a portion of a tract of land
       
       the only question to be determined by the jury is the amount which the condemnor should pay as just and adequate compensation for the part taken and consequential damages, if any, to the remaining portion of the tract, as such damages may be offset, but not exceeded, by consequential benefits. Alabama Power Co. v. Chandler, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 550</cite>, <cite class="app_court">123 S.E.2d 767</cite> (1962).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where a street upon which a lot abuts is closed by an obstruction at an intersecting street, which, as respects the lot, makes the street upon which it abuts a cul-de-sac, although the obstruction is neither immediately in front of the lot nor touches the lot, and the obstruction thereby materially diminishes and curtails the right of the owner to the free and uninterrupted use of the street in front of the lot, as a means of access to and from different parts of the city, it constitutes a special damage to the lot, different in kind from that inflicted upon the community in general, and the owner has a right of action in damages therefor. Felton v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 930</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 506</cite> (1935).

       - Where land is condemned for use as a new limited access highway the condemnee is not entitled to damages, actual or consequential, for lack of access to said new highway by reason of any rights of easement for ingress and egress to and from said highway.

        "Value," as used in reference to land taken under eminent domain,
       
       is a relative term depending on the circumstances. Thus, under some circumstances, "the value" might be the actual value, the market value, the salable value, the reasonable value, and the cash value. State Hwy. Bd. v. Bridges, <cite class="ga_app_court">60 Ga. App. 240</cite>, <cite class="app_court">3 S.E.2d 907</cite> (1939).

       It was not reversible error to charge the jury that "value," which is qualified in this section as "actual value," is the fair and reasonable value of a strip of land actually taken.

        Ascertaining value of land taken by subtracting value of land remaining from value of whole land before taking is error,
       
       since this permits the consideration of consequential damages or benefits in arriving at the value of the land remaining and may thus work harm to either the condemnor or the condemnee.

       Measure of consequential damages to adjoining property

         Assessment of consequential damages.

       <p>
        - In assessing consequential damages, the difference would lie in the valuation of the land which remains after condemnation, as compared with the value of that fragment of land before the condemnation was commenced; in considering this "damage," the assessors or jury would be bound to deduct from the whole damage, any increase which might result from the improvement respecting the sales value or market value of the tract not taken. 1958-59 Op.

         Payment of taxes on land taken by eminent domain.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - The payment of city or county taxes is not a proper element of damages in a condemnation case; the payment of property taxes is a responsibility of the landowner only so long as he, in fact, owns the property. The property owner or condemnee would be responsible for payment of taxes up to the date of taking; after that time, the responsibility for the payment of these taxes would lie upon the condemning body, if in fact that body is an entity which would have the responsibility for payment of these taxes. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-494.

         Cost of transferring personal business articles to new location cannot be charged as such,

        but the reasonable cost of such moving may be evidence which is illustrative of the damage to the property, measured as of that particular owner; therefore, the cost of such moving should be ascertained and estimated, either when arriving at a value for negotiation, or when determining evidence of a value in condemnation case. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 276.

         Where area taken for right of way intersects building on tract involved,

        i.e., a portion of the building lies on land which is taken, and a portion of the building lies on land which is not taken, that portion of the building which extends upon the right of way may be severed if it is practicable to do so without destruction of the building; if severance would result in destruction, then the measure of damage to the building is its full value. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.
       </p>
       <p>
        In circumstances where a condemnation causes the intersection of a building by the line drawn between the land taken and the land not taken, where it is impossible to sever the building and the whole building would be destroyed, the value of the land without the building taken would be charged against the condemnor; the true market value of the remaining portion of the condemnee's land without the building, of course, it being destroyed, would be compared with the value of that tract before taking. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 273.

        <p>
       - The burden of proof to show the value of the land taken and the consequential damages to the remaining property, if any, is on the condemnor. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 590</cite> (1965).

        Condemnor chooses its method of procedure,
       
       and it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. The property owner is also bound, although he did not choose the method of procedure. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).

       - An award of compensation by assessors, filed as required by law, is a taking of private property for public use and payment must be made as a condition precedent to the condemnor's right to prosecute an appeal.

        <p>
       - In condemnation cases, the sole question for the consideration of the jury, upon an appeal from an award of the assessors or from an award of a special master, is the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee for the property taken under the condemnation proceeding and the amount of damages to the remaining property of the condemnee, if any.

        Motion to dismiss appeal in condemnation proceedings
       
       under Art. 3 of this chapter, which is regulated by this part, falls in a different category from an oral motion to strike pleadings, amendments, or answers, since the motion to dismiss the appeal raises issues of fact. Murray v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">120 S.E.2d 48</cite> (1961).

        <p>
       - Where a property owner participates in proceedings but refuses to take the award of the assessors, and where the property owner acted promptly after the award of the assessors was made by filing his petition in equity, alleging that the condemnor was proceeding illegally and had no right to condemn, and sought to enjoin the entering upon or taking possession of his property, the property owner is not estopped from contesting the validity of the condemnation proceedings.

     <p>
      In case either party is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessors' award, he or they may, within ten days from the time the award is filed, enter in writing an appeal from the award to the superior court of the county where the award is filed. At the term succeeding the filing of the appeal, it shall be the duty of the judge to cause an issue to be made and tried by a jury as to the value of the property or interest taken or the amount of damage done, with the same right to move for a new trial and file an appeal as in other cases at law.
     </p>

       The Legislature intended to concern itself with time after which appeal may not be filed,
      
      with no regard to the time when filing is premature, except that of course the award of the assessors must be in existence, and the rights of the parties fixed, in order that there may be something to appeal from. The filing itself is not essential to the validity but only to the enforceability of the award. Hodges v. South Ga. Natural Gas Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 180</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Award of assessors, standing alone, is not judgment of court
      
      since the judgment is entered up by the court based on the award, but it is a judgment rendered by a tribunal which is competent to fix the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings with reference to the matters and things involved. It can be amended only by permission of the court. Hodges v. South Ga. Natural Gas Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 180</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 182</cite> (1965).

        <p>
       - Since the Board of Assessors did not file and record their award, apparently on the belief that the parties had decided on their own what the just compensation was for the condemnor obtaining the right of way, the 10-day time period for filing an appeal to a jury from the time the award was filed never arose and the condemnee was not barred from filing an appeal to a jury.

       An appeal to the superior court from an award of assessors in a condemnation proceeding is a de novo investigation, if the assessors had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. If the assessors do have such jurisdiction, the appeal will not be dismissed nor the case remanded, though the award be in fact a nullity. Livsey v. Walton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga.

       An appeal from an award of assessors is a trial de novo on the question of compensation, and it is the function and duty of the jury to pass upon the issues independently of the award of the assessors.

        <p>
       The only method of correcting any errors the assessors or a special master may have made in the original hearing and award is not by recommittal to that body but by an appeal in the superior court, which begins again the process of adjudication.

        <p>
       - The issue on appeal cannot be broadened so as to raise questions other than those as to compensation. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., <cite class="ga_court">120 Ga. 268</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E. 15</cite>, 1 Ann. Cas. 734 (1904); Atlanta Terra Cotta Co. v. Georgia Ry. &amp; Elec.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In condemnation proceedings the only issue before the assessors or a jury on appeal is the amount of compensation to be paid, and neither the assessors nor a jury can determine whether the condemnor is proceeding legally; the remedy of the landowners is to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the illegal proceedings. Garden Parks v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 31</cite> (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The sole question to be passed upon by the assessors, or a jury in the superior court on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid. Whether the quantity of land sought to be taken is necessary and proper for the purpose for which it is sought is a question not involved in such a proceeding. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>

       As a general rule the only issue before the jury relative to lands taken is its market value at the time of the taking. State Hwy. Dep't v. Howell, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 606</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 213</cite> (1969).

       <p>
        <p>
       While all relevant legal and equitable issues may be raised in an appeal from the assessors' award in a condemnation proceeding, the sole issue for the jury is value. All other issues, including the necessary fact finding, are for the determination of the court. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An appeal to the superior court jury is on the issue of value and damages alone. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 63</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 304</cite> (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An appeal from an award of assessors is a trial de novo on the question of compensation, and it is the function and duty of the jury to pass upon the issues independently of the award of the assessors. DeKalb County v. Queen, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 624</cite> (1975).

        Appeal from award of arbitrators governed by
       
       Title 9. - Notwithstanding a provision in an agreement submitting issues to arbitration under Title 9, that the arbitrators should proceed "as in condemnation proceedings," and providing for an "appeal" from the award to the superior court, the award of the arbitrators was a statutory award, to be governed by Title 9, not this title. Georgia Power Co. v. Friar, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga.

        Condemnee should be allowed to show rental income from property,

      The tender, payment, or acceptance of the award shall not prevent either party from prosecuting the appeal. If the amount awarded by the assessors is less than that found by the final judgment, the person seeking condemnation shall be bound to pay the sum so finally adjudged in order to retain the property or interest. If the amount of the final judgment is less than that awarded by the assessors, the owner shall be bound to refund any excess paid to or received by him; and a judgment for such excess shall be rendered against him to be collected by levy as in other cases.

       - Under the mandate of the Constitution, that private property cannot be taken or damaged for public use without first paying just and adequate compensation to the owner, the payment of the amount of a jury verdict in excess of the prior appraisal by assessors, or special master, is a condition precedent to a valid appeal from such verdict and the judgment based thereon.

       - Although the condemnor tendered compensation into the trial court's registry that appeared to represent the sum the condemnor and condemnee had agreed was sufficient compensation, the tender of the award did not affect the condemnee's right to appeal to a jury.

       - Where the condemnor paid into the registry of the court the sum awarded to the condemnee by the appointed assessors, and the court paid the sum to the condemnee, the condemnor appealed from the assessors' award, and the court entered judgment for the condemnor for the difference between the assessors' award and the jury's verdict, the award of interest at 7 percent per annum from the date the condemnee withdrew the award from the court was improper.

       - The filing of a suit by a condemnee independently of condemnation proceedings and subsequently to the award of the appraisers, in which latter case the condemnee sought to obtain a general judgment for damages, did not affect the right of the condemnee to proceed to have an execution issued on the award in the manner prescribed by this section.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.09.html#t09c02s9-2-44ol1a" target="_blank">9-2-44(a)</a></cite>, have been pleaded to the subsequent damage suit, since the obtaining of the valid award of the appraisers, which award was in the nature of a judgment, prevented a further suit on the same cause of action, except such proceeding as was necessary to enforce the award. The award and the proceedings to enforce it were exhaustive of the condemnee's rights in the premises, and no legal judgment could have been rendered in the same. Towler v. State Hwy.

       Requirement of payment of costs is for benefit of officers of court

       Clerk is not bound to receive appeal until costs have been paid to him,
      
      but if the clerk does receive an appeal without exacting the costs, the appeal is good, and the clerk becomes estopped from saying that the costs have not been paid to him - estopped as to all persons, at least, except the appellant.

    The 1967 amendment to this article should be construed as evidencing legislative intent that special master proceeding be considered a "supplementary" and "cumulative" form of condemnation in all cases wherein condemnor otherwise possesses power of eminent domain.

      Procedure not available for taking property previously dedicated to public use.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - In absence of express authority, the condemning procedure authorized by this article is not available for use by condemnors who seek to take property previously dedicated to a public use. Georgia S. &amp; Fla. Ry. v. City of Warner Robins, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 370</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 151</cite> (1963).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Condemnor chooses its method of procedure,
    
    and it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. The property owner is also bound, although he did not choose the method of procedure. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    If the condemnor elects to use the Special Master Law, then it is bound by the provisions of law following its own election. Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 919</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite> (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Condemnor has no rights except those expressly granted to it by statute,
    
    and those rights can be exercised only when every prerequisite to their exercise has been fully met. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Large discretion is vested in condemnor in selection of property to be condemned,
    
    and such selection should not be interfered with or controlled by the courts, unless made in bad faith, or capriciously or wantonly injurious, or in some respect beyond the privilege conferred by statute or its charter.

    - When legal objections are raised before and passed upon by the special master, to obtain review of these objections exceptions must be taken to the master's findings prior to the superior court's entry of an order and judgment condemning the property; additionally, if either party is dissatisfied with the master's award as regards value, they may, within ten days from the time the award is filed, enter in writing an appeal from the award to the superior court and it shall be the duty of the judge to cause an issue to be made and tried by a jury.

     <p>

     This article limits appeal to question of value only,
    
    and provides that all other issues including the right to condemn, the interest condemned, and everything else preliminary to the actual vesting of title should be decided at the first hearing. Johnson v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 54</cite> (1961); Brown v. Georgia Power Co., 371 F. Supp. 543 (S.D.

    In condemnation cases, the sole question for the consideration of the jury, upon an appeal from an award of the assessors or from an award of a special master, is the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee for the property taken under the condemnation proceeding and the amount of damages to the remaining property of the condemnee, if any. State Hwy. Dep't v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 292</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 590</cite> (1965).

     Appellate review of question of what property interest is taken

       - Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover.

       Condemnation of a property owner's land by a city was upheld on appeal, as was the trial court's judgment entered upon a jury verdict in the amount of $63,361 for the property and an award of attorney fees to the city, because the property owner never challenged the valuation made by a special master and also removed the amount awarded from the registry, thereby estopping the owner from challenging the legality of the taking on appeal.

      This article shall be supplementary to and cumulative of the methods of condemnation described in Articles 1 and 3 of this chapter in cases in which the state, or any branch of the government of the state, or any county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state, or any housing authority, or any other person possessing the power of eminent domain is concerned. This article is intended to provide a simpler and more effective method of condemnation in those cases where a judicial supervision of the proceedings is desirable by reason of the necessity for a quick determination of the just and adequate compensation to be paid the owner of the property or interest subject to be condemned, or by reason of the number of parties at interest or the conflicting interests of such parties, or in cases where there are parties who are non compos mentis or who are not sui juris or who are nonresidents, or in cases where there are conflicting interests or doubtful questions. In all particulars not otherwise specially provided for in this article, the court shall conform its procedure as nearly as possible to Articles 1 and 3 of this chapter.

       Purpose of this article
      
      is to provide an effective method of condemnation where judicial supervision of the procedure is desirable. Golfland, Inc. v. Thomas, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 563</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 757</cite> (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The primary purpose of special master proceeding under this article is to secure a quick determination of the compensation to be paid. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 63</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 304</cite> (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The special master method of condemnation is intended to be an expeditious method of arriving at a just and adequate compensation to be paid a citizen before his interest in property may be condemned. Such is accomplished by having a special master appointed to hear evidence as to the value of the property taken and damage done and then to make an award upon which the superior court can enter a judgment immediately vesting title in the condemnor upon payment of the amount awarded. Shoemaker v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 573</cite>, <cite class="app_court">241 S.E.2d 820</cite> (1978).

       - The special master method of condemnation is intended to be an expeditious method of arriving at the just and adequate compensation to be paid a citizen before his interest in property may be condemned; allowing a condemnee to raise, for the first time on appeal from the special master's award, the right of the condemnor to take the property sought to be condemned, would obstruct this purpose.

       - "Private property" does not include property owned by a government or a governmental entity. DOT v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">255 Ga. 124</cite>, <cite class="app_court">337 S.E.2d 327</cite> (1985).

       <p>
        <p>

        The Department of Transportation may not condemn municipally owned property
       
       as the legislature has not clearly granted such authority or created a procedure therefore, and as such grant may not be implied from statutory provisions generally establishing a procedure for state agencies to condemn "private property." DOT v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">255 Ga. 124</cite>, <cite class="app_court">337 S.E.2d 327</cite> (1985).

        Condemnation by special master is expeditious method of arriving at just and adequate compensation
       
       to be paid a citizen before his interest in property may be condemned. Such is accomplished by having a special master appointed to hear evidence as to the value of the property taken and the damage done and then to make an award upon which the superior court can enter a judgment immediately vesting title in the condemnor upon payment of the amount awarded. Shoemaker v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 573</cite>, <cite class="app_court">241 S.E.2d 820</cite> (1978); Allen v. Hall County, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        All legal issues relating to condemnation may be raised and determined in special master proceeding.
       
       If no exceptions are taken to the master's findings or no regular appeal taken from the judgment based on his award, the only issue remaining is that of value. Allen v. Hall County, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 629</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 713</cite> (1980).

       - Though the primary duty of the special master is to ascertain the value of the property sought to be condemned, the special master is authorized to hear and determine any legal objections that may be raised by the parties, including, the right of the condemnor to condemn, the interest, the nature of the interest taken and the effect of the condemnation upon the respective rights of the parties.

         Judicial review of master's findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - If the special master makes findings not only as to just and adequate compensation for the property taken but also as to other matters material to the condemnee's respective rights, the proper method for the condemnee to obtain judicial review of the special master's findings in regard to matters other than the just and adequate compensation for the property taken is to file objections to the special master's award prior to the court entering an order and making the award a judgment of the court. Georgia Power Co. v. Baggarley, <cite class="ga_app_court">133 Ga. App. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">211 S.E.2d 23</cite> (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When legal objections are raised before and passed upon by the special master, to obtain review of these objections exceptions must be taken to the master's findings prior to the superior court's entry of an order and judgment condemning the property. If no exceptions are taken and the master's findings are made the judgment of the court, the court's judgment is final insofar as it adjudicates these legal issues, until set aside or reversed in a manner provided by law. Allen v. Hall County, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 629</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 713</cite> (1980).

       - Having chosen and agreed to use the special master proceeding, a condemnee is bound by the applicable law regarding the special master's proceeding.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Objections or exceptions must be specific.
       
       Litigants have a responsibility to make their timely objections or exceptions to the award of the special master in specific rather than in generalized form. Beck v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">180 Ga. App. 808</cite>, <cite class="app_court">350 S.E.2d 818</cite> (1986).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The failure of a party to file exceptions to the master's award for determination by the superior court results in a waiver of the party's right to further litigate any nonvalue issues. Beck v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">180 Ga. App. 808</cite>, <cite class="app_court">350 S.E.2d 818</cite> (1986).

        Condemnation award and judgment, unexcepted to and unappealed from, is res judicata
       
       as to the issue of the existence and length of any leasehold interest. Therefore, the judgment in the condemnation proceeding is conclusive to all nonvalue issues raised on appeal. Allen v.

       - The condemnor's description of the right of way sought to be condemned was sufficiently definite when the petition (a) described with certainty the entire tract of land through which the right of way was to pass, (b) described the right of way in metes, bounds and distances, (c) described minutely the proposed construction of poles, lines, etc., for the transmission of electric current, and (d) included a plat showing the property sought to be condemned.

        <p>
       - Trial court did not err in denying the property owners' motion to dismiss the condemnation petition, nor in overruling their exception to the special master's award, because the evidence at the special master hearing showed that the telecommunications condemnor made an effort to agree on a purchase price for the property, but that those negotiations ultimately failed, which was sufficient to show that it could not procure the property by contract within the meaning of O.C.G.A.

       - Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover.

      The special master appointed pursuant to Code Section 22-2-103 shall serve in lieu of a board of assessors; provided, however, that if two assessors are selected pursuant to Code Section 22-2-108.1, the special master shall serve as the chairperson of the special master panel and shall decide all issues other than value issues which arise at the hearing provided for in Code Section 22-2-102. The special master's duties and authority, except as otherwise provided for in this article, shall be the same as provided by Code Sections 22-2-61 through 22-2-63. The special master shall hold the hearing provided for in Code Section 22-2-102 at the time and place provided by the order of the judge of the superior court and in compliance with the duties and authority conferred by this article. The special master shall not be authorized to continue or delay the hearing, except as otherwise provided by Code Section 22-2-108.1, relating to granting of a recess for selection of assessors, or by Code Section 9-10-150, relating to granting continuances by reason of membership in the General Assembly during sessions thereof, or except upon the written order of the judge of the superior court; and such a continuance shall be granted only for good cause shown to that judge. When it shall be necessary for the judge to grant a continuance, the continuance shall be for not more than five days from the date of the order granting the continuance.

Leach v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_court">228 Ga. 16</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E.2d 755</cite> (1971); Ward v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga.

       - This Code section mandates that no continuance be granted in excess of five days and does not denominate one rule for condemnors and another rule for condemnees, so where the condemnor failed to abide by the clear language of the statutory method it elected to follow, and the record was clear that condemnees at no time acquiesced in or waived strict compliance with this Code section, the trial court erred by not declaring the hearing of the special master void for violation of this Code section. Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">367 S.E.2d 817</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga.

       - It was error to hold that the date of taking property to acquire an easement for electrical transmission and distribution lines was the date of filing of the original condemnation petition; because the property was not being condemned for public street and road purposes, the date of taking was not governed by O.C.G.A.

        There are only two elements of damages to be considered in condemnation proceeding:
       
       first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of it to the purposes for which it is condemned. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Anything that actually enhances value of land must be considered
       
       in order to meet the constitutional demand that the owner be paid before the taking, adequate and just compensation. DOT v. Arnold, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 502</cite>, <cite class="app_court">268 S.E.2d 775</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:
       
       replacement cost new less depreciation, income, and comparable sales. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).

        Measure of consequential damages
       
       if any, to the property which the condemnee retains, is the market value of the remainder in its circumstances just prior to the time of the taking, as compared with its market value in its new circumstances just after the time of the taking.

       The only relevant inquiry in an appeal from the amount awarded by the special master was the overall value of the property condemned pursuant to this Article, with the fact that the property contained "chewacla" soil being taken into account; the trial court did not err in excluding irrelevant testimony as to the separate value of the "chewacla" soil located on the property.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" such that fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when they are not of a type generally bought or sold in the open market. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a business belongs to the landowner, total destruction of the business at the location must be proven before business losses may be recovered as a separate element of compensation. DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).

       - Market value of property taken by the Department of Transportation is a matter of opinion, and may be established by direct as well as circumstantial evidence; it is peculiarly a matter for the jury, and the jury is not absolutely bound even by uncontradicted testimony of experts, but may consider the nature of the property involved, together with any other fact or circumstance properly within the knowledge of the jury which tends to establish the value of the property, and may arrive at a different figure than that of the experts, higher or lower, where the verdict reached is not so disparate as to justify an inference of gross mistake or undue bias.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When an expert witness testifies as to the value of property in a condemnation case, and the examination of the witness discloses that his examination of the property had been made both before and after the date of taking, this does not prevent his testimony from having probative value as to the date of taking where the witness testifies as to his familiarity with the property as of the date of taking.

        It was not error to fail to charge on consequential benefits

       - Condemnation proceeding was not voided and nullified by the fact that special master's award was not filed with clerk of court within three days after date of hearing, since the requirement of speedy disposition to protect the property owner is directory rather than jurisdictional. Savage v. Thomaston-Upson County Office Bldg. Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">205 Ga.

       - It was error to hold that the date of taking property to acquire an easement for electrical transmission and distribution lines was the date of filing of the original condemnation petition; because the property was not being condemned for public street and road purposes, the date of taking was not governed by O.C.G.A.

       On appeal from a special master's award, the court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on non-value issues because that would allow new evidence which was not before the special master or a repetition of evidence which should have been preserved by transcript.

       It was error to hold that the date of taking property to acquire an easement for electrical transmission and distribution lines was the date of filing of the original condemnation petition; because the property was not being condemned for public street and road purposes, the date of taking was not governed by O.C.G.A.

       - The only method of correcting any errors the assessors or a special master may have made in the original hearing and award is not by recommittal to that body but by an appeal in the superior court, which begins again the process of adjudication. City of Savannah Beach v. Thompson, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 63</cite>, <cite class="app_court">217 S.E.2d 304</cite> (1975); Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">186 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If an appeal is taken by any party to a jury pursuant to this section, the trial judge commits error in remanding the case to the special master. The trial judge should rule on all legal issues, either by pretrial order or during the course of the trial, in the jury case pending before him. Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">237 Ga. 358</cite>, <cite class="app_court">227 S.E.2d 362</cite> (1976); Walker v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">177 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The trial judge erred, where he determined that he was not going to conduct the proceedings de novo but instead decided to review the decision of the special master on nonvalue issues as though occupying an appellate position in the proceedings, thereby addressing only whether there was any evidence to support the special master's findings of fact and whether there were any errors of law in the special master's conclusions of law.

       - The sole question to be passed upon by the assessors, or a jury in the superior court on appeal, is the amount of compensation to be paid.

       One who does not except to the findings of the special master or appeal from the judgment of condemnation cannot, on the usual appeal to a jury on the question of value, raise legal issues by way of counterclaim or motion.

       Special master's findings as to amount company was entitled to under condemnation proceeding were determinations of law; therefore, a jury trial under this section was an inappropriate method of appealing, and the company's failure to take exception to the findings acted as a waiver of its right to appeal. Big-Bin Dispos-All, Inc. v. City of Valdosta, <cite class="ga_app_court">172 Ga. App. 746</cite>, <cite class="app_court">324 S.E.2d 501</cite> (1984).

        <p>
       Since the condemnor never filed an exception to the special master's award concerning the requirement that it give the landowner advance notice of its entry onto the easement in non-emergency situations, and the superior court made the special master's award the judgment of the court, the trial court was correct when it determined that the notice provision was a viable portion of the condemnation judgment. Styers v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., <cite class="ga_court">263 Ga. 856</cite>, <cite class="app_court">439 S.E.2d 640</cite> (1994).

       Trial court properly refused to dismiss a landowner's appeal on grounds that it failed to express dissatisfaction with the compensation awarded by the special master, as it provided the utility with notice that the landowner was objecting to the valuation given on the property; moreover, in light of the interest that the utility acquired in the property, and the purposes for which it intended to use that property, consequential damages potentially represented a significant portion of the compensation the landowner could recover. Ga. Power Co. v. Stowers, <cite class="ga_app_court">282 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">639 S.E.2d 605</cite> (2006).

       Condemnation of a property owner's land by a city was upheld on appeal, as was the trial court's judgment entered upon a jury verdict in the amount of $63,361 for the property and an award of attorney fees to the city, because the property owner never challenged the valuation made by a special master and also removed the amount awarded from the registry, thereby estopping the owner from challenging the legality of the taking on appeal.

       - In a business's appeal of a special master's award of $5,000 for the loss of its business operation due to condemnation of the building it occupied and its challenge to a trial court judgment finding that it lacked a compensable business loss, that judgment was reversed because the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on the uniqueness test by incorrectly stating that difficulty relocating the business in the same general area was not a test for uniqueness. Further, the trial court erred by instructing the jury not to consider evidence of the business's difficulty in relocating to a comparable site in the area. ABM Realty Co. v.

         Entry of judgment where appeal results in lower award.

        <p>
       - Where a special master makes an award to a condemnee, who subsequently is granted a jury trial on appeal which results in a lower award, the judgment should be entered even though the condemnor never appealed the award of the special master because an appeal by either party entitles both parties to a de novo determination of the issue. Smith v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">131 Ga. App. 380</cite>, <cite class="app_court">205 S.E.2d 916</cite> (1974).

        Refusal by clerk of superior court to pay over amount awarded to condemnee
       
       which had been paid to such clerk by the condemnor in connection with its appeal for a jury trial is not a proper ground for dismissal of such appeal because where the condemnor pays the amount of the award of the assessors into the registry of the court, the condemnor is not thereafter concerned with its distribution, and, further, such condemnor is not responsible for the clerk's actions. State Hwy. Dep't v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 15</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 703</cite> (1960).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The delivery of a check, in the amount of condemnation award, to the clerk of the superior court is not payment of such amount into the registry of the court where sufficient funds to cover such check are not on deposit at the bank on which such check is drawn during the ten day period when an appeal may be filed. State Hwy. Dep't v. Farmers Gin Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 35</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 760</cite> (1960).

        Where jury is unable to agree on whether condemnee is entitled to recover expenses of litigation,
       
       including attorney fees, the trial court is not authorized to grant the condemnee's motion for judgment notwithstanding the mistrial. DOT v. Glenn, <cite class="ga_court">243 Ga. 21</cite>, <cite class="app_court">252 S.E.2d 906</cite> (1979).

        <p>
       - There being no right to a jury trial on exceptions to the special master's rulings on nonvalue issues, the trial court sits as the trier of fact and its judgment will not be disturbed if there is any evidence in the record to sustain it.

       - On appeal from a special master's award, the court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on non-value issues because that would allow new evidence which was not before the special master or a repetition of evidence which should have been preserved by transcript.

      </p>

       <p>

       Condemnor cannot insist upon its right to take property and refuse to pay the amount awarded
      
      to the condemnee at the same time. State Hwy. Dep't v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 15</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 703</cite> (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       One cannot voluntarily accept money awarded for his property and still contest right to condemn,
      
      but such acceptance in no way precludes one from protesting the value amount of the award. Tingle v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">150 Ga. App. 867</cite>, <cite class="app_court">258 S.E.2d 668</cite> (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Despite the fact that subsection (a) states that the acceptance of the award "shall not prevent any party from prosecuting the appeal," this language is not applicable to appeals in which the condemnee challenges the right to condemn, as opposed to the amount of the award. Wrege v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">203 Ga. App. 241</cite>, <cite class="app_court">416 S.E.2d 562</cite> (1992).

       - It is obvious that the Legislature in using the word "owner" not only intended it to have its ordinary signification, but in doing so, also distinguished the owner from other condemnees.

     The purpose of this special condemnation statute
    
    is to afford a speedy and fair means whereby the public authorities may acquire a clear title to the lands sought for public purposes, and the landowner and all parties concerned may receive their just compensation therefor. Denham v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 790</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 631</cite> (1936).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    The purpose and the mandatory requirement of this article is for the condemnor to pay the amount of the award into the registry of the court so that it may be disbursed after a judgment has been taken against the property described in the petition and to those responding parties whom the judge, after hearing their respective claims thereto, finds to be justly entitled. Kreutz v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 315</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 134</cite> (1963).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     In proceeding under this article, speedy action and progress is to be obtained
    
    so far as possible, and the statutes providing therefor must be strictly pursued. Denham v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 790</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 631</cite> (1936).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Fact that State of Georgia is condemnor does not deprive condemnee of equal protection of law
    
    since he is authorized to make any valid defense in the condemnation proceeding itself. Russell v. Venable, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 137</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 103</cite> (1960).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     This article is general law, and may be amended by another general law
    
    in accord with the state Constitution. Russell v. Venable, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 137</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 103</cite> (1960).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     This article makes adequate provision for anyone claiming interest to assert equitable as well as legal rights
    
    to the property in the condemnation proceeding itself. Mitchell v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 88</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    All legal and equitable issues relevant to the condemnation of a piece of land may be raised in a single proceeding under this article, unless principles of waiver or estoppel apply. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     All matters in opposition to petition to condemn property must be filed in condemnation proceeding,
    
    when the petition is filed under the provisions of this article. Howard v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">140 S.E.2d 880</cite> (1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Prior to enactment of this article, there were no pleadings in condemnation proceeding,
    
    and no hearings provided for before the presiding judge prior to appeal; questions pertaining to the right to condemn, the constitutionality of the proceedings, and similar questions, could be made by the condemnee only in a separate bill in equity. Martin v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).

    - Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t22c02s22-2-132" target="_self">22-2-132</a></cite> specifically provides the nature and character of the objections which may be urged before the presiding judge, which include "any other matters material to their respective rights"; matters pertaining to the rights of the condemnee might therefore be raised by general and special demurrers (now motions to dismiss) as in other cases, and an adverse ruling on a general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) can be reviewed by a direct bill of exceptions prior to any final judgment in the condemnation case. Martin v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     This article does not provide for any method of review of interlocutory orders,
    
    and the only final judgment in this proceeding is the judgment of award. Stewart v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="ga_app_court">66 Ga. App. 108</cite>, <cite class="app_court">17 S.E.2d 203</cite> (1941).

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.05.html#t05c03s5-3-8" target="_blank">5-3-8</a></cite>, requiring the consent of the opposite party before an appeal may be dismissed, are applicable to appeals in condemnation proceedings instituted under this article. State Hwy. Dep't v. Blalock, <cite class="ga_app_court">98 Ga. App. 630</cite>, <cite class="app_court">106 S.E.2d 552</cite> (1958).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Issue of whether condemnee intends to dedicate land to public use
    
    is an issue that the trial judge should rule on in a pretrial order. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    Whether a condemnee dedicated a large portion of the land to public use is a mixed question of law and fact concerning the nature and amount of the land in issue, and its determination is for the trial judge. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    Where there is no express dedication for public use and the requisite intent must be implied, the acts relied upon to establish such dedication must be such as clearly showed a purpose on the part of the owner to abandon his own personal dominion over such property, and to devote the same to a definite public use. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).
    </p>
    <p>

     Where condemnor pays award of assessors into registry of court

      Tender of award to owner not condition precedent to condemnor's appeal.

    <p>
     <p>
    - Where a proceeding in rem is brought to condemn property for a public use under the provisions of this article, tender of the amount awarded by the assessors to the apparent or ostensible owner of such property is not a condition precedent to the condemnor's right to pay the award into the registry of the court and enter an appeal to a jury. State Hwy. Dep't v. Farmers Gin Co., <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 70</cite>, <cite class="app_court">114 S.E.2d 537</cite>, answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga.

      Question of value is sole issue for jury on appeal.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - While all issues may be raised in an appeal from the assessors' award, the question of value is the sole issue to be submitted to the jury, and its fact-finding powers are limited to those facts directly touching on value. DeKalb County v. Jackson-Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 695</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 160</cite> (1971).

     Motion to dismiss appeal in condemnation proceedings under this article,
    
    which is regulated by Part 5, Art. I of this chapter, falls in a different category from an oral motion to strike pleadings, amendments, or answers, since the motion to dismiss the appeal raises issues of fact. Murray v. State Hwy.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The 1937-1938 amendment to this section permits counties to condemn land by petition under the provisions of this article. Hoch v. Candler, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 390</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Under the 1937-1938 amendment to this section, it is not necessary that the condemnation petition allege an unsuccessful effort to procure the land by contract or a failure to agree as to compensation. Hoch v. Candler, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 390</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Prior negotiations to procure land from owner by contract are not necessary
       
       in a proceeding brought under this section. St. Clair v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">45 Ga. App. 488</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 297</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Venue of in rem proceeding is in county in which land lies;
       
       but if the tract of land lies in two counties, such proceeding can be brought in the superior court of either county. Cook v. State Hwy. Bd., <cite class="ga_court">162 Ga. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">132 S.E. 902</cite> (1926).

       <p>
        <p>
       - It is the duty of persons claiming an interest in property sought to be condemned to establish the amount and character of the interest claimed, and in such a proceeding all interests may be condemned, whether acquired by easement or by fee simple title to the property. Marist Soc'y v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1955).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Owners of remainder interest in property who were not made parties to an in rem proceeding to condemn that property for a public purpose could obtain monetary relief for the value of their remaindermant but could not set aside the judgment of condemnation awarding title to a public body. Nelson v. State, <cite class="ga_court">254 Ga. 611</cite>, <cite class="app_court">331 S.E.2d 554</cite> (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Court may enjoin condemnor from taking possession of and entering upon land
       
       until the issues made by the petition and defensive pleadings have been determined. Mitchell v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 88</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Condemnor cannot just abandon condemnation proceeding.
       
       Marist Soc'y v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Tender or payment of award is necessary before property may be taken
       
       or the work thereon commenced. Wilson v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_app_court">85 Ga. App. 907</cite>, <cite class="app_court">70 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where no motion for new trial is made and no exception taken to verdict and judgment
       
       following an appeal by the condemnor to the superior court, the land is condemned to public servitude subject only to payment of the amount of compensation fixed by the verdict and judgment. Harrison v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 290</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 445</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        To vacate and set aside judgment for value of property condemned,
       
       affirmative action seeking to set aside judgment in favor of condemnor, and payment of all expenses and damages accrued to the condemnee, are essential. Marist Soc'y v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 564</cite> (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        County authorities may by petition condemn land for road
       
       which is about to become a part of the State Highway System. Hoch v. Candler, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 390</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1940).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Under this section, the State can, in one proceeding, condemn a right of way over two tracts of land, one owned by one of the plaintiffs and the other owned by both plaintiffs, the proceeding being one in rem and not against the individuals. In such a proceeding, all persons interested will be allotted the damages to which they are respectively entitled. Cook v. State Hwy.

        - Plaintiff's claim, that defendants' intentions in planning to condemn his property without public need and without the funds to pay for the property presented a threat of irreparable harm to him in the future, was not cognizable under Georgia law because a separate equitable petition to enjoin a condemnation governed by the statute will not lie.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Previous condemnation proceeding by petition of the county authorities was not subject to attack by the present injunction petition of the former landowner, as containing an insufficient description of the condemned land, where the description in the former proceeding identified the property as being described in plans on file in the office of the road commissioner of the county, and where the petition neither denied the existence of such plans and description nor alleged any fact showing their insufficiency. Hoch v. Candler, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 390</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1940).

        Where charter of municipality requires adoption of valid ordinance as prerequisite to condemnation

       This section specifically provides nature and character of objections which may be urged
      
      before the presiding judge, which include "any other matters material to their respective rights"; matters pertaining to the rights of the condemnee might therefore be raised by general and special demurrers as in other cases, and an adverse ruling on a general demurrer can be reviewed by a direct bill of exceptions prior to any final judgment in the condemnation case.

       Appeal from condemnation award under this section is de novo investigation.
      
      State Hwy. Dep't v. Hester, <cite class="ga_app_court">112 Ga. App. 51</cite>, <cite class="app_court">143 S.E.2d 658</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Appeal from award of assessors to jury in superior court is not a suit
      
      within the provisions of
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.44.html#t44c12s44-12-21" target="_blank">44-12-21</a></cite>. State Hwy. Dep't v. Noble, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 410</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       And such appeal does not require any process
      
      as is required in all suits at law. State Hwy. Dep't v. Noble, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 410</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Requirement of payment of costs is for benefit of officers of court
      
      and not a condition precedent to the filing of an appeal. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Clerk is not bound to receive appeal until costs have been paid to him,
      
      but if the clerk does receive an appeal without exacting the costs, the appeal is good, and the clerk becomes estopped from saying that the costs have not been paid to him - estopped as to all persons, at least, except the appellant. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Failure of condemnor to pay costs and fees within ten days after judgment does not vitiate its appeal
      
      therefrom regardless of whether or not it is a political subdivision of the state. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where a magistrate refuses to dismiss an appeal because costs have not been paid by the appellant, this amounts to a waiver of his right to have the costs paid in advance, and the appellee has no right to complain of the refusal to dismiss the appeal. Hilderbrand v. Housing Auth., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1964).

        Party's failure to sign appeal brought under this section is amendable defect
       
       and it is error for the court to strike the amendment tendered at the trial on appeal prior to the introduction of evidence and to dismiss the appeal. State Hwy. Dep't v. Hester, <cite class="ga_app_court">112 Ga. App. 51</cite>, <cite class="app_court">143 S.E.2d 658</cite> (1965).

       What is just and adequate compensation is justiciable question,
      
      and only the judiciary can lawfully determine that question. Calhoun v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 65</cite>, <cite class="app_court">153 S.E.2d 418</cite> (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       There are only two elements of damages to be considered in condemnation proceeding:
      
      first, the market value of the property actually taken; second, the consequential damage that will naturally and proximately arise to the remainder of the owner's property from the taking of the part which is taken and the devoting of it to the purposes for which it is condemned. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).

         Measure of damages is pecuniary loss sustained by owner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The measure of damages for property taken by the right of eminent domain, being compensatory in its nature, is the pecuniary loss sustained by the owner, taking into consideration all relevant factors. Ordinarily this loss is represented by the fair market value of the property interest taken, but it may be the fair and reasonable value of the property taken if in fact the market value would not coincide with the actual value thereof. Polk v. Fulton County, <cite class="ga_app_court">96 Ga. App. 733</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 736</cite> (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Anything that actually enhances value of land must be considered
       
       in order to meet the constitutional demand that the owner be paid before the taking, adequate and just compensation. DOT v. Arnold, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 502</cite>, <cite class="app_court">268 S.E.2d 775</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There are three recognized techniques for determining market value:
       
       replacement cost new less depreciation, income, and comparable sales. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Measure of consequential damages
       
       if any, to the property which the condemnee retains, is the market value of the remainder in its circumstances just prior to the time of the taking, as compared with its market value in its new circumstances just after the time of the taking. Simon v. Department of Transp., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Land and its natural components
       
       are one subject matter and what is required is evidence of the fair market value of that one subject matter. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Improvements on land are proper subjects for independent valuation
       
       in consideration of the just and adequate compensation for the total property taken. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Existing zoning regulations can be pertinent
       
       in a condemnation proceeding. DOT v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Attorneys' fees need not be included
       
       in the measure of just compensation under the Georgia Constitution. Georgia Power Co. v. Sanders, 617 F.2d 1112 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">450 U.S. 936</cite>, <cite class="s_court">101 S. Ct. 1403</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">67 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 372 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Lost profits may be used as means of awarding just and adequate compensation
       
       because the income approach necessarily takes into account what future earnings would be were the property interest not extinguished. Housing Auth. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 174</cite> (1980).

       - Since valuing property at its fair market value presupposes a willing buyer and a willing seller, properties are "unique" such that fair market value will not afford just and adequate compensation when they are not of type generally bought or sold in the open market.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Neither "privacy," which is inherent in ownership of all property, nor the fact that the condemned land was "riverfront" property, would authorize a charge on the condemned property having a value "peculiar" to the owner, or that the realty was "unique." Macon-Bibb County Water &amp; Sewerage Auth. v. Reynolds, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 355</cite>, <cite class="app_court">299 S.E.2d 592</cite> (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Whether or not property is unique is a jury question.
       
       DOT v. Dixie Hwy. Bottle Shop, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">265 S.E.2d 10</cite> (1980).

        "Unique" property is measured by variety of nonfair market methods of valuation,

       - Where a limited access highway is condemned by the State, which highway cuts off several acres from the remainder of the land of the condemnee leaving those several acres without any access thereto, testimony offered by the condemnor that with access there would be no damage to the isolated land, standing alone, is inadmissible and without probative value on the question of consequential damages to those several acres without access.

       - In a condemnation action, an expert was properly allowed to testify that a temporary easement had not diminished the fair market value of the land. If evidence could be adduced that the taking of a temporary easement had diminished the fair market value, competent evidence could also be admitted to establish the fact that the temporary taking had not diminished the fair market value.

       - Since adequate and complete relief, equitable as well as legal, is afforded any person aggrieved by a condemnation proceeding brought under this article which permits intervention by such person in the condemnation proceeding itself, a separate action in equity will not lie to enjoin the condemnation proceeding or to contest the constitutionality of the act under which condemnation is proceeding.

       - Although the plaintiff, in his capacity as executor, should have been served with notice of condemnation proceeding, the fact that he was served as one of eight "owners" of the land with notice gave him knowledge of the proceeding, and he could have intervened as executor to protect the interests of the estate under the provision of this section, that anyone claiming any interests or rights in the subject property might intervene in the condemnation proceeding, he was in no way harmed by reason of the condemnor's failure to give him official notice in his capacity as executor.

This article is also intended to make simpler and more effective the method of condemnation in those cases where conflicting interests or doubtful questions render a judicial supervision of the procedure desirable. In all particulars not otherwise specially provided for in this article, the court shall conform its procedure as nearly as possible to Articles 1 and 2 of this chapter, and the same shall remain in force.

    The necessity for taking private property for public use is a question for legislative determination, and the provisions of this article relating to such taking are not, because they fail to provide for a special tribunal to pass upon such necessity, violative of the constitutional prohibition against taking the property without due process of law.

       - A corporation chartered in another state with the right to own and operate an electric plant and engage in the business of generating, transmitting, and selling electricity for commercial and domestic use, and later domesticated in this state by appropriate proceedings, has the right to condemn the land of others for the purpose of running its lines or wires over the same and using and maintaining poles and appliances thereon in order to distribute electric current to the public from its plant.

       - Preliminary to the exercise of the power granted by this section, for the purpose of erecting an electric line with necessary poles and fixtures, it is incumbent upon the power company to serve a notice on the owner of the property sought to be condemned, which notice shall describe the property with the same definiteness as is required in a deed of conveyance of land.

        In proceeding under this section sole question for assessors is amount of compensation to be paid;

        Injunction is proper remedy to determine power of eminent domain.
       
       The remedy of the landowner who seeks to challenge the legal power of a company to condemn is to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the condemnation proceedings if they are unauthorized. Rogers v. Toccoa Power Co., <cite class="ga_court">161 Ga. 524</cite>, <cite class="app_court">131 S.E. 517</cite>, <cite class="alr">44 A.L.R. 534</cite> (1926).

       - If a landowner stands by and permits, without legal objection, a public utility company to appropriate his land to its necessary corporate use until such becomes a necessary and constituent part of its service to the public, and the rights of the public intervene to such extent that to oust the company would interrupt the service and deny it to the public, the landowner, not for the protection so much of the company but for the benefit of the public, will be estopped from recovering the land in ejectment from enjoining its use for the service, but will, if he moves in time, be remitted to an appropriate action for damages.

       - The power, telephone and telegraph companies all have the power of eminent domain, and could exercise that power to acquire the right to erect their lines upon the railroad's right of way. That they choose to acquire by contract such right, as against the railroad, does not render the railroad company liable for their alleged failure also to compensate the plaintiff for the taking or damaging of her property by their erection of power and communication lines on the railroad's right of way.

      The General Assembly finds and declares that the prompt and equitable relocation and reestablishment of persons, businesses, farmers, and nonprofit organizations displaced when the state, any of its agencies or institutions (other than the Department of Transportation), or any county, municipal corporation, school district, political subdivision, public authority, public agency, public corporation, or public instrumentality, excluding electric membership corporations as defined in paragraph (3) of Code Section 46-3-171, (collectively referred to in this chapter as "several public entities") created under the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia acquires land, with federal financial assistance, for a public use, are necessary to ensure that certain individuals do not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole. The General Assembly finds and declares that the establishment of uniform fair land acquisition policies will be beneficial to the public. The General Assembly finds that the Congress of the United States has, by enacting the Uniform Act, made funds available for relocation assistance and the implementation of certain land acquisition policies. The General Assembly further finds that the Congress of the United States has by the aforesaid statute provided for the total cessation after July 1, 1972, of federal financial assistance for public works projects which will displace persons or businesses unless the state complies with the requirements of the Uniform Act. The General Assembly finds and declares that the construction of public works projects with federal financial assistance is vital to the state and is in the best interest of the people of the state and that providing for the continuation of federal financial assistance at the highest possible level for public works projects is a legitimate public purpose. The General Assembly further finds that the cost of providing the assistance and services provided for in this chapter should be, and the same are declared to be, part of the necessary cost of federal-aid public works projects.

     <p>
      The several public entities shall have the authority, as a last resort, to provide replacement housing when a federal-aid project financed in whole or in part with federal aid cannot proceed to actual construction because no comparable replacement sale or rental housing is available. In carrying out the relocation assistance activities, the several public entities shall be authorized to make payments, construct or reconstruct with their own forces, cause to be constructed or reconstructed, and purchase by deed or condemnation any real property for the purposes of providing replacement housing. The acquiring public entity may exchange, lease, or sell to the displaced person such replacement housing. Whenever any real property has been acquired under this Code section and thereafter the acquiring public entity determines that all or any part of such property or any interest therein is no longer needed for such purposes because of changed conditions, the acquiring public entity is authorized to dispose of such property or interest therein in accordance with Code Section 50-16-144.
