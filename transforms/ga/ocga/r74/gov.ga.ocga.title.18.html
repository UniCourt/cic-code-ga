       - When money is placed in bank on general deposit, title passes immediately to the bank, and the relation of the debtor and creditor is thereby created between the bank and the depositor.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ordinarily, when checks or drafts are endorsed and deposited in a bank, the presumption is that the title does not pass and the relation of debtor and creditor does not exist until the collection has been made.

       - Equitable remedy of marshaling securities will not be so extended as to delay or inconvenience the creditor in collection of a debt secured by collateral notes by confining the creditor to particular collaterals at instance of one whose note is included among collaterals and who claims equitable set-off against the payee of the note.

       - When one creditor holds a claim against two persons, and another creditor holds a claim against one of those two, equity will not compel the former creditor to proceed against that one of joint debtors against whom the latter creditor has no claim, in order that the funds of the debtor may be applied exclusively to the payment of the debtor's claim. Equity will never do this for the sake of the creditor who has a single claim, but will do it when it is equitable as between the two debtors that it should be done. Love v.

       - Petition in equity against corporation and individual states cause of action when it is alleged that the plaintiff is the creditor of a now insolvent corporation, and that the individual has converted to the individual's own use assets of the corporation in excess of the amount of the plaintiff's claim, leaving no other assets sufficient in amount with which to pay the corporate debt, and which suit seeks to hold liable individual as trustee ex maleficio.

       - Creditors can bring a bill in equity to reach interest of beneficiary under a trust unless beneficiary's interest is exempt by terms of trust or by statute. The creditor must exhaust legal remedies before proceeding in equity, but this requirement does not apply if it appears that an attempt to exhaust legal remedies would be futile. Henderson v.

       - Willful failure to provide for maintenance and support of spouse and children creates lawful demand which, when legally enforced, is called alimony, and is a debtor/creditor relation. Thus, the wife was a creditor at the time of the conveyances which are alleged to have been made to defeat her claim for alimony, although no alimony judgment had been rendered at the time and it would be inequitable and unjust not to allow her to maintain an action for judgment in rem against the husband's property when she was unable to obtain personal service due to the husband's willful avoidance of service.

       - If insolvent debtor, for purpose of hindering, delaying, and defrauding creditors, uses the debtor's assets in the purchase of property, taking title in the name of a third person who has full knowledge of the purpose of the transaction, such transaction is fraudulent as to existing creditors.

       - Willful failure to provide for the maintenance and support of spouse and children creates a lawful demand which, when legally enforced, is called alimony, and is debtor/creditor relationship. Thus, wife was creditor at time of conveyances which are alleged to have been made to defeat her claim for alimony, although no alimony judgment had been rendered at time of conveyances, and it would be inequitable and unjust not to allow her to maintain an action for judgment in rem against the husband's property when she was unable to obtain personal service due to his willful avoidance of service.

    - Creditor cannot divide obligation to pay creditor a stated sum of money into fragments, and assign them to a number of different persons, thereby subjecting debtor to more than one claim, and in order to enforce such partial assignment of a single debt, acceptance by debtor must be shown.

    Partial assignment of a debt due is enforceable in equity, although debtor may not assent, if all parties at interest are before the court, so that the right of each in the fund may be determined in one suit and settled by one decree.

        Even an insolvent debtor may prefer one creditor to another,

   §
   28-301, was reserved to the debtor; and provided further that the intent of the debtor, known to the creditor, shall not be to hinder, delay, or defraud other creditors. Moncrief Furnace Co. v.

        <p>
       - Husband who is indebted to his wife may convey property to her in preference to other creditors; but this rule is subject to qualification that conveyance must be made only for purpose of paying or securing his wife as creditor, and not be tainted with any intention to hinder, delay, or defraud others, such conveyance being judged by intention with which it is made and accepted, and not by its consideration or effect.

       While it is true that "a debtor may prefer one creditor to another," and may convey property for this purpose, such right is subject to qualification that conveyance must be made only for purpose of paying or securing creditor so preferred, and not be tainted with any intentions to hinder, delay, or defraud others; such conveyance being judged by intention with which it is made and accepted, and not by its consideration or effect.

       - Voluntary bankrupt has an assignable interest in property claimed in the bankrupt's petition as exempt under the constitution and homestead laws of this state; and the bankrupt may assign property in good faith to an existing creditor before it is set apart by a trustee in bankruptcy, and therefore before exemption is confirmed by a referee in bankruptcy.

       Voluntary bankrupt has an assignable interest in the property claimed by the bankrupt in the bankrupt petition as exempt under the constitution and homestead laws of this state and can transfer this interest in good faith to the bankrupt's creditor either in extinguishment of, or to secure, a preexisting debt, before the property is set aside by the trustee in bankruptcy, and before the proceeding is confirmed by the bankrupt court.

       - Life insurance policy was a chose in action and may be assigned by an insured as security for a debt under former Code 1933,

       Since rights of beneficiary and debtor were subjected by assignment of insurance policy to full amount of debt secured by such assignment which debt exceeded the value of the policies, the beneficiary had no further interest in such policies, and no rights to assert as to the policies in receivership proceedings.

    - Fraudulent Conveyance Act applied to conveyance of own property intended to delay or defraud, known to taker. Jones v. Foster, <cite class="ga_court">150 Ga. 277</cite>, <cite class="app_court">103 S.E. 491</cite> (1920) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

    <p>
     <p>
    Before conveyance by insolvent debtor can be attacked by debtor's creditor, it must appear that the insolvent debtor actually parted with some valuable asset which belonged to the debtor, and which, if title had been retained, might have been subjected to debts. S.T. &amp; W.A. Dewees Co. v. Paul B. Carter &amp; Co., <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 68</cite>, <cite class="app_court">8 S.E.2d 376</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933,

    This rule applies with equal force in determining character and the purpose of the transaction between an individual and a corporation controlled by the individual. S.T. &amp; W.A. Dewees Co. v.

    As to claims against one corporation whose property has been purchased by another, the general law would apply, prohibiting any transaction in fraud of creditors, and preventing an assignment by an insolvent wherein it or stockholders reserved any benefit or trust.

     <b>
      Conditions for transfer invalid.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - Transfer is invalid against creditors, and therefore a trustee in bankruptcy if: (1) debtor conveys property with intent to delay or defraud debtor's creditors; and (2) recipient of property knows of debtor's intention to defraud. Loeb v. Dante, 1 Bankr. 547 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1979) (decided under former Code 1933, 28-201).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Invalidation.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - Invalidation is permitted whenever: (1) bona fide creditor of debtor exists at time of transfer; (2) debtor and transferee intended conveyance as a gift rather than a sale; and (3) debtor is insolvent at time of transfer or rendered insolvent as a result of transfer. Loeb v. Dante, 1 Bankr. 547 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1979) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   28-201).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Meaning of "delay."
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - "Delay" cannot be construed to include situations in which debtor files reorganization petition in bankruptcy and obtains protection of automatic stay to suspend creditors from recovering possession of collateral; the automatic stay of an otherwise proper petition is not a delay prohibited or contemplated. Chattanooga Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Northwest Recreational Activities, Inc., 4 Bankr. 36 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   28-201).

     <b>
      Distinction between equitable and legal remedies.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Equitable remedy of setting aside the conveyance for satisfaction of the original debt is completely different from the right at law to recover damages for the fraud of the conveyance itself, and judgment creditors are not required to give up their right to satisfy the judgment debt by getting the conveyance set aside, in order to get damages for the fraud. Kesler v. Veal, <cite class="ga_app_court">182 Ga. App. 444</cite>, <cite class="app_court">356 S.E.2d 254</cite>, modified on other grounds, <cite class="ga_court">257 Ga. 677</cite>, <cite class="app_court">362 S.E.2d 214</cite> (1987) (decided under former

     <b>
      Remedy available to one reducing claim to judgment lien.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - Former Code 1933,
   §§
   28-101, 28-102, 28-201, and 28-202 provided creditors with the right to set aside fraudulent transfers, and this remedy was available to any creditor at the time of transfer who thereafter reduces the creditor's claim to a judgment lien. United States v. Hickox, 356 F.2d 969 (5th Cir. 1966) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §§
   28-101, 28-102, 28-201, and 28-202 ).

     <b>
      Time of acquisition of lien.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Creditor, who brings suit to prevent a debtor from carrying into effect a threat to convey away all of the debtor's property for purpose of defeating claims of such creditor, acquires a lien from commencement of suit to prevent such fraudulent conveyance, and after service of process. Law v. Coleman, <cite class="ga_court">173 Ga. 68</cite>, <cite class="app_court">159 S.E. 679</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910).

    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Status of trustee in bankruptcy.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - Condition precedent to filing action was that only judgment creditors can void certain acts. Section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides trustee with status of a hypothetical judgment creditor. Therefore, this condition precedent is satisfied in suit by trustee alleging fraudulent conveyance of real property by debtor to debtor's spouse. Pettigrew v. Graham, 16 Bankr. 606 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1981) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   28-201).

    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Remedy under bankruptcy law.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - When a creditor has been injured by fraudulent or other willful misconduct by the debtor, the appropriate remedy under bankruptcy law as to the debtor is an exception to or a denial of a discharge. As to another creditor which may have willfully participated in the misconduct, the appropriate remedy under bankruptcy law is an adjudication of the relative priorities between the wrongdoer and the other innocent creditors. Sandersville Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Douthit, 47 Bankr. 428 (M.D. Ga. 1985) (decided under former
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c02s18-2-22" target="_self">18-2-22</a></cite>).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Denial of discharge in bankruptcy.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Determination that bankruptcy debtor made the subject transfers to the debtor's wife in an intentional effort to perpetrate fraud and conceal assets may constitute a sufficient legal basis for denying the debtor's discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C.
   §
   727(a)(2)(A). Sikes v. Norton, 185 Bankr. 945 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1995) (decided under former
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c02s18-2-22" target="_self">18-2-22</a></cite>).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Right of trustee in bankruptcy to avoid transfer.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Trustee in bankruptcy may avoid any transfer of property by bankrupt which any creditor of bankrupt might have avoided; and this right of trustee extends to all transfers made and accepted in fraud of creditors, regardless of whether transactions occurred within four months prior to bankruptcy or not. Sullivan v. Ginsberg, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 840</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 163</cite> (1935) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   28-201).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    When an insolvent debtor did not receive equivalent value in exchange for a transfer, the transfer could be avoided. Ragsdale v. South Fulton Mach. Works, Inc. (In re Whitacre Sunbelt, Inc.), 200 Bankr. 422 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1996) (decided under former
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c02s18-2-22" target="_self">18-2-22</a></cite>).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      In spite of fraudulence of conveyance, subsequent creditor who sustains no harm is denied relief.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - One may make a conveyance with actual intent to defraud future creditor or to defeat debt which, though contemplated, is not yet in actual existence; and, unless creditor is hurt by such conveyance, relief will be denied. Roach v. Roach, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 40</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 423</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933).

     <b>
      Alimony claims.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Words "and others" appearing in former Code 1933,
   §
   28-201 bring a claim for alimony within the statute's provisions. McGahee v. McGahee, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 91</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 675</cite> (1948) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   28-201).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    One suing for alimony may obtain relief against fraudulent conveyance by spouse, as such person, if not a creditor in the ordinary sense, is within phrase "and others." Von Kamp v. Gary, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 875</cite>, <cite class="app_court">52 S.E.2d 591</cite> (1949) (decided under former Code 1933,

     <b>
      Conveyances in pursuance of common scheme.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Fact that value of property covered by several conveyances was largely in excess of debt due petitioner did not afford ground for demurrer as all of the conveyances were executed in pursuance of a common scheme and could be attacked without reference to the amount of the judgment creditor's debt as compared to the value of property conveyed. Peoples Loan Co. v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 537</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 811</cite> (1945) (decided under former Code 1933,

     <b>
      Deed to secure debt also subject to attack.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Conveyance of property for present valuable consideration may be void as to creditors and a deed to secure debt is as much open to attack for fraud as an absolute conveyance. Burkhalter v. Glennville Bank, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 147</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 644</cite> (1937) (decided under former Code 1933,

   §
   3220 was inapplicable to restrain sale under power in security deeds, when equity in lands was set apart as year's support. Redman v. Thaxton, <cite class="ga_court">167 Ga. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">146 S.E. 445</cite> (1929) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    Deed made to defraud creditors, though void as to creditors was good between grantor and grantee, and former after executing such deed has no title to property thereby conveyed, and therefore cannot have title set apart and exempted as a homestead under the laws of this state.

    Under the 1882 provisions, the law was designed solely to protect rights of creditors, and consequently rendered a fraudulent transfer void only as against them, and make no provision whatever in regard to its effect between the parties to the transfer.

    Though deed be made to defraud creditors, neither vendor nor those in privity with vendor will be allowed to set up this fact to defeat action of ejectment brought by vendee as the deed is good as between parties thereto and those in privity with them, though void as to creditors.

      Circumstantial evidence may be of high importance.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - When a conveyance, a security deed, or a mortgage is attacked as having been made to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors of the maker of such instrument, circumstantial evidence is of the highest importance in determining the good faith or bad faith - the real intent - of the grantor in the execution of the instrument; direct testimony as to the real intent of the grantor and grantee whose motives are under attack can only be obtained from these interested persons, and consequently necessarily any circumstance that may throw light on their conduct and motive is admissible for the jury's consideration. Gower v. Cohn, 643 F.2d 1146 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §

      Facts necessary for conclusive presumption of fraud.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Only facts necessary to render deed from husband to wife fraudulent in law are indebtedness, insolvency of debtor, and voluntariness of deed. When these facts are proved, the law conclusively presumes fraudulent intent and declares instrument void so far as creditors who held demands against the debtor at the time of conveyance are concerned.

    <p>
     <p>
    - When conveyance between near relatives is attacked upon ground of fraud, the law requires jury to examine every circumstance with care and caution, and one who is charged with defrauding honest creditors should be allowed to introduce evidence concerning one's general character. Wimberly v. Toney, <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 416</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 257</cite> (1932) (decided under former law).

    - Testamentary trust created by a wife in favor of her husband was not a fraudulent transfer against a judgment creditor since the wife had been released from liability on the judgment by virtue of a settlement agreement executed in bankruptcy court and, thus, creation of the trust was not a debtor's act that could be deemed fraudulent against the creditor under former O.C.G.A.

    - When a debtor makes a fraudulent transfer of property or choses in action, which is voidable as to creditors, property in hands of a fraudulent grantee is held by a debtor in trust for creditors of a fraudulent grantor; and if it has been converted into money, the money is impressed with same trust, and the fraudulent grantee will be compelled in equity to account for the money.

       - Although Georgia courts had not yet had an opportunity to address the issue of whether there was a cause of action for aiding and abetting a fraudulent transfer when the alleged aider-abetter was not a debtor or a transferee, the instant court concluded that Georgia courts were not likely to recognize such an action; the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA)

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c02s18-2-70" target="_self">18-2-70</a></cite> et seq., did not refer to parties other than debtors, creditors, and transferees, and further there was no language in UFTA that suggested the creation of a distinct cause of action for aiding and abetting claims against non-transferees.

        Transferees were not entitled to summary judgment on a Chapter 7 trustee's claim to avoid transfers as actually fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Georgia law as the transferees failed to demonstrate by either affirmative evidence or by pointing to lack of evidence that the trustee could not carry the trustee's burden at trial regarding the debtor's intent to transfer the debtor's assets. Rather, several badges of fraud existed, including that the debtor made the transfer to an insider (a company wholly owned by a director of the debtor who owned more than 20 percent of the stock of the debtor) and that the transfer was made for the purpose of satisfying an antecedent debt owed to an insider.

   decedent's subsequent purchase of land and deeding of the land in a corporate entity's name without documented consideration from the entity, and the decedent's involvement in the capitalization of the entity with purported funds from the spouse could all be found to constitute transfers made with the intent to fraudulently defeat claims of the

The court inferred the debtor's fraudulent intent based on badges of fraud under Georgia fraudulent conveyance statute, including that the debtor did not fully disclose the value of the account; the debtor transferred a portion of the funds to the debtor's mother and daughter, who were insiders; funds were substantially all of the debtor's assets; and the debtor transferred a portion of the funds without adequate consideration.

        - When a bank sought relief from the automatic stay to proceed with a sheriff's sale under a prepetition state court consent judgment that resolved a fraudulent transfer action against the debtor and others by declaring the transfer "void," the court denied the motion as unnecessary. No interest in the property revested in the debtor because, applying rules of contract construction to the consent judgment, and giving the consent judgment a construction that rendered it in compliance with Georgia fraudulent transfer statutes, the court determined that the word "void" meant void as to the bank, not void ab initio.

   1304 because the assertion that only an unsecured creditor with a claim arising prior to the transfers could seek their avoidance was legally flawed. Under the state statutes, a transfer for less than reasonably equivalent value was constructively fraudulent as to creditors whose claims arose after the transfers when the debtor was engaged or was about to engage in a business or transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction.

        Transferees were not entitled to summary judgment on a Chapter 7 trustee's claim to avoid transfers as actually fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Georgia law as the transferees failed to demonstrate by either affirmative evidence or by pointing to lack of evidence that the trustee could not carry the trustee's burden at trial regarding the debtor's intent to transfer the debtor's assets. Rather, several badges of fraud existed, including that the debtor made the transfer to an insider (a company wholly owned by a director of debtor who owned more than 20 percent of the stock of the debtor) and that the transfer was made for the purpose of satisfying an antecedent debt owed to an insider.

        Fraudulent transfer claims involving evidence of several badges of fraud survived summary judgment; the equitable doctrine of earmarking was inapplicable because apportionment of the debtor's estate was not at issue, the in pari delicto defense was inapplicable because liquidators were pursuing the fraudulent transfer claims for the benefit of innocent creditors, and factual issues existed as to whether payment on an antecedent debt was actual value.

        Although transfers by a Chapter 7 debtor to insiders could not be avoided because the debtor received reasonably equivalent value, the transfers were nonetheless avoidable because they were made on account of antecedent debt at a time when the debtor was insolvent. Watts v. MTC Dev., LLC (In re Palisades at W. Paces Imaging Ctr., LLC), 501 Bankr. 896 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2013).

        Actual fraud was adequately pled by alleging badges of fraud sufficient to infer the fraudulent nature of transfers to insiders; moreover, insolvency resulting in constructive fraud also was adequately pled. Ralls Corp. v. Huerfano River Wind, LLC, 27 F. Supp. 3d 1303 (N.D. Ga. 2014).

       - Although the transfer of a house was accompanied by some badges of fraud, the trial court abused the court's discretion in enjoining further disposition of the house, pending adjudication of the merits of wrongful death and fraudulent transfer claims since the transferor gave the house to the transferor's three minor grandchildren in Florida three months before the transferor murdered the decedent.

       Evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict under the plaintiff's theory of fraudulent transfer and civil conspiracy as some evidence authorized the jury to find that a deed conveying the property owner's sole interest to the real property to the owner and one defendant as joint tenants with right of survivorship without any money exchanged prior to death was to evade the plaintiff before a promissory note was paid.

The investors had a claim for the return of principal the investors invested, based on fraud, the investors gave value for payments the investors received up to the amount of the principal the investors invested because the payments satisfied their claim, and their right to keep the payments did not depend on whether the investments the investors made were characterized as debt or equity.

        - There was no showing of transferees' good faith in fraudulent transfers from bankruptcy debtors since the lack of information from the debtors, the refusal of the debtors to allow transferees to conduct due diligence, and the usurious interest paid by the debtors clearly indicated that the transactions were fraudulent; thus, the transfers from bankruptcy debtors were avoidable.

       The transfer occurred as part of the Settlement Agreement after the transferee sued the debtor and, as such, the transferee did not enforce a security interest in compliance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code; moreover, there was not a segregated, discrete fund in which the transferee could have exercised the transferee's security interest.

       - Former director's putative transferee met the transferee's burden for summary judgment purposes of asserting that a fraudulent transfer claim was time-barred, but the creditor failed to point to specific evidence that gave rise to a triable issue with respect to whether the limitation period did not bar the claim.

       - Judgment creditor's fraudulent transfer action was not shown to be barred by limitations because, even assuming that the reference to the year 2003 in unwitnessed and unrecorded deeds from the judgment debtor proved that the deeds were executed in 2003, those deeds could not prove the passing of title, and questions concerning the judgment creditor's diligence in discovering the alleged fraud were generally questions for a trier of fact.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Attachment proceedings were unknown at common law and are to be strictly construed, especially as to nonresident debtors. Mills v. Findlay, <cite class="ga_court">14 Ga. 230</cite> (1853).

       - In absence of statute or decision, the right to proceed by attachment is not limited to citizens or residents of the state, and "it is generally immaterial that the attaching creditor is a nonresident." Harmon v. Wiggins, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 469</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 847</cite> (1934).

        <p>
       - Creditor's rights under paragraph (6) of former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   5055 were not affected by the fact that the debtor has other property which might be subjected to the payment of the debtor's debts. Bush v. Dean, <cite class="ga_app_court">17 Ga. App. 364</cite>, <cite class="app_court">86 S.E. 1075</cite> (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent allegations of property in Georgia, there was no basis for the issuance of a writ of attachment, although the defendants resided outside of Georgia. Ralls Corp. v. Huerfano River Wind, LLC, 27 F. Supp. 3d 1303 (N.D. Ga. 2014).

        Plaintiff in attachment must prove demand before taking a judgment against attached property,
       
       although declaration in attachment sets forth demand in orderly and distinct paragraphs, consecutively numbered. Walden v. Barwick, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 508</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1945).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When no jurisdiction is obtained over the debtor's person, the remedy is a proceeding in rem, in that it proceeds against property in custody of court and the judgment binds such property only; but when jurisdiction of debtor's person is obtained, either by personal service or appearance, proceeding is ordinarily in personam, and a personal judgment is rendered without regard to the attachment.

       - In case of attachment against nonresident debtor executed by levy, jurisdiction of a court of this state attaches by virtue of the seizure of property of such nonresident, and when the officer executing the levy seizes certain property as property of such nonresident debtor, and so makes the debtor's return to the court, it acquires such jurisdiction as will enable the court to proceed to judgment subjecting the debtor's interest in the property to the payment of the debt.

      No writ of attachment shall issue unless accompanied by a bond with good security, conditioned to pay the defendant all costs and damages that he may sustain in consequence of the issuance of the writ of attachment in the event that the amount claimed to be due was not due, that no lawful ground for issuance of the attachment existed, or that the property sought to be attached was not subject to attachment. The bond shall be in a sum equal to twice the amount claimed due in the plaintiff's application. The bond shall be presented to the clerk of the court where the application provided for in Code Section 18-3-9 is sought to be filed for approval by such clerk prior to filing of the writ of attachment.

       - When the defendants were not personally served with notice of pendency of attachment, did not appear and defend, and did not give bond and security to replevy property attached, an in personam judgment against the defendants was accordingly erroneous. Broome v. Graham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 682</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 824</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Written notice to the defendant that attachment was pending against the defendant stating the court to which attachment was returnable, and the time, and stating on what property attachment had been levied, was sufficient compliance with former Code 1868,
   §
   3233 to authorize proceedings as in ordinary suit, especially if the defendant appeared and pleaded to the merits. Pool v. Perdue, <cite class="ga_court">44 Ga. 454</cite> (1871) (decided under former Code 1868,

       - If, pending attachment, the defendant dies, and the defendant's administrator was made party to the proceeding, and no notice was given, as provided by former Code 1873,
   §
   3309, the administrator stood precisely as did the deceased defendant. The administrator may attack the validity of the attachment, and if the administrator's objection was good the whole proceeding fell. Ross v.

       - When nonresident defendants in attachment were given sufficient notice to put the defendants upon inquiry in time to have defended, but failed to do so, the supreme court will not control decision of presiding judge in refusing to allow the defendants to open judgment rendered in an attachment case for purpose of pleading to merits. Steers &amp; Co. v. Morgan &amp; Armstrong, <cite class="ga_court">66 Ga. 552</cite> (1881) (decided under former Code 1873,

       - Although notices of attachment were not signed by the plaintiff, plaintiff's attorney, or anyone as agent for the plaintiff, when the notices conveyed information required by statute and defendants were in no manner prejudiced by absence of a signature, the notice was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to judgment on the declaration filed as at common law.

      When a writ of attachment is issued against the property of the defendant, the defendant may at any time traverse the plaintiff's affidavit upon which the attachment was obtained, stating that the affidavit is untrue or legally insufficient. Upon filing of the traverse, the court shall issue a show cause order to the plaintiff requiring him to appear at a specified time, which shall not be more than ten days from the filing of the traverse, to prove the grounds for the issuance of the attachment. If the plaintiff shall fail to carry the burden of proof, the order authorizing the attachment shall be revoked.

        <p>
       - When ground of attachment is duly traversed, defendant is entitled to introduce evidence to sustain the defendant's traverse, and presiding justice errs in holding that it is too late to do this after the defendant has replevied property attached. Brumby v. Rickoff, <cite class="ga_court">94 Ga. 429</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E. 232</cite> (1894) (decided under former Code 1873,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the plaintiff makes an affidavit for purpose of obtaining attachment against an administrator, and the administrator files traverse to affidavit, the plaintiff is a competent witness upon trial of issue formed, even though the contract, which is the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, was made with intestate. Effect of verdict for the defendant, upon such issue, is a dismissal of attachment. Ouzts v. Seabrook, <cite class="ga_court">47 Ga. 359</cite> (1872) (decided under former Code 1868,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant in attachment does not waive traverse to the plaintiff's affidavit by afterwards pleading to the merits of the action. The two defenses are perfectly consistent, the former going to the writ and the latter to the declaration. Parker v. Brady, <cite class="ga_court">56 Ga. 372</cite> (1876) (decided under former Code 1868,

       - When issue on traverse is found in favor of the defendant, all defendant gains is that levy falls, and if judgment is obtained on merits the judgment does not date from time of levy, but the judgment would take lien on property attached as well as on other property from date of judgment only.

It shall be the duty of any one of the officers to whom an attachment is directed, where the defendant has removed his property beyond the limits of the county in which the attachment is issued and returnable, to follow the property into any county of the state, levy the attachment upon such property of the defendant which is necessary to satisfy the claim of the plaintiff, and return the property to the county in which the attachment is returnable.

      When the plaintiff in attachment wishes to levy his attachment upon property in a different county from that in which the same is returnable, it shall be the duty of the judge issuing the attachment, upon the request of the plaintiff, his agent, or his attorney at law, to make out a copy or copies of the original attachment, bond, and affidavit and certify the same officially to be true copies. Upon delivery of the copies of the attachment, bond, and affidavit, as directed, to any officer of the county in which the property of the defendant is located, it shall be the duty of the officer forthwith to levy the attachment upon the property of the defendant located in that county and to return the attachment, with his actings and doings entered thereon, to the court to which the original attachment is returnable.

       - Since no replevy bond was given by the defendant, an agreement between parties that the constable should sell the property on a given date and deliver proceeds of the sale to the sheriff, to be held by the sheriff until final disposition of the case, controls rights of parties, and the provision, allowing the defendant in attachment to replevy the property, did not apply.

       - When property attached has been replevied, attachment is dissolved, bond is substituted for property, and the case stands as if the case had been founded on ordinary principles. Thompson v.

       When defendant in attachment personally appears, replevies property attached, and defends action on its merits, the case proceeds in all respects as an ordinary action in personam and, accordingly, when there was no evidence to support single ground of attachment alleged, and traverse to attachment was well taken, this was not ground for a new trial or for setting aside judgment entered against defendant on the merits. Patne v. Oliver, <cite class="ga_app_court">96 Ga. App. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 154</cite> (1957) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Replevy bond binds defendant not only to appear, but to pay judgment,

       When grounds of attachment fail,
      
      replevy bond, insofar as it is sought to bind sureties thereon, fails also; in such event there is no liability of sureties on the bond, but their remedy is by affidavit of illegality or, perhaps, by some collateral motion. Patne v. Oliver, <cite class="ga_app_court">96 Ga. App. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 154</cite> (1957).

       <p>

       Validity of replevy bond is dependent upon validity of attachment;
      
      and if attachment has been dismissed, no liability attaches against surety on the replevy bond, notwithstanding the plaintiff in attachment may, after obtaining jurisdiction in personam over the defendant, have proceeded with the suit and obtained a common-law judgment thereon against the defendant. Burnette v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_app_court">38 Ga. App. 396</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E. 36</cite> (1928).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since liability of sureties depends upon that of principal, if principal is discharged on ground of bankruptcy or death, case should be dismissed as a whole. Langston v. Watts, <cite class="ga_court">142 Ga. 439</cite>, <cite class="app_court">83 S.E. 92</cite> (1914).

       If, upon levy of attachment for purchase-money, defendant replevies property by giving bond and security as provided in former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   5113, and if within four months after levy of such attachment, the defendant is adjudicated a bankrupt, the lien of attachment is void, and the principal debtor and surety on replevy bond are both discharged. Longshore v. Collier, <cite class="ga_app_court">37 Ga. App. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">140 S.E. 636</cite> (1927).

    <p>
     <p>
    - Former Georgia garnishment law was a special statutory proceeding enacted subsequent to the first Georgia Constitution and was in derogation of the common law. Thus, a garnishment action was not a civil action of such a nature in which a trial by jury was guaranteed. Mull v. Mull, <cite class="ga_app_court">167 Ga. App. 687</cite>, <cite class="app_court">307 S.E.2d 675</cite> (1983) (decided under former O.C.G.A. T. 18, C. 4).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Garnishment constitutes a distinct suit
    
    against separate party for an entirely new cause of action. Ahrens &amp; Ott Mfg. Co. v. Patton Sash, Door &amp; Bldg. Co., <cite class="ga_court">94 Ga. 247</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E. 523</cite> (1894) (decided under former Ga. L. 1855-56, p. 36); Woods v.

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Original summons is served, rather than a copy thereof,

    <p>
     <p>
    - Promise by officer that the officer would notify garnishee when to answer, coupled with sheer ignorance on part of latter, was not an excuse. Jones v.

      Failure to make timely answer.

    - Claim, debt, or demand owing by garnishee to the defendant, to be subject to process of garnishment cannot be an unliquidated claim for damages against the garnishee. Curtis v. Bailey, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 119</cite>, <cite class="app_court">179 S.E. 633</cite> (1935) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

     Garnishment proceedings are purely statutory

       - Bank account holder whose accounts contained funds that were exempt from garnishment had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the garnishment statute as there was a substantial likelihood the account holder would suffer future garnishment proceedings and the return of the account holder's previously garnished funds did not moot the action because the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception applied.

        Garnishment is a purely statutory proceeding, and will not be extended
       
       so as to reach money or property of the defendant not made subject thereto by statute. Hartsfield Co. v. Zakas Bakery, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga. App. 284</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 825</cite> (1934) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        <p>

        Garnishment proceedings are purely statutory,
       
       in derogation of common law, and must be strictly pursued. Arnold v. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 254</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 316</cite> (1933) (decided under former law).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       As garnishment proceedings are purely statutory the proceedings cannot be extended to cases not enumerated in the statutes, and courts have no power to enlarge the remedy or hold under it property not made subject to process.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Purpose of garnishment proceeding is to assure that property in hands of third party is held subject to order of the court until conflicting claims are adjudicated. It frequently has been held that a judgment creates no lien on choses in action belonging to the defendant. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 294</cite> (1933) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

       Garnishment lien is intended to reach something actually due the defendant and which the defendant could force the garnishee to pay. A.C. White Transf. &amp; Storage Co. v. Grady Mem.

        - Garnishment proceeding notifies the debtor not to pay the debt, operates to arrest the debt's payment, fixes a lien upon it, and ultimately subjects it to the plaintiff's claim. Thus, it operates both on the person of the garnishee and on the debt itself. In re Eidson, 6 Bankr. 613 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Ga. L. 1976, p. 1608,

       - Trial court did not err by allowing a garnishment action to proceed because the garnishor was not pursuing a reverse-piercing claim, or any other equitable action, against the garnishee, rather, the action arose from a garnishment action expressly authorized by law.

Fazio v. Growth Dev. Corp., 168 Bankr. 1009 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-90" target="_self">18-4-90</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Garnishee failed to amend the defective answer as permitted by law and, pursuant to former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-90" target="_self">18-4-90</a></cite>, the garnishee was automatically in default. Because the garnishee failed to establish the presence of a nonamendable defect on the face of the record or pleadings, the court abused the court's discretion by granting the motion to set aside the default judgment.

       - Garnishee can admit an indebtedness but contend and show by denial that the indebtedness admitted is exempt from the process of garnishment, and because of its denial, the garnishee can fail to pay the amount into court without subjecting itself to the penalty of being subject to judgment for the entire indebtedness.

       - After the parents of a shooting victim obtained judgment against the owner of the property on which their son was shot, and the owner filed bankruptcy, the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court and holding that the judgment debtor had no garnishment action against the owner's insurer; the insurer could contest, under former O.C.G.A.

        Statement in answer that garnishee is not indebted

        Answer in garnishment is designed to show indebtedness of garnishee
       
       for two periods of time prior to the date of service of the summons, and also the period between service and answer. Mark Ten Homes Corp. v.

       - Garnishee's reliance on signature cards and the debtor's assurances that the bank accounts were trust accounts was insufficient to relieve the garnishee of liability for failing to list these accounts on the garnishment answer. Wachovia Bank v. Unisys Fin. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">221 Ga. App. 471</cite>, <cite class="app_court">471 S.E.2d 554</cite> (1996) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Bank was not entitled to assume that an account was a legitimate corporate account when the bank did not follow the bank's own internal procedure with respect to opening the account and, thus, the bank was not excused from complying with a summons of garnishment naming a signatory on the account, nor did the fact that the bank was unable to locate the account relieve the bank from the bank's responsibilities under the garnishment statutes.

       - Summons of garnishment directing the garnishee to deliver any property into court that is subject to garnishment establishes a lien on the subject property that attaches from the date of service of the summons of garnishment. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-25 (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        Garnishment action remains ancillary to or dependent upon principal action

       - Because of ancillary nature of garnishment, the relevant factor in determining priorities of several garnishments is rank of judgment on which garnishment is dependent and not rank of garnishment lien. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-25 (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       A garnishment proceeding is an action between the plaintiff and garnishee; provided, however, that at any time before a judgment is entered or before money or other property subject to garnishment is distributed, the defendant may become a party to the garnishment by filing a claim with the clerk of court and may use the form set forth in Code Section 18-4-82. A defendant's claim shall assert the basis upon which he or she claims that his or her money or other property is exempt from garnishment. Money or other property may be exempt from garnishment for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the limitations on garnishment as provided in Code Sections 18-4-5 and 18-4-53, exemptions as provided in Code Section 18-4-6, the plaintiff not having a judgment against the defendant, the amount claimed due by the plaintiff being erroneous, such money or other property being subject to a claim held by a third party that is superior to the judgment described in the affidavit of garnishment, or other legal or statutory defenses. Even when earnings are held at a financial institution, such money may be exempt from garnishment due to the limitations on garnishment as provided in Code Sections 18-4-5 and 18-4-53, exemptions as provided in Code Section 18-4-6, or other reasons.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In a postjudgment garnishment proceeding, the judgment debtor's traverse asserting the judgment was void or voidable was clearly an impermissible challenge to the validity of the judgment. The trial court was not authorized to consider the debtor's verified complaint for damages which addressed issues in bar of judgment in support of the debtor's traverse, and the trial court improperly dismissed the proceeding by granting summary judgment on the debtor's verified complaint without holding an evidentiary hearing on the debtor's traverse.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-65" target="_self">18-4-65</a></cite>, there was nothing to prevent a court from only issuing a stay without a release, and such a stay relieved the garnishee from answering even without issuance of a release; thus, the trial court erred in entering a default judgment against a bank as the garnishee in a garnishment proceeding while a stay was in effect based on the bank's failure to file an answer to the garnishment complaint.

      Within 20 days after the plaintiff has been served with the garnishee's answer, the plaintiff may file a traverse stating that the garnishee's answer is untrue or legally insufficient. Such statement places in issue all questions of law and fact concerning the garnishee's answer. The form for a plaintiff's traverse is set forth in Code Section 18-4-87.

        <p>
       - Traverse may be amplified at option of the plaintiff, but nothing more is necessary to bring in question the liability of the garnishee to the garnishing creditor than an unqualified, though general, denial of the truth of the garnishee's answer. Rainey v. Eatonton Coop. Creamery, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Plaintiff need not traverse answer

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Issue involved is whether garnishee is indebted as averred in traverse;
       
       it is not pertinent to such inquiry whether a prior judgment had been rendered against the defendant. Whaley v. Kear, <cite class="ga_court">139 Ga. 16</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E. 390</cite> (1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        Issue whether alleged indebtedness is mere cover for fraud may be tried.

        <p>

        Absent dissolution bond, defendant not party to trial of issue

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        At trial of traverse, plaintiff can recover from garnishee
       
       only what the defendant could have recovered from the garnishee. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. AVCO Fin. Servs., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">129 Ga. App. 605</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E.2d 309</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When the defendant gives no bond to dissolve garnishment and there is no claim filed and the only traverse to answer of the garnishee was by the plaintiff in execution, the general rule is that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in execution, the party traversing garnishee's answer.

       - In a garnishment proceeding, a trial court properly declined to disburse certain bank funds to the judgment holder since a claimant timely filed a claim to the funds, established sole ownership to the funds, and complied with the necessary procedural requirements to become a party to the action. Further, since a dispute existed about whether the funds were properly subject to garnishment and the trial court had not yet distributed the funds to the judgment holder, the trial court did not err by resolving the dispute rather than allowing an expedited distribution.

       Summary judgment was proper on the ground of res judicata because: (1) the gist of the assignee's complaint was that the individual's claim to the garnished funds was superior to that of the corporation; (2) this was the very issue that the individual raised in the motion to intervene in the garnishment proceeding; (3) the garnishment court denied the motion to intervene, finding that the individual failed to file the claim under oath as required by former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-95" target="_self">18-4-95</a></cite>; (4) by failing to file a verified claim, the individual failed to present the necessary evidence to prove that the individual held a superior claim; and (5) thus, it was the individual's failure of proof that deprived the garnishment court of jurisdiction to consider the claim, and the denial of the motion to intervene had the effect of a negative adjudication on the merits barring any subsequent claims to the garnished funds.

       - Merely suing out garnishment proceedings will not alter priority of creditor's liens against bank deposits. Patterson v. Beck, <cite class="ga_court">133 Ga. 701</cite>, <cite class="app_court">66 S.E. 911</cite> (1910) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

       <p>
        <p>
       - In a garnishment proceeding, a trial court properly declined to disburse certain bank funds to the judgment holder since a claimant timely filed a claim to the funds, established sole ownership to the funds, and complied with the necessary procedural requirements to become a party to the action. Further, since a dispute existed about whether the funds were properly subject to garnishment and the trial court had not yet distributed the funds to the judgment holder, the trial court did not err by resolving the dispute rather than allowing an expedited distribution. Akridge v. Silva, <cite class="ga_app_court">298 Ga. App. 862</cite>, <cite class="app_court">681 S.E.2d 667</cite> (2009) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        Exception to no lien rule exists in alimony cases
       
       when there is an execution against the property or an attachment of the proceeds of the sale of the defendant's property for past due installments. Cale v.

        An ex-wife's fi. fa. and summons of garnishment
       
       relate back to original divorce judgment entered against her ex-husband and she takes priority as the holder of oldest judgment; but she can take priority only in that portion of the garnishment fund which represents ex-husband's arrearage on the date of the second creditor's judgment because she does not have a lien at the latter date for future installments that were not yet payable.

        <p>
       - Because of ancillary nature of garnishment, the relevant factor in determining priorities of several garnishments is rank of judgment on which garnishment is dependent and not rank of garnishment lien. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-25 (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       Priority lien that initial garnishing creditor obtains by virtue of initial creditor's having first served garnishee does not defeat priority of subsequent garnishing creditor with senior judgment. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U81-25 (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       When two or more judgment creditors claim priority to money or property that is paid into court pursuant to summons of garnishment, the garnishing creditor whose judgment is founded on senior judgment has priority over garnishing creditor whose judgment is founded on junior judgment. 1981 Op.

       - In a postjudgment garnishment proceeding, the judgment debtor's traverse asserting that the judgment was void or voidable was clearly an impermissible challenge to the validity of the judgment. The trial court was not authorized to consider the debtor's verified complaint for damages which addressed issues in bar of judgment in support of the debtor's traverse, and the trial court improperly dismissed the proceeding by granting summary judgment on the debtor's verified complaint without holding an evidentiary hearing on the debtor's traverse.

        Purpose of traverse to garnishee's answer
       
       is to give the garnishee right to be heard and for protection of the garnishee's rights and interests in the premises. Ole Campbellton Constr. Co. v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - By enacting a specific time limitation within which the plaintiff must traverse the garnishee's answer, the legislature expressed a clear intent to provide for automatic discharge of the garnishee from all obligations under the summons if the plaintiff did not notify the court and the garnishee otherwise within the brief prescribed time period. Nockonwood Indus., Inc. v. Tuloka Affiliates, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">164 Ga. App. 424</cite>, <cite class="app_court">296 S.E.2d 405</cite> (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Defendant who has elected to become a party to the garnishment proceedings and who has a claim superior to that of the plaintiff to money or property in the hands of the garnishee is authorized to, and indeed must, assert such a claim and then traverse the answer of the garnishee. Terrell v. Fuller, <cite class="ga_app_court">160 Ga. App. 56</cite>, <cite class="app_court">286 S.E.2d 50</cite> (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - In garnishment proceeding, the plaintiff was required to traverse garnishee's answer within 15 days after filing of answer even though it had not been served with a copy of the answer where it had failed to include its or its attorney's address on the summons of garnishment. Nockonwood Indus., Inc. v. Tuloka Affiliates, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">164 Ga. App. 424</cite>, <cite class="app_court">296 S.E.2d 405</cite> (1982) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - When the name and address of the plaintiff's attorney appeared on the summons of garnishment but no certificates of service were attached to the answers and neither the plaintiff nor the attorney acknowledged receipt, the requirement that the plaintiff traverse the answers within 15 days of service was never triggered. Lowery v. Dallis, <cite class="ga_app_court">237 Ga. App. 309</cite>, <cite class="app_court">513 S.E.2d 740</cite> (1999) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - When garnishee answers summons of garnishment, statements in garnishee's answer are accepted as true, and garnishee is discharged from all further liability unless either the claimant or the defendant files a traverse contesting the answer. West v. West, 402 F. Supp. 1189 (N.D. Ga. 1975) (decided under former Code 1933,

       When answer is not traversed, all statements of fact appearing in answer are taken as true. Darlington v. Belt, <cite class="ga_app_court">12 Ga.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Traverse may be amplified at option of the plaintiff, but nothing more is necessary to bring in question the liability of the garnishee to the garnishing creditor than an unqualified, though general, denial of the truth of the garnishee's answer. Rainey v. Eatonton Coop. Creamery, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   46-303).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Plaintiff need not traverse answer
       
       admitting that garnishee is indebted for specified sum to the defendant. Harris v. Exchange Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">17 Ga. App. 700</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E. 40</cite> (1916) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   5283).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Issue involved is whether garnishee is indebted as averred in traverse;
       
       it is not pertinent to such inquiry whether a prior judgment had been rendered against the defendant. Whaley v. Kear, <cite class="ga_court">139 Ga. 16</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E. 390</cite> (1912) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   5283).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Issue whether alleged indebtedness is mere cover for fraud may be tried.
       
       Smith v. Dysard Constr. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">15 Ga. App. 192</cite>, <cite class="app_court">82 S.E. 761</cite> (1914) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   5283).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Absent dissolution bond, defendant not party to trial of issue
       
       raised by plaintiff's traverse of garnishee's answer. Leake v. Tyner, <cite class="ga_court">112 Ga. 919</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E. 343</cite> (1901) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,
   §
   4721).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        At trial of traverse, plaintiff can recover from garnishee
       
       only what the defendant could have recovered from the garnishee. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. AVCO Fin. Servs., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">129 Ga. App. 605</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E.2d 309</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   46-303).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When traverse is filed, burden of proof is upon traversing party.
       
       Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. AVCO Fin. Servs., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">129 Ga. App. 605</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E.2d 309</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code 1933,
   §
   46-303).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Burden of proof is on party traversing answer of garnishee.
       
       Rockmart Bank v. Nix, <cite class="ga_app_court">14 Ga. App. 238</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E. 673</cite> (1914) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,
   §
   5283).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the defendant gives no bond to dissolve garnishment and there is no claim filed and the only traverse to answer of the garnishee was by the plaintiff in execution, the general rule is that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in execution, the party traversing garnishee's answer. Rainey v. Eatonton Coop. Creamery, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1943) (decided under former Code 1933,

Further, since a dispute existed about whether the funds were properly subject to garnishment and the trial court had not yet distributed the funds to the judgment holder, the trial court did not err by resolving the dispute rather than allowing an expedited distribution.

     <p>
      When a garnishee is a financial institution and fails or refuses to file a garnishee answer by the fifteenth day after the date of service of the summons of garnishment, such garnishee shall automatically be in default. The default may be opened as a matter of right by the filing of a garnishee answer within 15 days of the day of default and payment of costs. If the case is still in default after the expiration of the period of 15 days, judgment by default may be entered at any time thereafter against such garnishee for the amount remaining due on the judgment obtained against the defendant as shown in the plaintiff's affidavit of garnishment.

In determining whether a garnishee may be relieved of liability, the court shall consider and compare the accuracy and quantity of the information supplied by the plaintiff pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of Code Section 18-4-7 with the manner in which such garnishee maintains and locates its records, the compliance by such garnishee with its own procedures, and the conformity of the record systems and procedures with reasonable commercial standards prevailing in the area in which such garnishee is located.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-65" target="_self">18-4-65</a></cite>, there was nothing to prevent a court from only issuing a stay without a release, and such a stay relieved the garnishee from answering even without issuance of a release; thus, the trial court erred in entering a default judgment against a bank as the garnishee in a garnishment proceeding while a stay was in effect based on the bank's failure to file an answer to the garnishment complaint.

    - When the defendant defaulted and a money judgment was obtained against it, there was a "judgment" on the merits, even though there was no expressly adjudicated "final judgment," and the use of post-judgment garnishment procedures, rather than prejudgment garnishment procedures, to enforce the judgment provided the defendant with the process to which it was due under the federal constitution.

       - Claim arises against the garnishee at the time the garnishee falls into default by failing to file answers in a continuing garnishment proceeding, and is separate and distinct from any claim which may have existed prior to that time. Fazio v. Growth Dev. Corp., 168 Bankr. 1009 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       Garnishee failed to amend the defective answer as permitted by law and, pursuant to former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-90" target="_self">18-4-90</a></cite>, the garnishee was automatically in default. Because the garnishee failed to establish the presence of a nonamendable defect on the face of the record or pleadings, the court abused the court's discretion by granting the motion to set aside the default judgment. Oxmoor Portfolio, LLC v. Flooring &amp; Tile Superstore of Conyers, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">320 Ga. App. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">740 S.E.2d 363</cite> (2013) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       In a continuing garnishment action, the trial court erred in failing to enter a default judgment after the garnishee failed to file answers or open default within 15 days of the first answer and, contrary to the trial court's ruling, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-43" target="_self">18-4-43</a></cite> did not require the plaintiff to file the motion for default within a certain time period but permitted the motion to be filed anytime thereafter.

The garnishee may rely upon the information as to the termination date of the duty of support of any individual claimed in the affidavit of continuing garnishment for support, the amount of the duty of support to be paid, any sums paid by the defendant between the date of the filing of such affidavit and the date of the initial garnishee answer, and the amount of the original arrearage existing as of the date of such affidavit, unless the defendant files a claim against such affidavit or the garnishee's answer and the court enters any finding otherwise.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c04s18-4-117" target="_self">18-4-117</a></cite> is to ensure that only employers will be subject to continuing garnishment and that nonemployer garnishees will be automatically discharged with regard to the continuing aspect of the action; however, that section does not purport to discharge a nonemployer garnishee from such general garnishment liability as existed at time original answer was filed.

       NOTICE TO DEFENDANT OF RIGHT AGAINST GARNISHMENT OF MONEY, INCLUDING WAGES, AND OTHER PROPERTY
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       You received this notice because money, including wages, and other property belonging to you have been garnished to pay a court judgment against you. HOWEVER, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR MONEY, INCLUDING WAGES, OR OTHER PROPERTY.
      </h5>
      <p>
       READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.
      </p>
      <p>
       State and federal law protects some money, including wages, from garnishment even if it is in a bank. Some common exemptions are benefits from social security, supplemental security income, unemployment, workers' compensation, the Veterans' Administration, state pension, retirement funds, and disability income. This list of exemptions does not include all possible exemptions. A more detailed list of exemptions is available at the Clerk of Court's office located at __________________ (Name of Court), __________________ (Address), __________________ (City), Georgia __________ (ZIP Code), and on the website for the Attorney General (www.law.ga.gov).
      </p>
      <p>
       Garnishment of your earnings from your employment is limited to the lesser of 25 percent of your disposable earnings for a week or the amount by which your disposable earnings for a week exceed $217.50. More than 25 percent of your disposable earnings may be taken from your earnings for the payment of child support or alimony or if a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows a higher amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       TO PROTECT YOUR MONEY, INCLUDING WAGES, AND OTHER PROPERTY FROM BEING GARNISHED, YOU MUST:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Complete the Defendant's Claim Form as set forth below; and
      </p>
      <p>
       2. File this completed claim form with the Clerk of Court's office located at __________________ (Name of Court), __________________ (Address), __________________ (City), Georgia __________ (ZIP Code).
      </p>
      <p>
       FILE YOUR COMPLETED CLAIM FORM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. You may lose your right to claim an exemption if you do not file your claim form within 20 days after the Garnishee's Answer is filed or if you do not mail or deliver a copy of your completed claim form to the Plaintiff and the Garnishee at the addresses listed on this notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Court will schedule a hearing within ten days from when it receives your claim form. The Court will mail you the time and date of the hearing at the address that you provide on your claim form. You may go to the hearing with or without an attorney. You will need to give the Court documents or other proof that your money is exempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clerk of Court cannot give you legal advice. IF YOU NEED LEGAL ASSISTANCE, YOU SHOULD SEE AN ATTORNEY. If you cannot afford a private attorney, legal services may be available.

       - Trial court erred in granting a Texas corporation's motion to dismiss a debtors' action alleging that the debt adjustment services a Texas corporation provided them violated Georgia statutes specifically regulating the business of "debt adjusting" as set forth in O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c05s18-5-1" target="_self">18-5-1</a></cite> et seq. on the ground that the parties' contract contained a provision selecting Texas as the forum for any dispute because, if enforced, the contract's forum selection and choice of law provisions requiring the debtors to bring their action before a Texas court applying Texas law would operate in tandem to deprive the debtors of specific statutory protections set forth in
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t18c05s18-5-1" target="_self">18-5-1</a></cite> et seq., relating to debt adjustment agreements; because that would violate Georgia's public policy established in those provisions, the forum selection and choice of law provisions in the contract were invalid and unenforceable.
