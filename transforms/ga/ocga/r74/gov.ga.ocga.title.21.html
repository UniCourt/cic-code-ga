     Constitutional guarantees and protections.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - Although the federal Constitution confers no right to vote as such, it does guarantee to every citizen the right to participate on a fair and equal basis with all other citizens in the electoral process, once a state has chosen to select its public officials by popular vote. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 504 (1982).
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   The right to vote, which encompasses such distinct concerns as the citizen's opportunity to cast a vote, the community's chance to be represented within a larger polity in proportion to its population, the racial group's ability to prevent the purposeful dilution of its voting power, the candidate's capacity to ensure a place on the ballot, and the constituent's chance to contribute to a chosen candidate implicates fundamental U.S. Const., amend. 1 and due process interests and is therefore protected, at least in part, by the due process and equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const., amend. 14 against state encroachment. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 504 (1982).
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   The interests encompassed by the right to vote are among the liberties protected against state infringement by the due process guarantee. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 504 (1982).
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   The right to vote is clearly fundamental, and is protected by both the due process and equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const., amend. 14. In either case, any alleged infringement of the right to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized, for a state has precious little leeway in making it difficult for citizens to vote. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 504 (1982).
   </p>
   <h5 class="lalign">
    <b>
     Denial or abridgment of voting rights.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - If the right to vote is denied altogether or abridged in a manner which renders the electoral process fundamentally unfair, a violation of due process may be found. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 504 (1982).
   </p>
   <h5 class="lalign">
    <b>
     Discrimination amongst members of electorate.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - If the state discriminates in favor of some members of the electorate and against others, the equal protection guarantee may have been violated. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 504 (1982).
   </p>
   <h5 class="lalign">
    <b>
     Conduct favoring "ins" against "outs".
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - When so fundamental a right as voting is concerned, the courts have not hesitated to conclude that any conduct which favors the "ins" against the "outs" is impermissible. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 504 (1982).
   </p>
   <h5 class="lalign">
    <b>
     State may regulate exercise of suffrage.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - A citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction. This right is not absolute, for the states have the power to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised, absent the discrimination which the Constitution condemns. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S.

   <p>
    <p>
   - The election law is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. Schloth v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">134 Ga. App. 529</cite>, <cite class="app_court">215 S.E.2d 292</cite> (1975).

        - The Second Congressional District was drawn to segregate voters according to their race and so violated equal protection. Johnson v. Miller, 922 F. Supp. 1552 (S.D. Ga. 1995).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Race was the predominant, overriding factor explaining the General Assembly's decision to attach to the Eleventh District various appendages containing dense majority-black populations, thereby giving rise to a valid equal protection claim under the principles announced in Shaw v. Reno, <cite class="us_code">509 U.S. 630</cite>, <cite class="s_court">113 S. Ct. 2819</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">125 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 511 (1993), and the district could not be sustained as narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Miller v. Johnson, <cite class="us_code">515 U.S. 900</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 2475</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">132 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 762 (1995).

    - The administration of elections is generally a matter of state concern, but United States Supreme Court decisions leave no room for doubt that voting rights are, at bottom, federally protected.

    <p>
     <p>
    - The "liberty" protected from state impairment by the due process clause of U.S. Const., amend. 14 includes the freedoms of speech and association guaranteed by U.S. Const., amend. 1. These freedoms under U.S. Const., amend. 1 extend to political activities such as running for elective office. State election practices must therefore serve legitimate state interest narrowly and fairly to avoid obstructing and diluting these fundamental liberties. Duncan v. Poythress, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">459 U.S. 1012</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S. Ct. 368</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">74 L.

    - Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. Especially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.

      <li id="t21c02s21-2-5ol1b">
       The Secretary of State upon his or her own motion may challenge the qualifications of any candidate at any time prior to the election of such candidate. Within two weeks after the deadline for qualifying, any elector who is eligible to vote for a candidate may challenge the qualifications of the candidate by filing a written complaint with the Secretary of State giving the reasons why the elector believes the candidate is not qualified to seek and hold the public office for which he or she is offering. Upon his or her own motion or upon a challenge being filed, the Secretary of State shall notify the candidate in writing that his or her qualifications are being challenged and the reasons therefor and shall advise the candidate that he or she is requesting a hearing on the matter before an administrative law judge of the Office of State Administrative Hearings pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 13 of Title 50 and shall inform the candidate of the date, time, and place of the hearing when such information becomes available. The administrative law judge shall report his or her findings to the Secretary of State.

       The Secretary of State shall determine if the candidate is qualified to seek and hold the public office for which such candidate is offering. If the Secretary of State determines that the candidate is not qualified, the Secretary of State shall withhold the name of the candidate from the ballot or strike such candidate's name from the ballot if the ballots have been printed. If there is insufficient time to strike the candidate's name or reprint the ballots, a prominent notice shall be placed at each affected polling place advising voters of the disqualification of the candidate and all votes cast for such candidate shall be void and shall not be counted.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-5ol1d">
       In the event that a candidate pays his or her qualifying fee with a check that is subsequently returned for insufficient funds, the Secretary of State shall automatically find that such candidate has not met the qualifications for holding the office being sought, unless the bank, credit union, or other financial institution returning the check certifies in writing by an officer's or director's oath that the bank, credit union, or financial institution erred in returning the check.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-5ol1e">
       The elector filing the challenge or the candidate challenged shall have the right to appeal the decision of the Secretary of State by filing a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County within ten days after the entry of the final decision by the Secretary of State. The filing of the petition shall not itself stay the decision of the Secretary of State; however, the reviewing court may order a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown. As soon as possible after service of the petition, the Secretary of State shall transmit the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceedings under review to the reviewing court. The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Secretary of State as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of the Secretary of State are:

     <ol class="alpha">
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-6ol1a">
       Every candidate for county office who is certified by the county executive committee of a political party or who files a notice of candidacy, and every candidate for municipal office who is certified by a municipal executive committee of a political party or who files a notice of candidacy, shall meet the constitutional and statutory qualifications for holding the office being sought.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-6ol1b">
       The superintendent upon his or her own motion may challenge the qualifications of any candidate referred to in subsection (a) of this Code section at any time prior to the election of such candidate. Within two weeks after the deadline for qualifying, any elector who is eligible to vote for any such candidate may challenge the qualifications of the candidate by filing a written complaint with the superintendent giving the reasons why the elector believes the candidate is not qualified to seek and hold the public office for which the candidate is offering. Upon his or her own motion or upon a challenge being filed, the superintendent shall notify the candidate in writing that his or her qualifications are being challenged and the reasons therefor and shall advise the candidate that he or she is setting a hearing on the matter and shall inform the candidate of the date, time, and place of the hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-6ol1c">
       The superintendent shall determine if the candidate is qualified to seek and hold the public office for which such candidate is offering. If the superintendent determines that the candidate is not qualified, the superintendent shall withhold the name of the candidate from the ballot or strike such candidate's name from the ballot if the ballots have been printed. If there is insufficient time to strike the candidate's name or reprint the ballots, a prominent notice shall be placed at each affected polling place advising voters of the disqualification of the candidate and all votes cast for such candidate shall be void and shall not be counted.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-6ol1d">
       In the event that a candidate pays his or her qualifying fee with a check that is subsequently returned for insufficient funds, the superintendent shall automatically find that such candidate has not met the qualifications for holding the office being sought, unless the bank, credit union, or other financial institution returning the check certifies in writing by an officer's or director's oath that the bank, credit union, or financial institution erred in returning the check.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-6ol1e">
       The elector filing the challenge or the candidate challenged shall have the right to appeal the decision of the superintendent by filing a petition in the superior court of the county in which the candidate resides within ten days after the entry of the final decision by the superintendent. The filing of the petition shall not itself stay the decision of the superintendent; however, the reviewing court may order a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown. As soon as possible after service of the petition, the superintendent shall transmit the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceedings under review to the reviewing court. The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the superintendent as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of the superintendent are:

In the event any temporary order is sought, the petition may be presented to the administrative judge prior to its filing for consideration of the application for such order. If the petition upon which temporary relief is sought prior to the filing will be filed in any county of the circuit of the administrative judge, then the petition may be presented to the administrative judge of an adjoining district prior to its filing for consideration of the application for such order.

      The State Election Board may examine under oath any person concerning any matter connected with or bearing on the proper discharge of its duties; and any member of the board may administer such oath. The board shall have full power to subpoena persons and papers and to compel the witnesses to answer under oath touching any questions which may properly come before the board and to take, through its agent, the depositions of witnesses. The board, in investigating the administration of primary and election laws within a county or any frauds or irregularities in primaries and elections held therein, shall conduct each hearing concerning same at a place within such county. No witness shall be compelled to attend if he or she should reside more than 100 miles from the place of hearing by the nearest practical route; provided, however, that the board may compel the taking of his or her testimony by deposition in the county of the residence of the witness. The sheriff of any county, or his or her deputy, or agent of the board shall serve all processes issued by the board; or the same may be served by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery; and the production of an appropriate return receipt issued by the post office or commercial delivery firm shall constitute prima-facie evidence of such service. In case of the refusal of any person subpoenaed to attend or testify, such facts shall be reported forthwith by the board to the appropriate superior court, or to a judge thereof, and such court or judge shall order such witness to attend and testify. On failure or refusal to obey such order, such witness shall be dealt with as for contempt. Any witness so subpoenaed, and after attending, shall be allowed and paid the same mileage and fee as now allowed and paid witnesses in civil actions in the superior court.

         Effect of federal preclearance procedure.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Where plaintiff political party held no convention in 1986 to choose its nominees but claimed it was denied ballot access by the fact that it was notified of the resolution of the federal preclearance procedure one day after the deadline for filing notice of candidacy, the court found no merit in this argument since the notice of candidacy provision, enacted a year before the June 9, 1986 preclearance determination, was not altered by the 1986 amendments in O.C.G.A. T. 21 and thus was not subject to the preclearance determination. Libertarian Party v. Harris, 644 F. Supp. 602 (N.D. Ga. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff political body contended federal preclearance of the 1986 amendments to this title was "late," plaintiff should have complied with the unchallenged Election Code requirements of holding a convention and filing notice of candidacy. Libertarian Party v. Harris, 644 F. Supp. 602 (N.D. Ga. 1986).

T. 21 and thus was not subject to the preclearance determination. Libertarian Party v. Harris, 644 F. Supp. 602 (N.D. Ga. 1986).

       - Whenever a political party holds a primary in this state, it is by law an integral part of the election machinery. Once a decision to hold a primary is made, state statutes take hold and direct every essential step from registration and qualification of voters to the placing of the names of the nominees on the general election ballot.

Ct. 905</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">90 L. Ed. 1025</cite> (1946) (decided under former Code 1933, Title 34).

Upon the application being made, a judge of such court shall fix a time and place for hearing the matter in dispute as soon as practicable; and notice thereof shall be served with a copy of such application upon the officer with whom the nomination petition was filed and upon the petitioner. At the time so fixed the court, or any judge thereof assigned for the purpose, shall hear the case. If after such hearing the said court shall find that the decision of the officer was erroneous, it shall issue its mandate to the officer to correct his or her decision and to grant the nomination petition. From any decision of the superior court an appeal may be taken within five days after the entry thereof.

        - Where a given sheet contained the names of eight Bibb County electors and two Jones County electors, it was permissible for the party to delete the names of the Jones County electors. Although a petition must not contain "material alterations" without the consent of the signers, a deletion of a name would not violate those provisions, as it was obviously intended to prevent changes in names or addresses to keep improper signatures on a petition. 1965-66 Op.

        - Where plaintiff political party held no convention in 1986 to choose its nominees but claimed it was denied ballot access by the fact that it was notified of the resolution of the federal preclearance procedure one day after the deadline for filing notice of candidacy, the court found no merit in this argument since the notice of candidacy provision, enacted one year before the June 9, 1986 preclearance determination, was not altered by the 1986 amendments in O.C.G.A. T. 21 and thus was not subject to the preclearance determination. Libertarian Party v. Harris, 644 F. Supp. 602 (N.D. Ga. 1986).

       <p>
        Where plaintiff political body contended federal preclearance of the 1986 amendments to O.C.G.A. T. 21 was "late," plaintiff should have complied with the unchallenged Election Code requirements of holding a convention and filing notice of candidacy. Libertarian Party v. Harris, 644 F.

Such primary shall be held in each year in which a presidential election is to be conducted on a date selected by the Secretary of State which shall not be later than the second Tuesday in June in such year. The Secretary of State shall select such date no later than December 1 of the year immediately preceding such primary. A state political party or body may by rule choose to elect any portion of its delegates to that party's or body's presidential nominating convention in the primary; and, if a state political party or body chooses to elect any portion of its delegates, such state political party or body shall establish the qualifying period for those candidates for delegate and delegate alternate positions which are to be elected in the primary and for any party officials to be elected in the primary and shall also establish the date on which state and county party executive committees shall certify to the Secretary of State or the superintendent, as the case may be, the names of any such candidates who are to be elected in the primary; provided, however, that such dates shall not be later than 60 days preceding the date on which the presidential preference primary is to be held.

      Purpose of registration statutes.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Registration statutes have for their purpose the regulation of the exercise of the right of suffrage, not to qualify or restrict the right to vote. Franklin v. Harper, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 779</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 221</cite> (1949), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">339 U.S. 946</cite>, <cite class="s_court">70 S.

    Registration laws are the means or machinery under which proofs are furnished showing the existence of the voter's qualifications. Franklin v. Harper, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 779</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 221</cite> (1949), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">339 U.S. 946</cite>, <cite class="s_court">70 S.

     Registration laws must be impartial,

      Limitation on legislature's power to determine voter qualifications.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - The legislature, even in the absence of express constitutional power, can provide for the registration of voters; but where the state Constitution provides who shall be entitled to vote, the legislature cannot take from or add to the qualifications unless the power is granted expressly or by necessary implication. Franklin v. Harper, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 779</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 221</cite> (1949), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">339 U.S. 946</cite>, <cite class="s_court">70 S.

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    The legislature has wide latitude in determining how the qualifications required by the Constitution may be determined, provided it does not deny the right of franchise by making the exercise of such right so difficult or inconvenient as to amount to a denial of the right to vote.

Harper, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 779</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 221</cite> (1949), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">339 U.S. 946</cite>, <cite class="s_court">70 S.

         Injunction was properly issued against officials who rejected voter registration forms.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Preliminary injunction was properly issued against state officials who had rejected voter registration forms that had been mailed to the Georgia Secretary of State because the plaintiffs were substantially likely to prevail in their suit and the public interest was served by the preservation of the applicants' voting rights because: (1) the Secretary of State had rejected the forms based upon the fact that they had been bundled and mailed in together, rather than individually; (2) state law had to comply with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), 42 U.S.C.
   ยง
   1973gg et seq.; (3) the NVRA did not prohibit registration drives or prohibit third-party submission of individual voter registration forms and specifically required that states should register all voters that timely mailed in valid voter registration forms; and (4) Georgia's anti-bundling policy did little, if anything, to prevent fraud or assist in the assessment of voter eligibility.

   ยง
   1973gg et seq., was sufficient to allege a legal injury-in-fact that was fairly attributable to the conduct of the state officials that were sued in the suit; and (3) the plaintiffs did not have to show that their claims were valid or that they would prevail in the suit in order to have standing to assert their claims.

Any qualified county or municipality seeking reimbursement of such costs shall present an itemized description of such costs to the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State, after a review of the report of such costs incurred by a county or municipality, shall find that all or portions of such costs were reasonable and were directly related to the preparation of such descriptions and lists, he or she shall approve all of those parts of the costs deemed reasonable and shall reimburse the counties or municipalities for such expenses.

       - A trial court properly denied a losing candidate's petition to contest the election results of a mayoral election held in a town as the losing candidate failed to meet the burden of establishing that any misconduct, fraud, or irregularity occurred that placed the result of the election in doubt based on the county clerk signing the document reflecting the election results, instead of the election superintendent, and the clerk's failure to purge the voters list, which was not an obligation of the election supervisor anyway. The omission of the statutory language providing directions on how to cast a vote likewise did not necessitate a new election since the poll manager testified that the poll manager and other poll workers instructed each voter how to fill out the ballot and established that there was no concern or confusion by the voters regarding the ballot.

       <p>
        <p>
       - A trial court properly denied a losing candidate's petition to contest the election results of a mayoral election held in a town as the losing candidate failed to meet the burden of establishing that any misconduct, fraud, or irregularity occurred that placed the result of the election in doubt based on the county clerk signing the document reflecting the election results, instead of the election superintendent, and the clerk's failure to purge the voters list, which was not an obligation of the election supervisor anyway. The omission of the statutory language providing directions on how to cast a vote likewise did not necessitate a new election since the poll manager testified that the poll manager and other poll workers instructed each voter how to fill out the ballot and established that there was no concern or confusion by the voters regarding the ballot.

      The names of all candidates for offices which the General Assembly has by general law or local Act provided for election in a nonpartisan election shall be printed on each official primary ballot; and insofar as practicable such offices to be filled in the nonpartisan election shall be separated from the names of candidates for party nomination to other offices by being listed last on each ballot, with the top of that portion of each official primary ballot relating to the nonpartisan election to have printed in prominent type the words "OFFICIAL NONPARTISAN ELECTION BALLOT." In addition, there shall be a ballot that contains just the official nonpartisan election ballot available for electors who choose not to vote in a party primary. Directions that explain how to cast a vote, how to write in a candidate, and how to obtain a new ballot after the elector spoils his or her ballot shall appear immediately under the caption, as specified by rule or regulation of the State Election Board. Immediately under the directions, the name of each such nonpartisan candidate shall be arranged alphabetically by last name under the title of the office for which they are candidates and be printed thereunder. The incumbency of a candidate seeking election for the public office he or she then holds shall be indicated on the ballot. No party designation or affiliation shall appear beside the name of any candidate for nonpartisan office. An appropriate space shall also be placed on the ballot for the casting of write-in votes for such offices. In the event that no candidate in such nonpartisan election receives a majority of the total votes cast for such office, there shall be a nonpartisan election runoff between the candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes; and the names of such candidates shall be placed on the official ballot at the general primary runoff in the same manner as prescribed in this Code section for the nonpartisan election and there shall be a separate official nonpartisan election runoff ballot for those electors who do not choose or are not eligible to vote in the general primary runoff. In the event that only nonpartisan candidates are to be placed on a run-off ballot, the form of the ballot shall be as prescribed by the Secretary of State or election superintendent in essentially the same format as prescribed for the nonpartisan election. The candidate having a majority of the votes cast in the nonpartisan election or the candidate receiving the highest number of votes cast in the nonpartisan election runoff shall be declared duly elected to such office.

     <ol>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol11">
       It shall provide facilities for voting for such candidates as may be nominated and upon such questions as may be submitted;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol12">
       It shall permit each elector, in one operation, to vote for all the candidates of one party or body for presidential electors;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol13">
       Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this Code section for presidential electors, it shall permit each elector, at other than primaries, to vote a ticket selected from the nominees of any and all parties or bodies, from independent nominations, and from persons not in nomination;

      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol14">
       It shall permit each elector to vote, at any election, for any person and for any office for whom and for which he or she is lawfully entitled to vote, whether or not the name of such person or persons appears upon a ballot label as a candidate for election; to vote for as many persons for an office as he or she is entitled to vote for; and to vote for or against any question upon which he or she is entitled to vote;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol15">
       It shall preclude each elector from voting for any candidate or upon any question for whom or upon which he or she is not entitled to vote; from voting for more persons for any office than he or she is entitled to vote for; and from voting for any candidate for the same office or upon any question more than once;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol16">
       It shall be capable of adjustment by poll officers so as to permit each elector at a primary to vote only for the candidates seeking nomination by the party in whose primary he or she is then voting and so as to preclude him or her from voting for the candidates seeking nomination by any party in whose primary he or she is not then voting;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol17">
       It shall fairly permit each elector to deposit, write in, or affix upon receptacles or devices provided for the purpose ballots containing the names of persons for whom he or she desires to vote whose names do not appear upon the machine; provided, however, that, if the machine does not fairly permit such a vote to be cast, an elector desiring to vote for any person whose name does not appear on the machine shall be permitted to vote in the election by the use of a paper ballot which shall be furnished by the superintendent;

       It shall have voting devices for separate candidates and questions, which shall be arranged in separate parallel rows or columns, so that, at any primary, one or more adjacent rows or columns may be assigned to the candidates of a party or body and shall have parallel office columns or rows transverse thereto;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol111">
       It shall have a public counter or other device, the register of which is visible from the outside of the machine, which shall show during any period of voting the total number of electors who have operated the machine during such period of voting;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol112">
       It shall have a protective counter or other device, the register of which cannot be reset, which shall record the cumulative total number of movements of the operating mechanism;

      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol113">
       It shall be provided with a lock or locks, by the use of which, immediately after the polls are closed or the operation of the machine for a primary or election is completed, all movements of the registering mechanism are absolutely prevented;

       It shall be safely transportable;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol119">
       It shall be so constructed and controlled that during the progress of voting it shall preclude every person from seeing or knowing the number of votes registered for any candidate and from tampering with any of the registering mechanism; and
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-322ol120">
       If it is of a type equipped with a mechanism for printing paper proof sheets and not requiring the counters to be made visible in order to canvass the votes recorded on the machine, the door or other device concealing such counters or keeping the same concealed may be equipped with a lock or locks, requiring the simultaneous use of three separate and substantially different keys to open or operate the same.

In such cases, appropriate ballots shall be printed for such candidates, offices, or questions, and the primary or election shall be conducted by the poll officers, and the ballots shall be counted and return thereof made in the manner required by law for such method.

       At any time after receiving an official absentee ballot, but before the day of the primary or election, except electors who are confined to a hospital on the day of the primary or election, the elector shall vote his or her absentee ballot, then fold the ballot and enclose and securely seal the same in the envelope on which is printed "Official Absentee Ballot." This envelope shall then be placed in the second one, on which is printed the form of the oath of the elector; the name and oath of the person assisting, if any; and other required identifying information. The elector shall then fill out, subscribe, and swear to the oath printed on such envelope. Such envelope shall then be securely sealed and the elector shall then personally mail or personally deliver same to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk, provided that mailing or delivery may be made by the elector's mother, father, grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, spouse, son, daughter, niece, nephew, grandchild, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, or an individual residing in the household of such elector.

The absentee ballot of an elector who is in custody in a jail or other detention facility may be mailed or delivered by any employee of such jail or facility having custody of such elector. An elector who is confined to a hospital on a primary or election day to whom an absentee ballot is delivered by the registrar or absentee ballot clerk shall then and there vote the ballot, seal it properly, and return it to the registrar or absentee ballot clerk. If the elector registered to vote for the first time in this state by mail and has not previously provided the identification required by Code Section 21-2-220 and votes for the first time by absentee ballot and fails to provide the identification required by Code Section 21-2-220 with such absentee ballot, such absentee ballot shall be treated as a provisional ballot and shall be counted only if the registrars are able to verify the identification and registration of the elector during the time provided pursuant to Code Section 21-2-419.

If an elector has requested to vote by absentee ballot and has not received such absentee ballot, has such ballot in his or her possession, has not yet returned such ballot, or has returned such ballot but the registrars have not received such ballot, such elector may have the absentee ballot canceled and vote in person on the day of the primary, election, or runoff in one of the following ways:

The poll manager shall mark "Canceled" and the date and time across the face of the absentee ballot and shall initial same. The poll manager shall also make appropriate notations beside the name of the elector on the electors list.

After having satisfied themselves as to the identity of such elector and confirming that the elector's absentee ballot has not yet been received by the board of registrars, the registrars or the absentee ballot clerk shall grant the request and shall notify the managers of the elector's precinct as to such action so as to permit the elector to vote in person in that precinct. If the absentee ballot is in the mail, has not yet been returned, or its exact location is unknown, the registrar or the absentee ballot clerk shall write "Canceled" beside the elector's name on the master list of absentee voters and shall cancel the ballot itself as soon as it is received. If the location of the requested absentee ballot is known to the elector and it has not been surrendered to the poll manager, the elector shall destroy the absentee ballot after casting his or her vote in person. Canceled absentee ballots shall be disposed of in the same manner as provided in subsection (a) of Code Section 21-2-386 for absentee ballots returned too late to be cast.

      Applicability of state statutes on party primary.

    <p>
     <p>
    - Whenever a political party holds a primary in this state, it is by law an integral part of the election machinery. Once a decision to hold a primary is made, state statutes take hold and direct every essential step from registration and qualification of voters to the placing of the names of the nominees on the general election ballot. King v. Chapman, 62 F. Supp. 639 (M.D. Ga. 1945), aff'd, 154 F.2d 460 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">327 U.S. 800</cite>, <cite class="s_court">66 S.

    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    It is still the general law of this state that every such primary election shall be held at the time and place and under the regulations prescribed by the rules of the political party holding the primary, and the return shall be made and the result declared as prescribed by law.

In addition, the registrars shall at the same time place in the possession of the managers in each precinct one copy of the list of inactive electors for such precinct.

        - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit found that a Florida electioneering statute was narrowly tailored to protect the compelling state interest of citizens to vote free from intimidation, interference, and fraud, and did not violate the First Amendment by banning exit solicitations about non-ballot issues within 100 feet of polling places; accordingly, the district court abused the court's discretion in granting a preliminary injunction.

Access to such information about an individual provisional ballot shall be restricted to the elector who cast such ballot.

In such event, the ballots cast by electors whose names appear on the electors list for such polling place shall not be considered provisional ballots and shall not require verification as provided by Code Section 21-2-419; provided, however, that persons whose names do not appear on the electors list for such polling place shall vote provisional ballots which shall be subject to verification under Code Section 21-2-419.

The poll officer shall then compare the number of electors voting as shown by the stubs with the number of names shown as voting by the electors list, voter's certificates, and the numbered list of voters, and shall announce the result, and shall enter on the general returns the number of electors who have voted, as shown by the voter's certificates. If any differences exist, they shall be reconciled, if possible; otherwise, they shall be noted on the general returns. The electors list, the voter's certificates, the numbered list of voters, and the stubs of all ballots used, together with all unused ballots, all spoiled and canceled ballots, and all rejected voter's certificates, shall then be placed in separate packages, containers, or envelopes and sealed before the ballot box is opened.

       After the polls close and as soon as all the ballots have been properly accounted for and those outside the ballot box as well as the voter's certificates, numbered list of voters, and electors list have been sealed, the poll officers shall open the ballot box and take therefrom all ballots contained therein. In primaries in which more than one ballot box is used, any ballots or stubs belonging to another party holding its primary in the same polling place shall be returned to the ballot box for the party for which they were issued. In primaries, separate tally and return sheets shall be prepared for each party, and separate poll officers shall be designated by the chief manager to count and tally each party's ballot. Where the same ballot box is being used by one or more parties, the ballots and stubs shall first be divided by party before being tallied and counted. The ballots shall then be counted one by one and a record made of the total number. Then the chief manager, together with such assistant managers and other poll officers as the chief manager may designate, under the scrutiny of one of the assistant managers and in the presence of the other poll officers, shall read aloud the names of the candidates marked or written upon each ballot, together with the office for which the person named is a candidate, and the answers contained on the ballots to the questions submitted, if any; and the other assistant manager and clerks shall carefully enter each vote as read and keep account of the same in ink on a sufficient number of tally papers, all of which shall be made at the same time. All ballots, after being removed from the box, shall be kept within the unobstructed view of all persons in the voting room until replaced in the box. No person, while handling the ballots, shall have in his or her hand any pencil, pen, stamp, or other means of marking or spoiling any ballot. The poll officers shall immediately proceed to canvass and compute the votes cast and shall not adjourn or postpone the canvass or computation until it shall have been fully completed, except that, in the discretion of the superintendent, the poll officers may stop the counting after all contested races and questions are counted, provided that the results of these contested races and questions are posted for the information of the public outside the polling place and the ballots are returned to the ballot box and deposited with the superintendent until counting is resumed on the following day.

       When the vote cast for the different persons named upon the ballots and upon the questions, if any, appearing thereon, shall have been fully recorded in the tally papers and counted, the poll officers shall duly certify to the number of votes cast for each person and question and shall prepare in ink a sufficient number of general returns. The general returns shall show, in addition to the entries made thereon as aforesaid, the total number of ballots received from the superintendent, the number of ballots cast, the number of ballots declared void, the number of ballots spoiled and canceled, and any blank ballots cast, as well as the votes cast for each candidate. At elections, the number of votes cast for each candidate by each political party or body of which such candidate is a nominee shall be separately stated.

       In returning any votes cast for any person whose name is not printed on the ballot, the poll officers shall record any such names exactly as they were written on the ballot.

       Any ballot marked so as to identify the voter shall be void and not counted, except a ballot cast by a challenged elector whose name appears on the electors list; such challenged vote shall be counted as prima facie valid but may be voided in the event of an election contest. Any ballot marked by anything but pen or pencil shall be void and not counted. Any erasure, mutilation, or defect in the vote for any candidate shall render void the vote for such candidate but shall not invalidate the votes cast on the remainder of the ballot, if otherwise properly marked. If an elector shall mark his or her ballot for more persons for any nomination or office than there are candidates to be voted for such nomination or office, or if, for any reason, it may be impossible to determine his or her choice for any nomination or office, his or her ballot shall not be counted for such nomination or office; but the ballot shall be counted for all nominations or offices for which it is properly marked. Unmarked ballots or ballots improperly or defectively marked so that the whole ballot is void shall be set aside and shall be preserved with other ballots. In primaries, votes cast for candidates who have died, withdrawn, or been disqualified shall be void and shall not be counted. In elections, votes for candidates who have died or been disqualified shall be void and shall not be counted.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, if the voter has marked his or her ballot in such a manner that he or she has indicated clearly and without question the candidate which he or she desires to receive his or her vote, his or her ballot shall be counted and such candidate shall receive his vote.

       - The directions as to how a voter should mark a ballot and as to what ballots shall or shall not be counted, though specifically referring to the paper ballot, are declarations of public policy by the legislature. Blackburn v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 392</cite> (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It is the duty of the voter to make the voter's intention clear and certain,
       
       upon pain of having the vote cast out if that does not appear. Blackburn v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 392</cite> (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Unless the ballot clearly demonstrates the voter's intention, those who are charged with the counting and tabulation of ballots should not be called upon to surmise as to what the intent may have been - for they may well come to the wrong conclusion. Blackburn v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 392</cite> (1967).

       <p>
        <p>
       - An "over-vote" occurs when the voter appropriately marks the indicated space at the head of a party column on a ballot, indicating an intention to vote for all of that party's candidates, and also places marks opposite the names of an opposing candidate or candidates, indicating an intent to vote also for them, or when the voter marks a straight party ticket and additionally writes in the name of a candidate for one of the offices for which there is a candidate by that party. Where an over-vote has occurred, as to that office, or those offices, the ballot is invalid, but it is valid as to others. Blackburn v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga.

If either number shall be found not to agree, the envelope shall remain unopened until the poll officers shall have notified the proper custodian of voting machines or the superintendent and until the custodian or some other person authorized by the superintendent shall have presented himself or herself at the polling place for the purpose of reexamining the machine and shall have certified that it is properly arranged. But, if the numbers on the seal and the protective counter or device shall both be found to agree with the numbers on the envelope, the envelope shall be opened, and where the voting machine provided is not equipped with a mechanism for printing paper proof sheets, the poll officers shall examine the registering counters and, for that purpose, shall open the doors concealing such counter, if the construction of the voting machine shall so require; and, before the polls are opened, each manager shall carefully examine every counter and shall see that it registers zero. When the voting machine provided is equipped with a mechanism for printing paper proof sheets and requires the simultaneous use of three keys to unlock the registering counters or counter compartment, the chief manager shall deliver one of the two keys to an assistant manager, to be retained by him or her, and shall then print at least two proof sheets, one of which each manager shall carefully examine to ascertain whether every counter registers zero and shall then preserve such proof sheets to be signed by them and returned to the superintendent, with the duplicate return sheet, and shall sign and post the other proof sheet upon the wall of the polling place, where it shall remain until the polls are closed.

If, upon consideration by the superintendent of the returns and certificates before him or her from any precinct, it shall appear that the total vote returned for any candidate or candidates for the same office or nomination or on any question exceeds the number of electors in such precinct or exceeds the total number of persons who voted in such precinct or the total number of ballots cast therein, such excess shall be deemed a discrepancy and palpable error and shall be investigated by the superintendent; and no votes shall be recorded from such precinct until an investigation shall be had. Such excess shall authorize the summoning of the poll officers to appear immediately with any primary or election papers in their possession. The superintendent shall then examine all the registration and primary or election documents whatever relating to such precinct in the presence of representatives of each party, body, and interested candidate.

If the ballot box is found to contain more ballots than there are electors registered in such precinct or more ballots than the number of voters who voted in such precinct at such primary or election, the superintendent may, in his or her discretion, exclude the poll of that precinct, either as to all offices, candidates, questions, or parties and bodies or as to any particular offices, candidates, questions, or parties and bodies, as to which such excess exists.

Such recount may be held at any time prior to the certification of the consolidated returns by the superintendent and shall be conducted under the direction of the superintendent.

Such recanvass may be conducted at any time prior to the certification of the consolidated returns by the superintendent. In conducting such recanvass, the superintendent shall summon the poll officers of the precinct; and such officers, in the presence of the superintendent, shall make a record of the number of the seal upon the voting machine or machines and the number of the protective counter or other device; shall make visible the registering counters of each such machine; and, without unlocking the machine against voting, shall recanvass the vote thereon. Before making such recanvass, the superintendent shall give notice in writing to the custodian of voting machines, to each candidate, and to the county or municipal chairperson of each party or body affected by the recanvass. Each such candidate may be present in person or by representative, and each of such parties or bodies may send two representatives to be present at such recanvass. If, upon such recanvass, it shall be found that the original canvass of the returns has been correctly made from the machine and that the discrepancy still remains unaccounted for, the superintendent, with the assistance of the custodian, in the presence of the poll officers and the authorized candidates and representatives, shall unlock the voting and counting mechanism of the machine and shall proceed thoroughly to examine and test the machine to determine and reveal the true cause or causes, if any, of the discrepancy in returns from such machine. Each counter shall be reset at zero before it is tested, after which it shall be operated at least 100 times. After the completion of such examination and test, the custodian shall then and there prepare a statement, in writing, giving in detail the result of the examination and test; and such statement shall be witnessed by the persons present and shall be filed with the superintendent. If, upon such recanvass, it shall appear that the original canvass of the returns by the poll officers was incorrect, such returns and all papers being prepared by the superintendent shall be corrected accordingly; provided, however, that in the case of returns from any precinct wherein the primary or election was held by the use of a voting machine equipped with a mechanism for printing paper proof sheets, such proof sheets, if mutually consistent, shall be deemed to be prima-facie evidence of the result of the primary or election and to be prima facie accurate; and there shall not be considered to be any discrepancy or error in the returns from any such precinct, such as to require a recanvass of the vote, if all available proof sheets, from the voting machine used therein, identified to the satisfaction of the superintendent and shown to his or her satisfaction to have been produced from proper custody, shall be mutually consistent; and, if the general and duplicate returns, or either of such returns from such precincts shall not correspond with such proof sheets, they and all other papers being prepared by the superintendent shall be corrected so as to correspond with such proof sheets in the absence of allegation of specific fraud or error proved to the satisfaction of the superintendent by the weight of the evidence; and only in such case shall the vote of such precinct be recanvassed under this Code section.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court did not err in granting the Secretary of State, the Governor, and the Georgia State Election Board summary judgment in voters' action challenging the use of direct recording electronic equipment because tangible ballots with custodial linkage to individual voters were not an absolute requirement for every voting system; although the recount law does not specifically set out recount procedures for electronic voting systems, it does clearly recognize that recount procedures for paper ballots necessarily differ from recanvassing procedures for mechanical voting machines.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the findings and report of the recount committee are final and conclusive as to all questions respecting the validity of a primary election, any subsequent attempt by the party's executive committee to entertain and hear a contest between the parties involved is an absolute nullity for want of authority to do so. Middleton v. Moody, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 237</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 567</cite> (1960); Hamilton v.

        <p>
       - When the executive committee or other authority conducting and holding a primary election for the nomination of its candidates fails or refuses to adopt, promulgate, publish, and certify to the proper authorities the findings and report of a recount committee, then the candidate whose rights may be affected by the failure or refusal has a right to proceed by mandamus to enforce the findings and report, and there is jurisdiction in the superior courts of this state to hear and determine the cause, notwithstanding the political nature of the controversy.

If the municipal charter or ordinances of a municipality as now existing or as amended subsequent to September 1, 1968, provide that a candidate may be nominated or elected by a plurality of the votes cast to fill such nomination or public office, such provision shall prevail. Otherwise, no municipal candidate shall be nominated for public office in any primary or elected to public office in any election unless such candidate shall have received a majority of the votes cast to fill such nomination or public office.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-501ol1c">
       In instances in which no municipal candidate receives a majority of the votes cast and the municipal charter or ordinances do not provide for nomination or election by a plurality vote, a run-off primary or election shall be held between the candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes. Such runoff shall be held on the twenty-eighth day after the day of holding the first primary or election, unless such run-off date is postponed by court order; provided, however, that, in the case of a runoff from a municipal special election that is held in conjunction with a special election for a federal office and not in conjunction with a general primary or general election, the municipality may conduct such runoff from such municipal special election on the date of the special election runoff for the federal office. Only the electors entitled to vote in the first primary or election shall be entitled to vote in any run-off primary or election resulting therefrom; provided, however, that no elector shall vote in a run-off primary in violation of Code Section 21-2-216. The run-off primary or election shall be a continuation of the first primary or election, and only those votes cast for the candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes in the first primary or election shall be counted. No write-in votes may be cast in such a primary, run-off primary, or run-off election. If any candidate eligible to be in a runoff withdraws, dies, or is found to be ineligible, the remaining candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes shall be the candidates in such runoff. The municipal candidate receiving the highest number of the votes cast in such run-off primary or run-off election to fill the nomination or public office sought shall be declared the winner. The municipality shall give written notice to the Secretary of State of such runoff as soon as such municipality certifies the preceding primary, special primary, election, or special election.

       In all cities having a population in excess of 100,000 according to the United States decennial census of 1980 or any future such census, in order for a municipal candidate to be nominated for public office in any primary or elected to public office in any municipal election, he or she must receive a majority of the votes cast.

      <li id="t21c02s21-2-501ol1f">
       Except for presidential electors, to be elected to public office in a general election, a candidate must receive a majority of the votes cast in an election to fill such public office. To be elected to the office of presidential electors, no slate of candidates shall be required to receive a majority of the votes cast, but that slate of candidates shall be elected to such office which receives the highest number of votes cast.

       - Although subsection (a) specifies only death and withdrawal as events which trigger a special election, it seems clear that the General Assembly meant, by withdrawal, any voluntary vacating of the position to which one had been elected and the ordinary, logical means by which an incumbent voluntarily leaves office is by resignation. Therefore, if subsection (a) is to serve its intended purpose, its language must be construed to encompass resignations. Duncan v. Poythress, 515 F. Supp. 327 (N.D.

     Georgia Election Code provides liberal rules for the contesting of elections and strict penalties for violations.

      State courts have jurisdiction to recount ballots cast in congressional contests.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - The courts of this state have jurisdiction of a proceeding brought under the provisions of the Georgia Election Code to obtain a recount of all or a portion of the ballots cast in an election for a representative to either house in the Congress. Blackburn v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 392</cite> (1967).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     To cast doubt on an election it is only necessary to show:
    
    (1) electors voted in the particular contest being challenged; and (2) a sufficient number of them were not qualified to vote so as to cast doubt on the election. Taggart v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 454</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 245</cite>, later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 484</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 268</cite> (1978).

     <p>
    - A challenge to primary election results by an unsuccessful candidate was moot and subject to dismissal where the candidate did not seek to advance case so that the candidate's challenge was docketed and considered before the general election. Payne v. Chatman, <cite class="ga_court">267 Ga. 873</cite>, <cite class="app_court">485 S.E.2d 723</cite> (1997); Caplan v.

       - In an election contest, the trial court did not err in denying an incumbent's motion to dismiss a challenger's lawsuit merely because that challenger failed to name the Board of Registration and Elections as the proper party defendant, as the failure to name the proper parties was an amendable defect, correctable by the parties or upon the court's own motion.

       - Trial court properly denied a losing candidate's petition to contest the election results of a mayoral election held in a town as the losing candidate failed to meet the burden of establishing that any misconduct, fraud, or irregularity occurred that placed the result of the election in doubt based on the county clerk signing the document reflecting the election results, instead of the election superintendent, and the clerk's failure to purge the voters list, which was not an obligation of the election supervisor anyway. The omission of the statutory language providing directions on how to cast a vote likewise did not necessitate a new election since the poll manager testified that the poll manager and other poll workers instructed each voter how to fill out the ballot and established that there was no concern or confusion by the voters regarding the ballot. Lewis v. O'Day, <cite class="ga_court">284 Ga. 423</cite>, <cite class="app_court">667 S.E.2d 594</cite> (2008).

      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for the purposes of election contests, a vote cast by a person who has been listed on the official list of electors for a period of ten years or longer shall be rebuttably presumed to be a legal vote despite an unsigned voter registration card, so long as that person continues to meet the eligibility requirements of Code Section 21-2-216.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c02s21-2-524" target="_self">21-2-524</a></cite> and other statutory provisions, the General Assembly has expressed an intent that the public inform itself of the accuracy of the voting process.

        Burden is on the complaining party
       
       to affirmatively show that facially valid results are invalid due to an irregularity sufficient to place the entire election in doubt. Johnson v. Rheney, <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 872</cite> (1980).

        Election challenger's timely filed election contest, filed after the election, was erroneously dismissed,
       
       as such was not moot merely because the challenger failed to file the contest prior to the election, given that no statutory provision or case law supported this proposition, and the petition sufficiently stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. Allen v. Yost, <cite class="ga_court">281 Ga. 102</cite>, <cite class="app_court">636 S.E.2d 517</cite> (2006), appeal dismissed, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 865</cite>, <cite class="app_court">655 S.E.2d 580</cite> (2008).

        It is unnecessary for the contestant to plead the details of the evidence

       <p>
        <p>
       - Charges that more ballots were found in the box at precincts than the number of persons listed by the holders of the election as having voted, or that less ballots were found in one box than the number of people who had voted in that precinct, amounted to serious charges of fraud in the holding of the election. The charges were as definite and full as could be expected in this situation and were sufficient to raise the question as to whether the election has been conducted in a manner so illegally, fraudulently, and unfairly as to fall under condemnation of the law. Bush v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">143 S.E.2d 21</cite> (1965).

       <p>
        <p>
       - In an election contest because the contestor did not present any evidence showing a factual basis to establish fraud by casting doubt on the counting of a single vote, but instead presented web site information, which had nothing to do with any miscounting of votes or the mishandling of any absentee ballots, such evidence was insufficient to support an election contest. Davis v. Dunn, <cite class="ga_court">286 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">690 S.E.2d 389</cite> (2010).

        Sections of the former Code provided an adequate remedy at law for a contestant

       - The five-day period for filing an election contest begins after the results are certified by the Secretary of State, not after each county certifies its results. Hammill v. Valentine, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 9</cite> (1988).

       When there is a recount, the five-day period to contest an election begins to run from the date of the certification of the recount by the Secretary of State, not from the certification of the election. Hammill v. Valentine, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 9</cite> (1988).

       Trial court erred in finding that the State Election Board was not properly served with process of an election candidate's challenge to an election contest; but, the candidate's failure to effect timely service of appropriate process of the contest against the mayor-elect required dismissal of the suit. Swain v. Thompson, <cite class="ga_court">281 Ga. 30</cite>, <cite class="app_court">635 S.E.2d 779</cite> (2006).
       </p>

        <p>
       Trial court did not err in dismissing the candidates' petition contesting a general election on the ground that the petition was not filed within five days after the official consolidation of the returns and certification thereof pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   ยง
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c02s21-2-524ol1a" target="_self">21-2-524(a)</a></cite>. When the board certified the election results on November 7, the candidates had through November 12 to file a petition, but, since they did not file the petition until November 17, the trial court was without jurisdiction to decide the merits of the election contest, and the trial court's finding that the date of certification was November 7 was supported by evidence that, on that date, the chairman of the county board of elections signed the certification form on the only signature line provided for the superintendent; although each plaintiff has five days in which to file a petition challenging an election, O.C.G.A.
   ยง
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c02s21-2-524ol1a" target="_self">21-2-524(a)</a></cite> clearly permits different filing dates for different races in any given election, depending on when the appropriate party certifies the results for the "particular office" at issue. Broughton v. Douglas County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="ga_court">286 Ga. 528</cite>, <cite class="app_court">690 S.E.2d 141</cite> (2010).
       </p>

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c02s21-2-524ol1a" target="_self">21-2-524(a)</a></cite> for filing a petition to contest the election results for a county office began to run when the county superintendent had officially consolidated and certified the returns for the particular office; because the Secretary of State only certifies election returns for federal and state offices, the sole election official specified in the Georgia Code as having responsibility for consolidation and certification of election results for other offices is the local superintendent. Broughton v. Douglas County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="ga_court">286 Ga. 528</cite>, <cite class="app_court">690 S.E.2d 141</cite> (2010).

       Election Code does not provide that a mandatory recount and re-certification of the results in one race require re-certification of the results in other races and a second opportunity to contest such other elections; the apparent loser of the race that is the subject of the recount must be given five days after re-certification in which to challenge the election, but the exception to measurement of the five-day period from the date of initial certification does not apply to candidates whose races were not subject to a recount, who have remained the apparent losers since certification of their races, and who have therefore already had a real opportunity to challenge the election within five days after certification of the initial count. Broughton v. Douglas County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="ga_court">286 Ga. 528</cite>, <cite class="app_court">690 S.E.2d 141</cite> (2010).

       - Even though laches operated independently of any statute of limitations, courts of equity usually acted in obedience and in analogy to the statutes of limitations in cases where it would not have been unjust and inequitable to have done so; laches was properly applied to bar a suit seeking an injunction against a tax which was filed 42 days after the election approving the tax.

       - When the presiding judicial officer hearing a contested election case issued a fi. fa. for costs and the evidence of the defendant's liability was conflicting, the judge of the superior court did not abuse judicial discretion in issuing, upon petition, a restraining order against execution of the fi. fa. until a hearing could be held on the issues raised by the pleadings.

       In a case contesting the result of a primary or election held in two or more counties, each issue to be tried by a jury shall be tried by a jury impaneled in the county where such issue or a part thereof arose. Such jury shall be impaneled by the superior court of the county in which the jury trial is to be conducted; such trial shall be presided over by the judge as described in Code Section 21-2-523; and such trial shall proceed, insofar as practicable, as though it were being conducted in the county of the superior court having jurisdiction of the contest.

       In a case contesting the result of a primary or election held within a single county, the court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact. In a case contesting the result of a primary or election held in two or more counties, the court shall require each jury impaneled to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact. In a case where a special verdict is to be rendered, the court shall submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer or may submit written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate. The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue. If, in so doing, the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his or her right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires he or she demands its submission to the jury. As to an issue omitted without such demand, the court may make a finding; or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.

       - If the contestant can sustain the charges, or enough of them to cast doubt upon whether the election was fairly and lawfully conducted, it should be voided and another held. If the contestant cannot, the election should stand. Nichols v. Acree, <cite class="ga_app_court">112 Ga. App. 287</cite>, <cite class="app_court">145 S.E.2d 92</cite> (1965).

         Appeal of contestant to city council election dismissed as moot.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The appeal of a contestant to a city council election was dismissed as moot because the contestant failed to move to expedite consideration of an appeal in view of an impending election, and the Supreme Court of Georgia finally heard the appeal after the election had already occurred and the term of office for the seat at issue had expired. Allen v. Yost, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 865</cite>, <cite class="app_court">655 S.E.2d 580</cite> (2008).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Because the losing party to an election as the party seeking review of an election for representative to the Griffin-Spalding County board of education had the obligation to exercise the mechanisms available to produce a timely result, specifically by seeking a stay of the trial court's order to maintain the status quo or request an order of supersedeas, an appeal from the trial court's order denying a challenge to the election results was dismissed as moot. Kendall v. Delaney, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 482</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 685</cite> (2007).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Because the record showed that an unsuccessful candidate in a primary election waited nearly a month and a half to challenge that election, request a stay of the general election, or petition the Supreme Court of Georgia for an expedited appeal, the mootness doctrine applied to the challenge requiring dismissal of the appeal. McCreary v. Martin, <cite class="ga_court">281 Ga. 668</cite>, <cite class="app_court">642 S.E.2d 80</cite> (2007).

The provisions of this Act shall apply with respect to an incumbent public official where the act or omission constituting grounds for recall, as specified in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (7) of Code Section 21-4-3, occurred in a previous term of office but was withheld from public knowledge or public disclosure until subsequent to the general election at which the incumbent was last elected, provided that an application for a recall petition is filed within 12 months after such general election." This Act became effective April 19, 1989.

       - A city commissioner's removal from office, based on acts committed prior to taking office, was erroneous because: (1) removal was not authorized by the city's charter; (2) the commissioner's conduct of maintaining innocence until the entry of a guilty plea after taking office was not an official act or one done under the color of the office; and (3) the acts committed did not prevent the commissioner from performing the duties of that post. Moreover, while the acts committed did not subject the commissioner to removal pursuant to the terms of the city charter, the acts would have been more appropriately the subject of a recall petition pursuant to O.C.G.A.

      The General Assembly finds that the electorate of the state overwhelmingly ratified an amendment to the Constitution of Georgia at the general election in November, 1978, authorizing the General Assembly to provide by general law for uniform and exclusive procedures to recall public officials who hold elective office and to repeal all local recall laws and prohibit the future enactment of any local recall laws. In furtherance of the mandate of the electorate, by this general law the General Assembly establishes uniform and exclusive procedures relating to the recall of all state and local officials who hold elective office.

       Within four days after the date of submission of the application for a recall petition for verification, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, the officer sought to be recalled may file a petition in the superior court of the county in which such officer is domiciled applying for a review of the sufficiency of the ground or grounds for the recall and the fact or facts upon which such ground or grounds are based as set forth in such recall application.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c04s21-4-6ol1b">
       The superior court having jurisdiction of a case governed by this chapter shall be presided over by a superior court judge or senior judge.The superior court judge or senior judge who presides over the case shall be selected as set out in subsection (c) of this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c04s21-4-6ol1c">
       Upon the filing of a sufficiency review petition under this Code section, the clerk of superior court having jurisdiction shall immediately notify the administrative judge for the judicial administrative district in which that county lies, or the district court administrator, who shall immediately notify the administrative judge of the institution of proceedings under this chapter.If the county in which the proceedings were instituted is not in the circuit of the administrative judge, the administrative judge shall select a superior court judge from within the district, but not from the circuit in which the proceeding was instituted, or a senior judge who is not a resident of the circuit in which the proceeding was instituted, to preside over the contest.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c04s21-4-6ol1d">
       If the administrative judge is a member of the circuit in which the proceeding was filed, or if the other judges of the district are unable or are unwilling to preside over the proceeding, or if the other judges of the district are judges of the circuit in which the proceeding was filed, then the administrative judge shall select an administrative judge of an adjoining district to select a superior court judge from that district, or a superior court judge from the district in which the proceeding was filed, but not the circuit in which the proceeding was filed, or a senior judge who is not a resident of the circuit wherein the proceeding was filed.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c04s21-4-6ol1e">
       After a judge has agreed to preside over the case, the administrative judge who selected the judge to hear the matter shall enter an order in the superior court of the county where the proceeding was filed appointing such judge, and such judge shall promptly begin presiding over such proceedings in such court and shall determine same as soon as practicable. Such judge shall be reimbursed for his actual expenses for food and lodging and shall receive the same mileage as any other state officials and employees. Senior judges shall be entitled to compensation and reimbursement as the law provides for senior judge service.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c04s21-4-6ol1f">
       Such review shall be limited solely to a review of the legal sufficiency of the recall ground or grounds and the legal sufficiency of the alleged fact or facts upon which such ground or grounds are based as set forth in such recall application. The review of such alleged fact or facts shall include a determination of whether probable cause exists to believe that such alleged fact or facts are true. The burden shall be on the petition chairperson to prove that such probable cause exists. The judge shall consider such review petitions on an expedited basis. Discovery shall be permitted but shall not delay the consideration of the review petition by the judge. The judge may enter such orders as the judge deems necessary and appropriate to expedite any discovery and the consideration of the review petition.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c04s21-4-6ol1g">
       During the pendency of the review by the superior court, all other recall proceedings shall be suspended. If a ruling of sufficiency is rendered by such judge, then recall proceedings shall continue in the manner provided for in this chapter. The time for circulating a recall petition after the review of the sufficiency petition shall begin from the date of the order of the superior court or the issuance of recall petition forms, whichever is later, notwithstanding the fact that recall petition forms were issued before the filing of the petition for review of the sufficiency of the recall application. Valid signatures obtained on a recall petition prior to the filing of a petition for review of the sufficiency of a recall application shall be counted. The officer sought to be recalled may file a discretionary appeal in the Supreme Court of Georgia within ten days after the date of an order finding a recall application sufficient, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, and such court shall consider such appeal on an expedited basis. The filing of such appeal shall not operate to stay the recall proceedings. If a ruling of insufficiency is rendered by such judge, then a discretionary appeal may be filed in the Supreme Court of Georgia within ten days after the date of such ruling, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, and such court shall consider such appeal on an expedited basis.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - To determine if the "fact or facts upon which such ground or grounds are based" are legally sufficient, a court should consider the following: 1) assuming the fact or facts to be true, do they allege misconduct which constitutes a legally sufficient ground for recall according to the statutory definition of that term; 2) if so, are the fact or facts stated with "reasonable particularity." Brooks v. Branch, <cite class="ga_court">262 Ga. 658</cite>, <cite class="app_court">424 S.E.2d 277</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since the factual allegations were either a mere conclusion, lacking reasonable particularity, or failed to allege conduct which would constitute one of the statutory grounds for recall, they were legally insufficient to support grounds for recall. Brooks v. Branch, <cite class="ga_court">262 Ga. 658</cite>, <cite class="app_court">424 S.E.2d 277</cite> (1993).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because neither discovery nor an evidentiary hearing is permitted at the review stage of the recall proceedings, it is imperative that the application state with clarity and specificity the facts supporting the grounds for recall such that both the public and the official sought to be recalled are properly notified of the violation alleged to have been committed. The standard for determining the "legal sufficiency" of a factual allegation is whether it states "with reasonable particularity a ground for recall." Davis v. Shavers, <cite class="ga_court">263 Ga. 785</cite>, <cite class="app_court">439 S.E.2d 650</cite> (1994).

       - Trial court did not err in applying the "reasonable grounds" definition of probable cause in determining whether there was probable cause to believe that the factual allegations in a recall application were true.

     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of this state, in furtherance of its responsibility to protect the integrity of the democratic process and to ensure fair elections for constitutional offices; state offices; district attorneys; members of the Georgia House of Representatives and Georgia Senate; all constitutional judicial officers; and all county and municipal elected officials, to institute and establish a requirement of public disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures relative to the seeking of such offices, to the recall of public officers holding elective office, and to the influencing of voter approval or rejection of a proposed constitutional amendment, a state-wide referendum, or a proposed question which is to appear on the ballot in any county or municipal election. Further, it is the policy of this state that the state's public affairs will be best served by disclosures of significant private interests of public officers and officials which may influence the discharge of their public duties and responsibilities. The General Assembly further finds that it is for the public to determine whether significant private interests of public officers have influenced the state's public officers to the detriment of their public duties and responsibilities and, in order to make that determination and hold the public officers accountable, the public must have reasonable access to the disclosure of the significant private interests of the public officers of this state.

       - The mere appointment, by a member of the legislative branch, of a nonlegislator to an executive commission, such as the State Campaign and Financial Disclosure Committee (now State Ethics Commission), is not a simultaneous discharge of duties and functions against which the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers is directed. Caldwell v. Bateman, <cite class="ga_court">252 Ga. 144</cite>, <cite class="app_court">312 S.E.2d 320</cite> (1984) (decided under the former chapter).

        - The incumbent of a covered office who receives campaign contributions or makes campaign expenditures during nonelection years must report the transactions, both in the incumbent's supplemental report and in the initial report during the calendar year in which an election for the office the incumbent holds occurs. 1977 Op.

       <p>
        - The filing dates which the former chapter specified for campaign financing disclosure reports are of general applicability and are ordinarily not affected by the method or procedures used by a "candidate" to seek office, but the "15 days prior to the general election" filing date applies only to those candidates in the general election campaign. 1976 Op.

       <p>
        - While a write-in candidate who has in fact filed a notice of intention of candidacy prior to any of the fiscal disclosure report filing dates surrounding the primary must comply with those report requirements occurring after the individual has become a candidate, and while an individual who intends to subsequently become a write-in candidate should file such reports, the practical consequence is probably that only those reporting dates fixed with respect to the general election can be enforced against a write-in candidate. 1976 Op.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this article, a contribution to a campaign committee of a candidate for any public office shall be deemed to be a contribution to such candidate. If during any calendar year there occur both a special election including a special primary, special primary runoff, and special election runoff as appropriate and a general election for the same public office and if the same person is a candidate for nomination or election at both such special election including a special primary, special primary runoff, and special election runoff as appropriate and such general election, then this Code section shall apply. Where this Code section applies, a person, corporation, political committee, or political party may contribute up to the maximum amount otherwise allowable under this article to such person or such person's campaign committee for the purpose of influencing such candidate's nomination or election at the special primary, special primary runoff, special election, or special election runoff; and the same person, corporation, political committee, or political party may contribute up to the maximum amount otherwise allowable under this article for the purpose of influencing such candidate's election at the general election or general election runoff. This Code section shall be construed according to the following rules:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t21c05s21-5-42ol11">
       It is the general intent of this Code section to allow a person who is a candidate for election at both a special election and a general election in the same calendar year to receive up to but no more than twice the amount of contributions which could otherwise be received from any one donor during the year; and
      </li>
      <li id="t21c05s21-5-42ol12">
       Seeking nomination at a special primary or general primary shall be considered as seeking election at the ensuing special election or general election for the purpose of determining whether a person is a candidate for election at both the special election and the general election and allowing the application of this Code section; but seeking election at only a single primary and its ensuing election shall not bring this Code section into effect.

       - The definition of lobbying which proscribed only contact "not addressed solely to the judgment" of a member of the General Assembly meant activity aimed at overcoming the independent judgment of a legislator through favors, promises, and the like, rather than honest attempts to persuade the legislator to adopt a specific point of view in the exercise of the legislator's independent judgment.

       - The expenditure of tax moneys by a political subdivision to influence the citizens and voters of that political subdivision was far different from the expenditure of tax moneys to inform and influence the General Assembly on behalf of these citizens and voters in regard to issues involving the respective political subdivision; the expenditure by a political subdivision of public money to influence the citizens and voters of the entity contained within it the possibility of the corrupt use of influence to perpetuate a local administrator's power.
