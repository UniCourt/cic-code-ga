      The Commissioner shall adopt such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to promote the enforcement of this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall have the force and effect of law and shall have state-wide application as being the state minimum fire safety standards and shall not require adoption by a municipality or county. The governing authority of any municipality or county in this state is authorized to enforce the state minimum fire safety standards on all buildings and structures except one-family and two-family dwellings and those buildings and structures listed in Code Section 25-2-13.All other applications of the state minimum fire safety standards and fees are specified in Code Sections 25-2-4.1, 25-2-12, and 25-2-12.1.Before the Commissioner shall adopt as a part of his rules and regulations for the enforcement of this chapter any of the principles of the various codes referred to in this chapter, he shall first consider and approve them as reasonably suitable for the enforcement of this chapter. Not less than 15 days before any rules and regulations are promulgated, a public hearing shall be held. Notice of the hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation.

In particular, but not by way of limitation upon the authority granted in this Code section, the Commissioner may bring an action to enjoin any construction found to be in contravention of Code Section 25-2-13 or 25-2-14 or to obtain an order of court directing the immediate evacuation and the secure closure of any structure which, by reason of violation of any provision of this chapter or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commissioner under this chapter, is found to pose an immediate threat to the property, health, or lives of the occupants of the structure. In order to avail himself of the remedies provided for in this Code section, it shall not be necessary for the Commissioner to allege or to prove the absence of an adequate remedy at law.

      With the exception of the benefit under subdivision (B)(ii)(I) of this paragraph, any person who was simultaneously a member of more than one fire department at the time of diagnosis shall not be entitled to receive benefits under this paragraph from or on behalf of more than one of such fire departments. In the event a volunteer of one fire department is simultaneously employed by another fire department, the fire department for which such person is a volunteer shall not be required to maintain the coverage on such volunteer otherwise required under this subsection during the period of such employment. Any member who receives benefits under division (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may be required to have his or her condition reevaluated; in the event any such reevaluation reveals that such person has regained the ability to perform duties as a firefighter, then his or her benefits under division (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall cease. Benefits under said division shall also cease upon the death of such person. A member who, after at least one year as a firefighter, departs from employment, ceases to be an active volunteer, or retires shall be entitled to continue his or her coverages under this paragraph through a continuation or conversion to individual coverage. The departing member shall be responsible for payment of all premiums.

      For the purposes of this chapter, the term "jurisdiction" means a federal agency, a state agency, a local governmental subdivision of this state or an adjoining state, or an industrial or private organization which has established a fire-fighting department that is responsible for fire protection services within the area under the control, supervision, or management of the specific "jurisdiction." A "jurisdiction" may be one of the following, but is not limited to the following: towns, cities, counties outside corporate limits, industrial complexes, specific fire protection areas, military bases, private fire departments, volunteer fire departments, and the like.

     <p>
      Whenever two or more jurisdictions, as defined by Code Section 25-6-1, within or adjacent to this state, by written resolution authorize their respective fire departments to render aid and assistance in the extinguishment of fires or other immediate response emergencies outside of their respective jurisdictions, they may, if they so desire, form a district mutual aid system or pact, which shall be a public corporation. It is the primary intent that such system or pact be established for fire emergencies; however, due to the diverse emergency services expected of fire departments, mutual aid systems or pacts may include responses for any form of immediate response emergency as specified by members of the system or pact. Members of fire departments of member jurisdictions shall be considered as officers of a public municipal corporation and shall enjoy the privileges, rights, exemptions, immunities, and duties of such; and this shall apply to paid, volunteer, or private members when responding to or returning from rendering aid in an emergency under a mutual aid system or a pact. As used in this chapter, "pact" means a mutual aid resource pact.

Upon receipt of at least two resolutions, the state fire marshal or his authorized representative shall call the first organizational meeting of the system by giving notice to all persons designated by the resolutions to act for potential member jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction shall send its designated person or his authorized representative to the organizational and subsequent meetings. Such person shall be entitled to one vote in all proceedings.

Member jurisdictions shall adopt the training programs of the Georgia Fire Academy in order to ensure a basic standardization of operations and philosophy; this requirement shall not be construed as limiting the training practices or requirements of any jurisdiction, as it is intended that the programs of the Georgia Fire Academy be used to supplement the training practices and requirements of member jurisdictions.

       - When an asphalt company admitted that the company had been "scraping" a site where a telephone cable was severed, and telephone company employees testified it appeared that there had been digging at the site where the cable was severed, the evidence was sufficient to support the Georgia Public Service Commission's conclusion that the company violated the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act, O.C.G.A.

      The advisory committee shall establish rules of operation including an attendance policy. In the event a committee member resigns or fails to meet the criteria of the attendance policy, the advisory committee shall appoint an interim member to represent the same stakeholder group until such time as the Governor appoints a replacement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The advisory committee shall assist the commission in the enforcement of this chapter, make recommendations to the commission regarding rules and regulations, and perform duties to be assigned by the commission including, but not limited to, the review of reported violations of this chapter and the preparation of recommendations to the commission as to the appropriate penalties to impose on persons violating the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The members of the advisory committee shall be immune, individually and jointly, from civil liability for any act or omission done or made in the performance of their duties while serving as members of such advisory committee, but only in the absence of willful misconduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Commission enforcement of this chapter shall follow the procedures described in this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the commission delegated from the federal government and authorized in other state law.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A) The commission is not authorized to impose civil penalties on any local governing authority except as provided in this paragraph. The commission may recommend training for local governing authorities in response to any probable or proven violation. Civil penalties may be recommended for or imposed on any local governing authority for refusal to comply with the requirements of Code Section 25-9-7 or for other violations of Code Section 25-9-7 that result in injury to people, damage to property, or the interruption of utility service in the event that investigators find that a local governing authority has demonstrated a pattern of willful noncompliance. Civil penalties may be recommended or imposed on or after January 1, 2006, for violations of provisions of this chapter other than Code Section 25-9-7 in the event that investigators find that the severity of an excavation violation warrants civil penalties or that a local governing authority has demonstrated a pattern of willful noncompliance. Any such civil penalty shall be recommended or imposed in accordance with a tiered penalty structure designed for local governing authorities. In the event that the investigators determine that a local governing authority has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, the investigators shall not recommend a civil penalty. For purposes of this subsection "refusal to comply" means that a utility facility owner or operator does not respond in PRIS to a locate request, does not respond to a direct telephone call to designate their facilities, or other such direct refusal. Refusal to comply does not mean a case where the volume of requests or some other mitigating circumstance prevents the utility owner or operator from locating in accordance with Code Section 25-9-7.
     </p>
     <p>
      No later than January 1, 2006, the advisory committee shall recommend to the commission for adoption a tiered penalty structure for local governing authorities. Such structure shall take into account the size, annual budget, gross receipts, number of utility connections and types of utilities within the territory of the local governing authority. Such penalty structure shall also take into account the number of locate requests received annually by the local governing authority, the number of locate codes made annually to the local governing authority from the UPC, the number of utility customers whose service may have been interrupted by violations of this chapter, and the duration of such interruptions. Such penalty structure shall also consider the cost of compliance. The penalty structure shall establish for each tier the maximum penalty per violation and per 12 month period at a level to induce compliance with this chapter. Such maximum penalty shall not exceed $5,000.00 per violation or $50,000.00 per 12 month period for the highest tier.
     </p>
     <p>
      If commission investigators find that a probable violation has occurred, they may recommend training in lieu of penalties to any person for any violation. The commission shall provide suggestions for corrective action to any person requesting such assistance. Commission investigators shall make recommended findings or offers of settlement to the respondent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any respondent may accept or disagree with the settlement recommended by the investigators. If the respondent disagrees with the recommended settlement, the respondent may dispute the settlement recommendation to the advisory committee. The advisory committee shall then render a recommendation either supporting the investigators' recommendation, rejecting the investigators' recommendation, or substituting its own recommendation. With respect to an investigation of any probable violation committed by a local governing authority, any recommendation by the advisory committee shall be in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. In its deliberations the advisory committee shall consider the gravity of the violation or violations; the degree of the respondent's culpability; the respondent's history of prior offenses; and such other mitigating factors as may be appropriate. If the advisory committee determines that a respondent has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, the committee shall not recommend civil penalties against the respondent. To the extent that a respondent does not accept a settlement agreement or request to dispute the recommendation of the investigators to the advisory committee, the respondent shall be assigned to a hearing officer or administrative law judge.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any respondent disagrees with the recommendation of the advisory committee, after notice and hearing by a hearing officer or administrative law judge, such officer or judge shall make recommendations to the commission regarding enforcement, including civil penalties. Any such recommendations relating to a local governing authority shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. The acceptance of the recommendations by the respondent at any point will stop further action by the investigators in that case.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the respondent agrees with the advisory committee recommendation, the investigators shall present such agreement to the commission. The commission is then authorized to adopt the recommendation of the advisory committee regarding a civil penalty, or to reject such a recommendation. The commission is not authorized to impose a civil penalty greater than the civil penalty recommended by the advisory committee or to impose any civil penalty if the advisory committee does not recommend a civil penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may, by judgment entered after a hearing on notice duly served on any person not less than 30 days before the date of the hearing, impose a civil penalty not exceeding $10,000.00 for each violation, if it is proved that the person violated any of the provisions of this chapter as a result of a failure to exercise additional care in accordance with subsection (d) of Code Section 25-9-8 or reasonable care in accordance with other provisions of this chapter. Any such recommendations relating to a local governing authority shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. Any proceeding or civil penalty undertaken pursuant to this Code section shall neither prevent nor preempt the right of any party to obtain civil damages for personal injury or property damage in private causes of action except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

Such term does not include local building officials, fire inspectors, or insurance inspectors when acting in their official capacities.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-11-2ol15">
       "Fire protection sprinkler contractor license" means the document issued by the Commissioner to the fire protection sprinkler contractor which authorizes the fire protection sprinkler contractor to engage in the business of fabrication, installation, repair, alteration, maintenance, or inspection of water-based fire protection systems.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-11-2ol16">
       "Fire protection sprinkler system" means an integrated system of overhead and underground piping designed in accordance with fire protection engineering standards. The installation includes one or more automatic water supplies. The portion of the system aboveground is a network of specially sized or hydraulically designed piping installed in a building, structure, or area, generally overhead, to which sprinklers are attached in a systematic pattern. The valve controlling each system riser is located in the system riser or its supply piping. The system is usually activated by heat from a fire and discharges water over the fire area.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-11-2ol17">
       "Fire protection system designer" means a person who develops documents pertaining to water-based fire protection systems.

System operation arrangements parallel those for foam-water sprinkler systems.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-11-2ol113">
       "Foam-water sprinkler system" means a special system pipe connected to a source of foam concentrates and to a water supply and equipped with appropriate discharge devices for fire protection agent discharge and distribution over the area to be protected. The piping system is connected to the water supply through a control valve that is usually actuated by operation of automatic detection equipment installed in the same area as the sprinklers. When this valve opens, water flows into the piping system, and foam concentrate is injected into the water. The resulting foam solution discharging through the discharge devices generates and distributes foam. Upon exhaustion of the foam concentrate supply, water discharge will follow the foam and continue until manually shut off. Existing deluge sprinkler systems that have been converted to the use of aqueous film forming foam are classified as foam-water sprinkler systems.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-11-2ol114">
       "Inspection" means a visual examination of a water-based fire protection system or portion thereof to verify that it appears to be in operating condition and is free of physical damage.

This is accomplished by connection to water supply systems or by pumps, tanks, and other equipment necessary to provide an adequate supply of water-to-hose connections.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-11-2ol119">
       "Testing" means a procedure to determine the status of a system as intended by conducting periodic physical checks on water-based fire protection systems such as waterflow tests, fire pump tests, alarm tests, and trip tests of dry pipe, deluge, or preaction valves. These tests follow up on the original acceptance test at intervals specified in the appropriate standards related to such systems.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-11-2ol120">
       "Water-based fire protection system" means any one system or any combination of a number of systems designed to deliver water to an apparatus designed to extinguish or retard the advancement of fire. Such systems include fire protection sprinkler systems, standpipe systems, private fire service mains, fire pumps, private water tanks, water spray fixed systems, foam-water spray systems, and foam-water sprinkler systems. The term "fire sprinkler system" is used interchangeably with this term.

      It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any municipal, county, or volunteer fire department or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the municipal, county, or volunteer fire department or a member thereof. Furthermore, the municipal, county, or volunteer fire department, which provides quality fire protection and safety services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the department, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any municipal, county, or volunteer fire department's name or any term used to identify the department or its members without the expressed permission of the local governing body. The provisions of this chapter are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.

         All scaffolding or staging that is swung or suspended from an overhead support or erected with stationary supports and is suspended or rises 30 feet or more above the ground shall have a safety rail properly attached, bolted, braced, and otherwise secured; and the safety rail shall rise at least 34 inches above the floor or main portions of such scaffolding or staging and extend for the full length of such staging and along the ends thereof with only such openings as may be necessary for the delivery of materials being used on such scaffold or staging. Such scaffolding or staging shall also be so fastened as to prevent it from swaying from the building or structure. However, this paragraph shall not apply to any scaffolding or staging which is wholly within the interior of a building or other structure and which covers the entire floor space therein.

         It shall be unlawful for any person to employ or direct others to perform labor of any kind in the erecting, demolishing, repairing, altering, cleaning, or painting of a building or other structure without first having furnished proper protection to such person so employed or directed, as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.

         The Commissioner shall attach to every scaffold, staging, mechanism, or mechanical device inspected by him or her a certificate bearing the Commissioner's name and the date of inspection, and the certificate shall plainly state whether he or she has found the scaffolding, staging, or mechanical device "safe" or "unsafe."
        </li>
        <li id="t25c15s25-15-110ol1c3">
         If the Commissioner finds any scaffolding, staging, or mechanical device complained of to be unsafe, the Commissioner shall at once notify in writing the person responsible for the erection and maintenance of the scaffolding, staging, or mechanical device that the Commissioner has found it to be unsafe. Such notice may be served personally upon the person responsible under the law or may be perfected by affixing such notice in a conspicuous place on the scaffold, staging, or mechanical device found unsafe. The manner of service shall be within the discretion of the Commissioner. The Commissioner shall then prohibit the use of such scaffolding, staging, or mechanical device by any person until all danger has been removed or until it has been made to comply with the terms of this Code section by alteration, reconstruction, demolition, or replacement, as the Commissioner may direct.
