    - Guardian cannot, with or without court order, use minor ward's funds to pay third party's debt; nor is the guardian authorized without such an order to invest the funds of the ward in bonds issued by a private corporation. Where the guardian attempts to do either, and tenders to the opposite party in the transaction, as payee, a check bearing the signature of the ward by the guardian, these facts without more are sufficient to put the payee on inquiry as to the validity of the transaction.

       - A guardian of the person is defined to be one who has been lawfully invested with the care of the person of an infant whose natural guardian is dead, and is considered as standing in the place of the natural guardian. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Natural guardianship, pure and simple, is of the person only, and is incident to the relation of parent. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The ordinary (now probate judge) is without power to appoint a guardian for the person or for the property of a child unless the child has no guardian as to the one or the other of these things for which the guardianship is asked. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There cannot be two guardianships at same time
       
       as to either person or property of infant, though one person may be guardian of infant's person and another may be guardian of infant's property. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

         Mother is natural guardian automatically.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Ordinary (now probate judge) has nothing to do with constituting mother natural guardian; the mother is natural guardian by operation of law, and without any action whatever by the ordinary (now probate judge) - no appointment, no letters of guardianship are contemplated and nothing is said of any authority of the ordinary (now probate judge) to displace the parent as guardian of the person. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - For a minor having no guardian, the ordinary (now probate judge) may appoint a guardian of person and property, or of either, but if the minor has a natural guardian, it certainly cannot be said in a broad sense that the person has no guardian; in such case the range of appointment is limited to guardianship of the property, for it is only as to property that there is no guardian. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Guardian of person and property of a lunatic is entitled to retain possession and control of ward's effects so long as guardianship continues; and to deprive the guardian of such possession and control before ward is restored to sanity, it is necessary that the guardian's letters be revoked and another guardian appointed. Bonner v. Evans, <cite class="ga_court">89 Ga. 656</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E. 906</cite> (1892) (decided under prior law).

       - Deposit of ward's funds to individual account of guardian, and failure to account therefor, is per se breach of the bond. Hawes v. Standard Accident Ins.

       - Suit for divorce instituted by guardian in behalf of one who has been adjudicated insane cannot be maintained in this state; the right to bring and prosecute such an action being strictly personal, and not within authority conferred by law upon a guardian. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 106</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 621</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       - If a next friend suing in behalf of a lunatic can maintain an action for waste committed by the guardian, or recover money in the guardian's hands, it can be done only in connection with a proceeding to remove the guardian and revoke guardianship letters.

       - Because a lawyer failed to present any evidence of the value of the lawyer's services at a probate hearing, the trial court was left to determine that value based on its own experience; since the lawyer failed to prove that the contingency agreement with the beneficiaries of an estate provided for a reasonable fee, the trial court was authorized to determine that $15,000 was a reasonable fee.

       - The probate court has no authority to appoint another as guardian of the person of a child with a living natural guardian unless the loss of that status has been ascertained and declared in some regular proceeding authorized by law, after due notice is given. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When natural mother of illegitimate child showed that she was the child's mother, that her parental rights had not been relinquished or forfeited in some regular proceeding authorized by law, and that she was, therefore, the natural guardian of the child, the probate court was without jurisdiction to appoint someone else as the guardian of the child's person. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        Mother of illegitimate child is the child's natural guardian
       
       with prima-facie right to custody. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Although the petitioner argued the appointment of guardianship was proper because the mother, the natural guardian of the minor children involved, had voluntarily waived her parental rights and consented to the award of guardianship by sworn affidavit, the affidavit clearly conferred only temporary custody, and made no reference to permanent guardianship. Parental rights are not relinquished by an agreement granting mere custody. Hill v. Loren, <cite class="ga_app_court">187 Ga.

       - Upon death of parent who has held custody under divorce decree, the right to custody automatically inures to surviving parent, and divorce proceeding fails so far as concerns any further right to custody of children.

       The probate court of the county in which a minor is found or in which the proposed permanent guardian is domiciled shall have the power to appoint a permanent guardian for a minor who has no natural guardian, testamentary guardian, or permanent guardian. In its discretion, the probate court of the county in which the petition for appointment of a permanent guardian is filed may transfer the case to the probate court of any other county in this state if such transfer would serve the best interest of the minor.

       - The first step which ward must take to remove guardian appointed by the ordinary (now judge of probate court), and substitute therefor one of the ward's own selection, after the ward has arrived at age to make such selection, is to institute a proceeding to revoke letters of guardian. The ward can only do this by petition filed in court of ordinary (now probate court) of county of guardian's appointment. Dickerson v. Bowen, <cite class="ga_court">128 Ga. 122</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E. 326</cite> (1907) (decided under former Civil Code 1895,

An inquiry into a guardianship applicant's "unobjectionability" may broadly consider the applicant's suitability, habits, responsibility, sense, and morality, as well as the financial interests of the child. A person may be "objectionable," and not entitled to guardianship as a matter of right, even though the objections would not authorize interfering with the person's right to custody of the person's own child.

       - Where both parents of an infant child are deceased, the father having survived the mother and by will having provided that his mother should be testamentary guardian of the person of such child, and where in a contest between the paternal and the maternal grandmothers of the child it appears that both are fit and proper persons to have custody of the child, the testamentary guardian is entitled to the custody.

        Child's grandmother was not entitled to the absolute preference
       
       provided for in the statute, and custody of the child was properly awarded to the child's aunt and uncle since: (1) the trial court noted that the grandmother had not exhibited good parenting skills in regard to her own children and had led an inappropriate life style in the presence of minors in the past; (2) the court noted that she divorced the children's father when they were young and then had two long term live in relationships while the minor children lived in her house; (3) one of the children went to live with her father for a year when she was 13 because of difficulties in her relationship with her mother and subsequently left home before finishing high school; and (4) the court found that the grandmother had time and again made poor moral decisions and that educational success had not been a priority for her or her children.

       - It is not necessary to issue a second citation when the first citation of application for letters of administration is for the appointment of one person even though the court issues letters of administration to an entirely different person, as to whose appointment no previous notice had been given to any one. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Gilmore, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 894</cite>, <cite class="app_court">157 S.E. 188</cite> (1931) (decided under former Civil Code 1910,

        No citation is necessary for appointment of testamentary guardian
       
       and a testamentary guardian might be authorized by probate court to take charge of property coming to the guardian's ward from sources other than parent's will, without necessity of citation.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When an applicant has already, by will, been made testamentary guardian, it is a matter of testamentary disposition, and there would seem to be no necessity for further notice. Moreover, the law raises implication that there could be no better selection for guardianship of property of minors coming from outside sources than that already provided by the father in his own will as to their persons and property devised by the will.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The object of former Code 1933,
   §
   49-604 in requiring notice to relatives was not to confer any right upon them, but was solely for the purpose of protecting public and interest of alleged incompetent. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 776</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 767</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Relations notified are not parties in their own behalf
       
       but are notified for benefit of person to be considered and given an opportunity to be heard in that person's behalf. They are not summoned by process; no judgment can be rendered against them merely because of such notice; and there is no provision for taxing costs against them. Slaughter v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established. Johnson v. Jones, <cite class="ga_app_court">214 Ga. App. 386</cite>, <cite class="app_court">448 S.E.2d 1</cite> (1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - A ward's stepchildren are not children under the guardianship statute, nor are they next of kin, and because there were individuals in this case related to the ward by blood, who were not notified of the guardianship proceedings, the appointment of the guardian was void. Wilson v. James, <cite class="ga_court">260 Ga. 234</cite>, <cite class="app_court">392 S.E.2d 5</cite> (1990) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - Probate courts of this state have jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for person of nonresident insane person if nonresident is found within limits of county of probate court's jurisdiction. Sorrells v. Sorrells, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 9</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 314</cite> (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       Probate court of Cobb County did not lack jurisdiction over proceedings involving ward who was a Stephens County resident but had been transferred to a convalescent center in Cobb County, where it was uncontroverted that no plea to the court's jurisdiction was filed and that ward was at the time of the proceeding "found" in Cobb County.

       - Superior court erred in granting an aunt and uncle custody of minor children because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petition for custody since a probate court had exclusive jurisdiction to issue and revoke letters of testamentary guardianship, and O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t29c02s29-2-4ol1b" target="_self">29-2-4(b)</a></cite> mandated the issuance of letters of testamentary guardianship to the brother of the children's father without notice and a hearing and without consideration of the children's best interests; equity afforded no valid basis for the superior court's exercise of jurisdiction because the aunt and uncle had an appropriate remedy in the probate court to challenge the testamentary guardianship: a petition for revocation or suspension of the brother's letters of testamentary guardianship.

       - Because a lawyer failed to present any evidence of the value of the lawyer's services at a probate hearing, the trial court was left to determine that value based on its own experience; since the lawyer failed to prove that the contingency agreement with the beneficiaries of an estate provided for a reasonable fee, the trial court was authorized to determine that $15,000 was a reasonable fee.

     <p>
      Before entering upon the duties of the appointment, every guardian appointed pursuant to the terms of this chapter shall take an oath or affirmation before the court to perform well and truly the duties required of a guardian and to account faithfully for the estate. The oath or affirmation of a guardian may be subscribed before the judge or clerk of any probate court of this state. The judge of the probate court who appoints the guardian shall have the authority to grant a commission to a judge or clerk of any court of record of any other state to administer the oath or affirmation.

       - Inventory and appraisement, when properly filed and recorded in the office of the court of ordinary (now probate court), is prima facie proof as to the property owned by the deceased at the time of death, and an estimate of the value thereof. If not a true inventory and appraisal, the burden is upon the removed administrator to prove that it is not correct, and account to the ordinary (now probate judge) for the items which the administrator listed and submitted to the appraisers, and which the administrator verified as correct.

   §

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t29c02s29-2-30ol1a" target="_self">29-2-30(a)</a></cite>, termination of the brother's guardianship would not occur until the earliest of the following events: the minors reached age 18, the minors were adopted, the minors were emancipated, the minors died, or a court order terminating the guardianship was entered, and none of those conditions were met.

Notice shall be published one time in the newspaper in which sheriff's advertisements are published in the county in which the petition is filed and shall state that any objection must be made in writing and shall designate the date on or before which objections must be filed in the court, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of publication.

   §

        Annual returns which do not substantially comply
       
       with the law are not prima facie proof in favor of the administrator. If they are allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge) and recorded, under the terms of the statute, anyone challenging their correctness must carry the burden of proving their incorrectness. But when the returns are not allowed by the ordinary (now probate judge), the burden is upon the administrator to prove the returns' correctness in a proceeding in the court of ordinary (now probate court) for an accounting and settlement. Ellis v. McWilliams, <cite class="ga_app_court">70 Ga. App. 195</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 886</cite> (1943) (decided under Ga. L. 1943, p. 409,

        Mere failure to attach vouchers to returns,
       
       standing alone, would not constitute a fraud upon the court of ordinary (now probate court). The total failure to file any returns at all would not, within itself, constitute fraud, nor afford a good reason for the interference of equity. While under the law it is the duty of an administrator to file annual returns accompanied by original vouchers, the duty is placed upon the ordinary (now probate court) to examine the returns to determine their correctness and interested parties are given 30 days in which to file objections to the returns. Hoffman v. Chester, <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 296</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 760</cite> (1948).

       - The probate court has no authority to appoint another as guardian of the person of a child with a living natural guardian unless the loss of that status has been ascertained and declared in some regular proceeding authorized by law, after due notice is given. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       When natural mother of illegitimate child showed that she was the child's mother, that her parental rights had not been relinquished or forfeited in some regular proceeding authorized by law, and that she was, therefore, the natural guardian of the child, the probate court was without jurisdiction to appoint someone else as the guardian of the child's person. Whitlock v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 100</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 244</cite> (1981) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Although the petitioner argued the appointment of guardianship was proper because the mother, the natural guardian of the minor children involved, had voluntarily waived her parental rights and consented to the award of guardianship by sworn affidavit, the affidavit clearly conferred only temporary custody, and made no reference to permanent guardianship. Parental rights are not relinquished by an agreement granting mere custody. Hill v. Loren, <cite class="ga_app_court">187 Ga.

       A probate court clearly has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for a minor. However, a guardian, once appointed, need not obtain the approval of the probate court to settle a contested or doubtful claim for or against the minor. Accordingly, any settlement of the tort claims of minors to which their duly appointed guardian agreed would not have to be approved by the probate court. King Cotton, Ltd. v. Powers, <cite class="ga_app_court">200 Ga. App. 549</cite>, <cite class="app_court">409 S.E.2d 67</cite> (1991) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       A guardian of property need not obtain prior approval of the probate court in order to compromise or settle a contested or disputed claim. Hay v. Norfolk S. Ry., 879 F. Supp. 1192 (N.D. Ga. 1994) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

        The probate court's jurisdiction to approve the settlement
       
       of a malpractice claim and to protect the best interests of the incapacitated ward conferred upon that court the authority to require that the ward's attorneys pay into the registry of court such settlement funds as they disbursed to themselves and to hold them in contempt for their refusal to do so.

       - The word "objectionable" in former Code 1933,
   §
   49-107 referred not to moral qualities exclusively but to any position or course of dealing which led to the conclusion that the interest of a person selected was adverse to that of the estate.

       A court has wide discretion in determining whether an applicant was entitled to the absolute preference set forth in former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t29c04s29-4-8" target="_self">29-4-8</a></cite>, and it was apparent that "objectionability" in a guardianship dispute was not the same as "parental unfitness," which must generally be shown before a court can interfere with a parent's right to custody over a child. An inquiry into a guardianship applicant's "unobjectionability" may broadly consider the applicant's suitability, habits, responsibility, sense, and morality, as well as the financial interests of the child. A person may be "objectionable," and not entitled to guardianship as a matter of right, even though the objections would not authorize interfering with the person's right to custody of the person's own child. Huval v. Jacobs, <cite class="ga_app_court">248 Ga. App. 696</cite>, <cite class="app_court">548 S.E.2d 437</cite> (2001) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

       - Where both parents of an infant child are deceased, the father having survived the mother and by will having provided that his mother should be testamentary guardian of the person of such child, and where in a contest between the paternal and the maternal grandmothers of the child it appears that both are fit and proper persons to have custody of the child, the testamentary guardian is entitled to the custody.

        Child's grandmother was not entitled to the absolute preference
       
       provided for in the statute, and custody of the child was properly awarded to the child's aunt and uncle since: (1) the trial court noted that the grandmother had not exhibited good parenting skills in regard to her own children and had led an inappropriate life style in the presence of minors in the past; (2) the court noted that she divorced the children's father when they were young and then had two long term live in relationships while the minor children lived in her house; (3) one of the children went to live with her father for a year when she was 13 because of difficulties in her relationship with her mother and subsequently left home before finishing high school; and (4) the court found that the grandmother had time and again made poor moral decisions and that educational success had not been a priority for her or her children.

       - Where applicant has already, by will, been made testamentary guardian, it is a matter of testamentary disposition, and there would seem to be no necessity for further notice. Moreover, the law raises implication that there could be no better selection for guardianship of property of minors coming from outside sources than that already provided by the father in his own will as to their persons and property devised by the will.

       - Probate court, when selecting a new guardian for appellant, erred in failing to consider appellant's next of kin; because the hearing was not recorded, and because the order failed to explain the reason the probate court selected the county guardian as the new guardian, the record supported appellant's argument that the probate court failed to consider the statutory preferences of former O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Failure of executor or guardian to make returns is an omission of duty, and therefore a breach of trust, and puts upon the executor the burden of proving to satisfaction of court that the executor discharged trust with fidelity. Wellborn v. Rogers, <cite class="ga_court">24 Ga. 558</cite> (1858) (decided under Ga. L. 1855-56, p. 147,

       - Failure of guardian to make returns of interest accumulated in guardian's hands is not by itself sufficient to authorize finding of fraud and charging of compound interest. Royston v. Royston, <cite class="ga_court">29 Ga. 82</cite> (1859) (decided under Ga. L. 1855-56, p. 147,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Probate court, when selecting a new guardian for appellant, erred in failing to consider appellant's next of kin; because the hearing was not recorded, and because the order failed to explain the reason the probate court selected the county guardian as the new guardian, the record supported appellant's argument that the probate court failed to consider the statutory preferences of former O.C.G.A.

       - Guardian of person and property of a lunatic is entitled to retain possession and control of ward's effects so long as guardianship continues; and to deprive the guardian of such possession and control before ward is restored to sanity, it is necessary that the guardian's letters be revoked and another guardian appointed.

       - If a next friend suing in behalf of a lunatic can maintain an action for waste committed by the guardian, or recover money in the guardian's hands, it can be done only in connection with a proceeding to remove the guardian and revoke guardianship letters.

       A probate court clearly has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for a minor. However, a guardian, once appointed, need not obtain the approval of the probate court to settle a contested or doubtful claim for or against the minor. Accordingly, any settlement of the tort claims of minors to which their duly appointed guardian agreed would not have to be approved by the probate court. King Cotton, Ltd. v.

       - Probate court, when selecting a new guardian for appellant, erred in failing to consider appellant's next of kin; because the hearing was not recorded, and because the order failed to explain the reason the probate court selected the county guardian as the new guardian, the record supported appellant's argument that the probate court failed to consider the statutory preferences of former O.C.G.A.

       - Although guardian may in good faith have disposed of funds by investing a portion of them in real estate for benefit of the ward, who afterwards during minority occupies the real estate as a home, there is no presumption that these expenditures are legally made by the guardian's having obtained from judge an order for investment of funds in real estate.

       - An ordinary (now judge of probate court) does not have jurisdiction to cite for settlement a guardian who was not appointed by the judge and who had never, in any way, been subject to jurisdiction of such judge and acknowledgment of service of citation was no waiver of jurisdiction where guardian did not appear or plead to the citation.

        <p>
       - While a guardian may have the right to hold funds of the ward, uninvested, for purpose of paying off a judgment as to which there is pending litigation, if the guardian mingles such funds with the guardian's own, the guardian is liable for interest thereon, even though the guardian individually has at all times with banks, enough money to settle fully with the ward, none of such money being deposited by the depositor as guardian.

        Guardian's failure to file annual returns
       
       was evidence that the guardian's fiduciary duties were breached and such evidence supported removal. Gary v. Weiner, <cite class="ga_app_court">233 Ga. App. 284</cite>, <cite class="app_court">503 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1998) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

    - Joint tenancies in bank and stock investment accounts and in real property did not terminate as a matter of law when one of the joint tenants was declared incapacitated and a guardian was appointed for that person and for the property. A guardian, unlike a trustee, has no beneficial title in the ward's estate, but is merely a custodian or manager. Moore v. Self, <cite class="ga_app_court">222 Ga.

       - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established.

       Probate court of Cobb County did not lack jurisdiction over proceedings involving ward who was a Stephens County resident but had been transferred to a convalescent center in Cobb County, where it was uncontroverted that no plea to the court's jurisdiction was filed and that ward was at the time of the proceeding "found " in Cobb County.

       - The object of former Code 1933,
   §
   49-604 in requiring notice to relatives was not to confer any right upon them, but was solely for the purpose of protecting public and interest of alleged incompetent. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 776</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 767</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Relations notified are not parties in their own behalf
       
       but are notified for benefit of person to be considered and given an opportunity to be heard in that person's behalf. They are not summoned by process; no judgment can be rendered against them merely because of such notice; and there is no provision for taxing costs against them. Slaughter v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established.

       - A ward's stepchildren are not children under the guardianship statute, nor are they next of kin, and because there were individuals in this case related to the ward by blood, who were not notified of the guardianship proceedings, the appointment of the guardian was void.

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

       Upon the petition of any interested person, including the ward, or upon the court's own motion, the court may modify the guardianship by adjusting the duties or powers of the guardian, as defined in Code Sections 29-4-22 and 29-4-23, or the powers of the ward, as defined in Code Sections 29-4-20 and 29-4-21, or by making other appropriate adjustments to reflect the extent of the current capacity of the ward or other circumstances of the guardianship. Except for good cause shown, the court shall order that notice of the petition be given, in whatever form the court deems appropriate, to the ward, the guardian, the ward's legal counsel, and the ward's conservator, if any. In any proceeding under this Code section that would expand or increase the powers of the guardian or further restrict the rights of the ward, the court shall appoint legal counsel for the ward. In all other cases, the court, in its discretion, may appoint legal counsel for the ward or a guardian ad litem, or both.

       If the petition for modification alleges a significant change in the capacity of the ward, it must be supported either by the affidavits of two persons who have knowledge of the ward, one of whom may be the petitioner, or of a physician licensed to practice medicine under Chapter 34 of Title 43, a psychologist licensed to practice under Chapter 39 of Title 43, or a licensed clinical social worker, setting forth the supporting facts and determinations. If, after reviewing the petition and the affidavits, the court determines that there is no probable cause to believe that there has been a significant change in the capacity of the ward, the court shall dismiss the petition. If the petition is not dismissed, the court shall order that an evaluation be conducted, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of Code Section 29-4-11. If, after reviewing the evaluation report, the court finds that there is no probable cause to believe that there has been a significant change in the capacity of the ward, the court shall dismiss the petition. If the petition is not dismissed, the court shall schedule a hearing, with notice as the court deems appropriate.

        Guardian's failure to file annual returns
       
       was evidence that the guardian's fiduciary duties were breached and such evidence supported removal. Gary v. Weiner, <cite class="ga_app_court">233 Ga. App. 284</cite>, <cite class="app_court">503 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1998) (decided under former O.C.G.A.

    - Joint tenancies in bank and stock investment accounts and in real property did not terminate as a matter of law when one of the joint tenants was declared incapacitated and a guardian was appointed for that person and for the property. A guardian, unlike a trustee, has no beneficial title in the ward's estate, but is merely a custodian or manager. Moore v. Self, <cite class="ga_app_court">222 Ga.

       - Seeking to avoid the recovery of Medicaid payments from their mother's estate, when the daughters opted their mother out of Medicaid and planned to sell some of the mother's property, those decisions were properly held to not be in the mother's best interest and supported the appointment of the county conservator in said capacity.

       - Given a parent's gravely-impaired judgment, which combined with a physical frailty and impaired vision, made the parent vulnerable to exploitation by a new person living with the parent, the probate court properly concluded that the parent lacked sufficient understanding to make significant responsible decisions concerning the management of the parent's property; moreover, because the parent chose not to include the transcript of the evidence in the appellate record, and, as any pre-trial ruling on the parent's capabilities was, after a trial determining the matter, harmless if not moot, the probate court's ruling was upheld.

       - Probate court, when selecting a new guardian for appellant, erred in failing to consider appellant's next of kin; because the hearing was not recorded, and because the order failed to explain the reason the probate court selected the county guardian as the new guardian, the record supported appellant's argument that the probate court failed to consider the statutory preferences of former O.C.G.A.

       - The object of former Code 1933,
   §
   49-604 in requiring notice to relatives was not to confer any right upon them, but was solely for the purpose of protecting public and interest of alleged incompetent. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 776</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 767</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Relations notified are not parties in their own behalf
       
       but are notified for benefit of person to be considered and given an opportunity to be heard in that person's behalf. They are not summoned by process; no judgment can be rendered against them merely because of such notice; and there is no provision for taxing costs against them. Slaughter v.

       - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established.

       - Even though it was shown that a petitioner for appointment as guardian failed to name an adult child of the ward, because petitioner did not know the child's address, and included another child's residence address on the petition, rather than the county jail where petitioner knew that child was incarcerated, failure to comply with statutory notice requirements was not established.

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

   §

        Guardians, acting en autre droit, are generally held personally liable
       
       on promissory notes, because they have no authority to bind ex directo the persons for whom, or for whose benefit, or for whose estate they act; and hence to give any validity to a note they must be deemed personally bound as makers.

       Each year, within 60 days of the anniversary date of qualification, every conservator shall file with the court a verified return consisting of a statement of the receipts and expenditures of the conservatorship during the year preceding the anniversary date of qualification, an updated inventory consisting of a statement of the assets and liabilities of the estate as of the anniversary date of qualification, an updated plan for managing, expending, and distributing the ward's property, a note or memorandum of any other fact necessary to show the true condition of the estate, and a statement of the current amount of the bond.

The return shall be kept on file in the court. The recorded return shall be prima-facie evidence of its correctness. If there is an objection to the return or if the court on its own motion determines that the conservator may have wasted the property of the ward or failed in any manner to comply with applicable law, the court shall hold a hearing or take such other action as the court deems appropriate.

       - An ordinary (now judge of probate court) does not have jurisdiction to cite for settlement a guardian who was not appointed by the judge and who had never, in any way, been subject to jurisdiction of such judge and acknowledgment of service of citation was no waiver of jurisdiction where guardian did not appear or plead to the citation.

       The court in its discretion may at any time appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of a minor, a proposed ward, or a ward in proceedings relating to the guardianship or conservatorship of that individual.

       Except as provided in subsection (a) of this Code section, when a person who is entitled to notice under any provision of this title is not sui juris, the interests of that person shall be represented in the proceeding by a guardian ad litem; provided, however, that the court may determine for the purpose of the particular proceeding that the natural guardian, if any, or the testamentary guardian, if any, or the duly constituted conservator, if any, or the duly constituted guardian, if any, has no conflict of interest and thus may represent for the purpose of the proceeding a person who is not sui juris. Service upon or notice to a guardian ad litem shall constitute service upon or notice to that person who is not sui juris and no additional service upon or notice to that person shall be required. Waivers, acknowledgments, consents, answers, objections, or other documents executed by a guardian ad litem shall be binding upon the person represented.
