       - McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII retaliation cases is appropriately utilized in the context of evaluating whether a state whistle-blower claim is subject to summary adjudication, and this analytical framework is in no way inconsistent with the holding that circumstantial evidence may preclude summary judgment in these cases because the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis rightly places on the plaintiff the ultimate burden of proving that he or she was the victim of discrimination; therefore, the following analytical framework is applied to claims brought pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       - Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Georgia Department of Human Services in the employees' action alleging that the employees were terminated from a county department of children and family services for reporting the unlawful conduct of a coworker in violation of the whistle-blower statute, O.C.G.A.

Forrester v. Ga. Dep't of Human Servs., <cite class="ga_app_court">308 Ga. App. 716</cite>, <cite class="app_court">708 S.E.2d 660</cite> (2011).

       In a wrongful termination case, the trial court erred by failing to grant the motion for summary judgment filed by the employer because the only evidence the employee presented of a causal connection was the temporal proximity between the disclosures and the adverse actions; but the only action that occurred less than three months after the disclosures were not materially adverse and the employee did not even allege that the person who took the action knew of the protected disclosures.

        Former police officer's retaliation claim against a city failed under summary judgment because the officer did not produce evidence of a causal connection as to one adverse employment action, another adverse action was only at most a petty, slight, or minor annoyance and, in any event, the officer had not shown pretext as to the city's proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the city's actions.

   ยง
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t45c01s45-1-4" target="_self">45-1-4</a></cite>, summary judgment was properly granted to the defendant as the plaintiffs failed to establish prima facie cases of retaliation because the plaintiffs, in making their complaints regarding short-staffing, identified only internal operating procedures for staffing requirements as the basis for their concerns; the plaintiffs did not disclose a violation or failure to comply with any law, rule, or regulation prior to their termination; and the plaintiffs did not object to or refuse to participate in an activity, policy, or practice which the plaintiffs reasonably believed to be in violation of or noncompliance with a law, rule, or regulation.

       - Decision granting summary judgment to the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia on a former administrative assistant's (AA) Georgia Whistleblower Act claim was proper as the former AA failed to establish that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the reason for the former AA's termination; the board submitted direct evidence that the former AA's termination was based on insubordinate behavior during an exchange with a college president, but the former AA failed to present any evidence contradicting the occurrence of the dispute between the former AA and the president.

      The following persons are ineligible to hold any civil office; and the existence of any of the following facts shall be a sufficient reason for vacating any office held by such person; but the acts of such person, while holding a commission, shall be valid as the acts of an officer de facto, namely:

The residency requirement for a candidate for any county office, except offices of a judicial nature, shall be 12 months' residency within the county. The residency requirement for a candidate for any municipal office, except offices of a judicial nature, shall be 12 months' residency within the municipality; provided, however, that municipalities may by charter provide for lesser residency requirements for candidates for municipal office, except offices of a judicial nature. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, the General Assembly may provide by local law for a period of district residency for candidates for any county or municipal governing authority or board of education who are elected from districts not to exceed 12 months' residency within the district from which each such candidate seeks election. Any local law previously enacted by the General Assembly providing for a period of district residency for candidates for county or municipal office which does not exceed 12 months shall be granted full force and effect;

Acceptance of such an appointment and receipt of the emoluments therefrom shall not bar the right of any person to hold office in this state or to accede to a state office;

        <p>
       - When an individual was appointed to the position of recorder's court judge pro tem, and at all times subsequent to appointment held self out to the public as a recorder's judge pro tem and performed the duties of that office, including accepting guilty pleas, issuing search warrants, and holding preliminary hearings, that individual was a de facto officer and as such that individual's acts could not be collaterally attacked and set aside; thus, a search warrant issued by this individual was not null and void, and there was nothing in the record to indicate that the recorder court judge pro tem did not act in a neutral and detached manner in issuing the warrant. Freeman v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">172 Ga. App. 168</cite>, <cite class="app_court">322 S.E.2d 289</cite> (1984).
       </p>

        <p>
       Arrest warrant was not subsequently invalid because it was signed by a magistrate who was later removed from office for misconduct and, thus, any subsequent proceedings thereafter were also not invalid, as: (1) the magistrate's acts while in officer were considered valid as the acts of an officer de facto; and (2) due to such, the magistrate's acts could not be collaterally attacked and set aside. Keith v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">279 Ga. App. 819</cite>, <cite class="app_court">632 S.E.2d 669</cite> (2006).

         "County officers" defined.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - In a technical sense, the term "county officers" includes only the "county officers" referred to in 1945, Art. XI, Sec. II, Para. 1 (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. I, Para. III), i.e., those who are elected by the qualified voters of their respective counties and hold office for four years. 1958-59 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 146.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, unless there is some special statute, a county police officer does not come within the term of one holding a county office. The county office within the purview of this section has been held to be an office created by law for a term of four years and elected by the people of the county. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 20.

         No disqualification from running for another office.

       <p>
        - This section does not say that a person holding one office shall be disqualified to be elected to another, but merely says that a person may not hold two such offices at the same time; the effect of this language is that a person holding one office is not disqualified from running for another, but on election to the latter office, that person automatically forfeits the first. 1958-59 Op.

        - Although this section declares that no person shall hold two county offices, it appears that qualifying as a candidate for the office of ordinary (now judge of probate court) while serving as a justice of the peace, would not result in placing the candidate in the position of holding two county offices; moreover, a justice of the peace is not a county but a state officer. 1968 Op.

        - A member of the county board of education would be eligible to run in a county primary for the office of county commissioner, since a primary is not an election in the strict sense of the term, and obviously does not result in placing the successful nominee in the position of "holding" an office within the meaning of this section; however, if the person receives the nomination, that person must resign as a member of the school board prior to qualifying in general a election for commissioner. 1958-59 Op.

       - Previous state constitutions explicitly provided that the term of office for superior court judges "shall be for four years, and until his successor is qualified." Omission of the phrase "until his successor is qualified" in the 1983 Constitution does not prevent judges from remaining in office after their four-year term of office ends. Garcia v.

       - After a local Act was enacted to abolish the board of county commissioners and establish a new board, but the Act failed to provide for an election date for the new members, the members of the board existing at the date of its passage should discharge the duties and functions of their office until the members of the new board are elected and qualified.

       - The effect of this section is to extend the term of office under the original appointment until a successor has been qualified, with the further effect that liability on an official bond continues when an official elected for a fixed period thereafter holds over, after its expiration, until a successor is appointed.

       While the general rule is that sureties are liable only for a breach of official duty committed by their principal during the term of office for which the bond was given, the effect of this section is to extend the term of office under the original appointment until a successor has been qualified, with the further effect that liability on such a bond continues when an official elected for a fixed period thereafter holds over, after its expiration, until a successor is appointed.

       - Removal of the appellant from a city zoning board was upheld because once the appellant held over, the appellant could be replaced at any time, without regard to cause, by the city council appointing a successor and since the member did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the position once becoming a holdover official, the appellant was not entitled to due process protections before the city council appointed the successor.

      All bonds that this chapter applies to shall have at least two and not more than 20 good and solvent sureties who shall be worth the amount of said bond, over and above their homestead, in case of county officers, all of whom must be permanent residents of the state and two of whom must also be residents of the county; provided, however, that a surety insurance company which has complied with all requirements to transact business in this state may be accepted as surety upon the bond of any person required by law to execute bonds, in lieu of any other surety or sureties, as provided in Code Section 45-4-6. When the approving court or officers do not know that a surety is worth the required amount, they shall not accept him unless he swears that his means are sufficient in amount, which swearing they shall record on the bond.

       - When an election for Commissioner of Madison County, a legislative office, was held in November, at which an incumbent was reelected to such office, it was the incumbent's duty to file an official bond with the ordinary (now probate judge) on or before January 1; and, upon the incumbent's own personal failure to do so, a vacancy in the office resulted.

        <p>
       - When, after November election, ordinary (now probate judge) received from Governor a commission and oath, and on December 18 notified the officer so reelected that the ordinary had them ready for the officer elect to qualify by filing an official bond and taking the oath, and the officer, having already on December 6 applied to a surety company to become a surety, but not having heard from the company, failed to do anything more until after the first day of January toward procurement of a bond than to inquire of the local agent; thus, allowing the prescribed time to expire without filing the bond, the failure to file bond was necessarily the fault of the officer elect, and resulted in a vacancy of the office.

       - When a tax-collector, having no authority of law whatever to make levies and sales under tax fi. fa., issued a fi. fa. purporting to be for taxes due, and placed it in the hands of another as the tax collector's deputy, who, "armed" with the fi. fa. and acting under the instructions of the tax-collector, seized property of the alleged taxpayer and sold it, to the owner's damage, it was held that such acts constituted no breach of the tax-collector's bond and the surety on the bond was not liable therefor.

       - One who is aggrieved by the official misconduct of a deputy sheriff may at their option sue either on the sheriff's bond or on the deputy's bond. Aldridge v. Wooten, <cite class="ga_app_court">68 Ga. App. 887</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 700</cite> (1943).

        <p>
       A plaintiff, alleging injury and damage by the wrongful acts of a sheriff and the sheriff's deputy under color of their offices, must elect to proceed either upon the sheriff's bond or upon the deputy's, and a plaintiff could not sue on the bonds of both officers in the same suit. Shelton v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">86 Ga. App. 818</cite>, <cite class="app_court">72 S.E.2d 813</cite> (1952).

       <p>
        <p>
       The bond of a public officer is a contract of suretyship. Such a contract is to be strictly construed in the interest of the surety. It follows, therefore, that the plaintiff cannot proceed against both contracts of suretyship, the one executed with the sheriff and the one executed with the deputy, but such plaintiff must elect upon which contract to proceed. Goforth v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">80 Ga. App. 121</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 656</cite> (1949).

        <p>
       - The public officer would be personally be liable in tort for any official misconduct or acts colore officii whereby the plaintiff was damaged and the plaintiff would not be restricted in a recovery to the amount of the officer's official bond.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since this section provides for the awarding of expenses of the suit, including the costs of court, it is construed to mean the present damage suit under consideration, and not the previous litigation; therefore, the plaintiff could not lawfully recover for two items of costs in previous litigation. Talmadge v. McDonald, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 728</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E. 856</cite> (1932).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The words "misconduct of the officer" as used in this section mean not only the misconduct of the sheriff, but also the misconduct of the sheriff's deputies who are the general agents of the sheriff to do and perform all acts which by law appertain to the office, and since the doctrine of respondeat superior applies, the liabilities of the sureties on the sheriff's bond are measured by that of the principal. American Sur. Co. v. Smallon, <cite class="ga_app_court">54 Ga. App. 45</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 892</cite> (1936).

       - The liability of sureties on official bonds does not ordinarily include liability for mere penalties imposed upon the principals for a dereliction of official duties, but is limited to injury sustained.

       - The measure of damages for the breach of the official bond of a sheriff is ordinarily the amount of injury actually sustained, including the reasonable expenses of the suit thereon and the costs of court.

       - Since it was not shown by the evidence that the county suffered any injury or loss because of having to pay attorney's fees, the county was not entitled to recover attorney's fees under

       - Any arbitrary omission by the officer to do that which is required of the officer by law, or any conscious disregard of the limitation upon the officer's authority, would amount to bad faith within the meaning of that term as employed in this section.

       - It is not prejudicial to the defendant for the court to charge the jury that to authorize a recovery for punitive or exemplary damages the jury must be satisfied that there was some wilful misconduct on the part of the officers, or that entire want of care by them which would give rise to the presumption of a conscious indifference to consequence, and that there must be evidence satisfactory to the jury either of malicious wantonness or of an oppression by the officers as against the plaintiff.

       - A recital that a named officer on different occasions "has stated to me, as Governor of Georgia, that if I desired to accept his resignation I could do so, and that he would 'go home,' " does not show a resignation, but merely discloses past offers to resign if the Governor then so desired. The statements so ascribed to the officer were not continuing offers, conditional or otherwise, and did not authorize future action thereon by the Governor. Patten v.

        This section is mandatory and must be given effect, notwithstanding

       - When the Governor wishes to remove an incumbent constitutional officer for reason of abandonment, notice and hearing are required for due process. Partain v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">227 Ga. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 450</cite> (1971).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Under this section, a mere charge of misconduct in office on the part of the incumbent does not show abandonment; nor may the Governor, against the will of the incumbent, declare a vacancy upon any theory of abandonment until the fact is ascertained in a judicial proceeding. Patten v. Miller, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 123</cite>, <cite class="app_court">8 S.E.2d 757</cite> (1940); Partain v.

         Abandonment caused by acquiescence in wrongful removal.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While acquiescence may be entirely different from abandonment, the abandonment of a public office may result from an acquiescence by the officer in wrongful removal or discharge; after a summary removal, an unreasonable delay by an officer illegally removed in taking steps to vindicate rights may constitute an abandonment of the office, and the voluntary surrender of an office to another because of the erroneous belief that such other has been duly elected as successor to the surrendering officer may constitute an abandonment.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court's denial of the challenger's petition for a writ of quo warranto was affirmed because the newly created positions on the Georgia Court of Appeals qualified as vacancies under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. VII, Para. III; thus, the governor had the authority to appoint judges to the vacancies created by amended O.C.G.A.

Except as provided in this subsection, the commission shall be composed of the Attorney General and two public officials who hold the same office as the individual indicted. The members of the commission shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in connection with the investigation. The funds necessary to conduct the investigation shall come from funds appropriated to the executive branch of government.

While a public official is suspended under this Code section and until initial conviction by the trial court, the public official shall continue to receive the compensation from his office.

        <p>
       - A municipality cannot be held liable upon an implied contract for the value of any benefits received by it under a contract made with one of its officials when the municipality is expressly forbidden to make such a contract; such a contract, being void, cannot be ratified by an acceptance or use by the municipality of the benefits furnished thereunder.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The title acquired by a city at a tax sale is the same as that any individual would have obtained; that is, it obtains title subject to the lien of the special assessment. It is authorized to convey no better title than it holds. It may not by merely reselling the property divest the lien of the assessment; for to allow this would provide a method for vitiating the provision making this lien "coequal" with the lien of other taxes.

       - Trial court erred in denying a property owner's motion for summary judgment in a county breach of contract action because a settlement agreement between the parties was enforceable; the county attorney had authority to make the settlement offer on behalf of the county board, and while a vote in a public meeting was a required formality to effectuate the purchase, the board's failure to complete that formality when voting in the public meeting could not destroy an already existing settlement agreement.

       - Appellate court erred by holding that an environmental engineering company could recover against a city on the company's quantum meruit claim because quantum meruit was not an available remedy against the city since the claim was based on a municipal contract that was ultra vires as the contract was never approved by city council.

   (B) Each member of the General Assembly shall also receive the allowances provided by law. The amount of the daily expense allowance which each member is entitled to receive under the provisions of Code Section 28-1-8 shall be as provided in that Code section. The mileage allowance for the use of a personal car on official business shall be the same as that received by other state officials and employees.
   (C) In addition to any other compensation and allowances authorized for members of the General Assembly, each member may be reimbursed for per diem differential and for actual expenses incurred in the performance of duties as a member of the General Assembly in an amount not to exceed $7,000.00 per year. Expenses reimbursable up to such amount shall be limited to one or more of the following purposes: lodging, meals, per diem differential, postage, personal services, printing and publications, rents, supplies (including software), telecommunications, transportation, utilities, purchasing or leasing of equipment, and other reasonable expenditures directly related to the performance of a member's duties. If equipment purchased by a member has a depreciated value of $100.00 or less when such member leaves office, the equipment does not need to be returned to the state. No reimbursement shall be made for any postage which is used for a political newsletter. No reimbursement shall be paid for lodging or meals for any day for which a member receives the daily expense allowance as provided in this paragraph. Eligible expenses shall be reimbursed following the submission of vouchers to the legislative fiscal office in compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph and subject to the provisions of subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. Such vouchers shall be submitted in such form and manner as prescribed by the Legislative Services Committee pursuant to subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, provided that each such voucher shall be accompanied by a supporting document or documents, or legible copies thereof, showing payment for each expense claimed or an explanation of the absence of such documentation; in addition, each such voucher shall include a certification by the member that the information contained in such voucher and supporting document or documents, or legible copies thereof, is true and correct and that such expenses were incurred by the member. The provisions of Code Section 16-10-20 shall be applicable to any person submitting such certified vouchers and supporting documents or copies the same as if the General Assembly were a department or agency of state government. No such voucher or supporting document shall be required for per diem differential.
   (D) The amount of per diem differential which may be claimed for each day under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph shall be the difference between the daily expense allowance authorized for members of the General Assembly and $119.00; provided, however, that the General Appropriations Act for any fiscal year may increase such amount of $119.00 per day to an amount not in excess of the federal per diem rate then in effect for the state capital as specified by the General Services Administration. Per diem differential shall be paid by the legislative fiscal office to the member upon the member's notification to the legislative fiscal office of the days for which the daily expense allowance was received for which the member wishes to claim the per diem differential, and the legislative fiscal office shall keep a record of the days for which per diem differential is so claimed and paid.
   (E) For the purposes of this paragraph, a year shall begin on the convening date of the General Assembly in regular session each year and end on the day prior to the convening of the General Assembly in the next calendar year. Any voucher or claim for any reimbursement for any year as defined in this paragraph shall be submitted no later than the fifteenth of April immediately following the end of such year. No reimbursement shall be made on any voucher or claim submitted after that date. Any amounts remaining in such expense account at the end of the first year of the two-year biennium may be claimed for expenses incurred during the second year of the two-year biennium. Any amounts remaining in any expense account which are not so claimed by April 15 of the year following the second year of the biennium and any amounts claimed which are returned as hereafter provided for in this paragraph shall lapse and shall be remitted by the legislative fiscal office to the general fund of the state treasury. Any former member of the General Assembly may be reimbursed for expenses incurred while a member of the General Assembly upon compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. The Legislative Services Committee is empowered to provide such procedures as it deems advisable to administer the provisions of this paragraph, including, but not limited to, definitions of the above list of items for which reimbursement may be made; provided, however, that the term "other reasonable expenditures directly related to the performance of a member's duties" shall be as defined by policies adopted by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and by the Senate Administrative Affairs Committee as to reimbursement of such expenditures incurred by members of the House and Senate, respectively; and provided, further, that the amount of expenses which may be reimbursed within the limits of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph for travel outside the state may be as provided by policies adopted by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and by the Senate Administrative Affairs Committee as to such expenditures of members of the House and Senate, respectively. The Legislative Services Committee is further empowered to prescribe the form of the voucher or claim which must be submitted to the legislative fiscal office. In the event of any disagreement as to whether any reimbursement shall be made or any allowance shall be paid, the Legislative Services Committee shall make the final determination; except that in the event of any disagreement as to whether any reimbursement under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph shall be made for other reasonable expenses directly related to the performance of a member's duties or for travel outside the state, the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall make the final determination as to such expenses incurred by a member of the House, and the Senate Administrative Affairs Committee shall make the final determination as to such expenses incurred by a member of the Senate. In the event any reimbursement is made or any allowance is paid and it is later determined that such reimbursement or payment was made in error, the person to whom such reimbursement or payment was made shall remit to the legislative fiscal office the amount of money involved. In the event any such person refuses to make such remittance, the legislative fiscal office is authorized to withhold the payment of any other moneys to which such person is entitled until the amount of such reimbursement or payment which was made in error shall be realized.

After such date, the Speaker shall also receive as additional salary a sum equal to the amount of salary over $30,000.00 per annum which is received by the Lieutenant Governor as of that date or thereafter; and the salary of the Speaker shall be adjusted at the beginning of each term so as to include such additional sum.

      As an adjustment except as qualified below as to members and member-officers of the General Assembly, the annual salary of each state official whose salary is established by Code Section 45-7-3, this Code section, and Code Sections 45-7-20 and 45-7-21, including members of the General Assembly, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House of Representatives, may be increased by the General Assembly in the General Appropriations Act by a percentage not to exceed the average percentage of the increase in salary as may from time to time be granted to employees of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government. However, any increase for such officials shall not include within-grade step increases for which employees subject to compensation plans authorized and approved in accordance with Code Section 45-20-4 are eligible. Any increase granted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective at the same time that funds are made available for the increase for such employees, except increases for members and member-officers of the General Assembly. That portion of the increase determined by the Legislative Services Committee to reflect a cost-of-living increase based upon objective economic criteria shall become effective for members and member-officers at the same time that funds are made available for the increase for such employees. The balance of the increase for members and member-officers of the General Assembly shall become effective on the convening of the next General Assembly in January of the next odd-numbered year.

      It is in the best interests of a free society that citizens be fully informed as to the conduct of their government and that those who serve the public by performing services requiring special qualification, training, or knowledge and the exercise of discretion or judgment be known and identified. To ensure that the public may better evaluate the stewardship of elected and appointed officials in the use of public funds for the purchase of professional services from other than full-time employees, it is appropriate that disclosure be made of the use of professional personnel and of the fees and reimbursement paid for such services and incidental expenses.

Except as otherwise provided in this Code section, the proper authority to fix the amount of bonds and to approve the same is the officer or officers upon whom those duties are imposed by existing laws.

     <p>
      Upon breaches of the bond of any officer, bank, or depository, interest shall run against the principal on the bond at the rate of 7 percent per annum from the date of the breach and against the surety at the same rate from the date of the demand on the surety. If the breach shall involve dishonesty on the part of the officer or bank, the official or county authority having jurisdiction to cite the officer, or any court acquiring jurisdiction over the subject matter, may, as against the offending principal in the bond, impose an additional penalty of not more than 10 percent of the amount of the loss and a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees. This penalty and award of attorneys' fees may also be imposed upon the surety by any court acquiring jurisdiction of the subject matter, in the event it is shown that the surety has acted in bad faith and has been vexatiously litigious or that it has filed defensive proceedings for delay only. Existing laws imposing higher rates of interest or penalties upon principals or sureties upon any of such bonds are superseded by this Code section.

       This section requires a demand on the surety to initiate the running of interest against it
      
      but does not prescribe a specific form of demand. In the absence of specific statutory or contractual requirement it is only necessary to constitute a demand that the surety be notified that immediate payment of the debt is requested. There is no requirement here of demand on the principal to initiate the running of interest against the principal, and the evident purpose of the statutory requirement of demand on the surety is to give such surety an opportunity to immediately reimburse the county for any loss within the terms of the bond occasioned by the breach of principal, without subjecting it to the payment of interest prior to the time the county notifies it that immediate payment of such obligation is requested.

      In any proceeding for accounting under this chapter, there may be joined originally or by amendment, either before or after appeal, all such officers, depositories, banks, and securities on bonds of any of them as shall be necessary or proper for the full determination of any matter in controversy, and especially, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for determining the respective liabilities as between an officer and some other officer, between an officer and a bank or depository, between them or any of them and the sureties of any of them, or between sureties of any of them. The proper authority or any court which shall have acquired jurisdiction in any proceeding for accounting by appeal or otherwise shall have the jurisdiction to determine completely the respective liabilities of the parties as among themselves, as well as the liability of any officer, bank, or depository and the sureties, to the public body or bodies involved. The jurisdiction given in this chapter shall extend not only to the compelling of an officer and his sureties to account for taxes or other public money which he has in fact collected, but for money which it was his duty to collect and which, in the exercise of good faith and ordinary diligence, he should have collected; and such jurisdiction may be exercised against any public officer who has received or collected the money of any public body, whether or not it was a part of his official duty to receive it or collect it.

Such execution shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts therein recited, including the amount of loss sustained, and shall be enforceable as an execution for said amount; provided, however, that the enforcement of such execution may be arrested by proceedings in equity, or, after levy, by affidavit of illegality in which the defendant in fi. fa. whose property has been levied on shall deny liability for the amount set out in such execution or some part thereof. The affidavit of illegality shall be returned by the levying officer to the superior court of the county in which the alleged defaulting officer resides. On the trial of the case, whether in equity or on affidavit of illegality, the burden of proof shall be on the official or authority issuing the execution. Any other person, corporation, or public body at interest may on his or its own motion or on motion of either party to the cause be made a party thereto and be bound by the final judgment. Such an execution shall become final process against any defendant in execution named therein who shall endorse thereon in writing his admission of the correctness of the same and an agreement that the same shall proceed against him as final process, but such admission shall not be binding on anyone except the person or corporation signing the same.

Such official or county or municipal authority shall then cause a citation to issue and be served on the officer and the sureties on his bonds for both terms, except such of them as shall be party to or join in the petition; and such further proceedings shall be had as are provided for in Code Section 45-8-20 in cases of citation for accounting. In the order or judgment rendered by the official or county or municipal authority conducting the accounting, or, in case of appeal, in the judgment of the court, the condition of the accounts of such officers shall be stated as between the two terms and as between the sureties for the respective terms; and the order or judgment shall set the terms upon compliance with which the sureties on the bond for the expired or expiring term shall be discharged or liability as to taxes, revenues, and public moneys satisfied; and it shall also settle and determine between the sureties in the respective bonds the matters for which each is or may be liable.

       When the commissioner of administrative services determines that an adequate number of agencies, boards, bureaus, commissions, departments, or authorities of this state have requested the commissioner to do so, the commissioner shall have the authority to purchase policies of liability insurance, reinsurance, or contracts of indemnity insuring or indemnifying the officers, officials, or employees of such agencies, boards, bureaus, commissions, departments, or authorities against personal liability for damages arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, under a master policy or on a blanket coverage basis with or without deductibles or excess coverage. The commissioner may provide for endorsements for contractual liability and, where necessary or convenient to the public functions of the state, the commissioner may also provide for additional insureds. In such event, the commissioner may alternatively retain all moneys paid to the Department of Administrative Services as premiums on such policies of liability insurance or contracts of indemnity, all moneys received as interest, and all moneys received from other sources to set up and maintain a reserve fund for the payment of such liability under, and the expenses necessary to administer properly, a self-insurance program. If the commissioner decides to institute a self-insurance program, the commissioner shall establish and maintain a reserve fund for the payment of liabilities arising out of claims against officers, officials, and employees of the state and for any additional insureds. The commissioner shall also charge to state entities such premiums, deductibles, and other payments taking into account any direct appropriations as shall be necessary to maintain the soundness of the insurance or self-insurance programs established under this Code section. The commissioner is further authorized to establish incentive programs, including differential premium rates based on participation in loss control programs established by the department, increased or decreased deductibles based on participation in loss control programs established by the department, and the imposition of fines and penalties. If any premiums, deductibles, fines, or penalties are unpaid, the department is authorized to deduct any unpaid amounts from the nonpaying agency's or authority's continuation budget subject to the approval of the Office of Planning and Budget and deposit those funds into the liability trust fund provided for in this Code section. Any amounts held by the commissioner which are available for investment shall be paid over to the Office of the State Treasurer. The state treasurer shall deposit such funds in a trust account for credit only to the self-insurance program. The state treasurer shall invest these funds subject to the limitations of Code Section 50-5A-7 and Chapter 17 of Title 50. All income derived from such investments shall accrue to the self-insurance program. When moneys are paid over to the Office of the State Treasurer, as provided in this subsection, the commissioner shall submit an estimate of the date such funds shall no longer be available for investment. When the commissioner wishes to withdraw funds from the trust account provided for in this Code section, he or she shall submit a request for such withdrawal, in writing, to the state treasurer.

However, the commissioner shall incur no obligation beyond the funds then available for commitment to the obligation.

       - The phrase "in their discretion" indicates a legislative intent to give counties considerable latitude in determining what actions will be defended.

       <p>
        <p>
       When a local ordinance provided defense and indemnification to county employees who were the subject of lawsuits, but such coverage could be terminated by the county attorney, there was no abuse of discretion found by the county attorney's termination of an employee's coverage since the employee gave inaccurate or false responses to interrogatories and deposition questions regarding a prior position that the employee held; pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       - A county governing authority has the implicit power to employ counsel for county officers. Stephenson v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="ga_court">261 Ga. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">405 S.E.2d 488</cite> (1991).

       County governing authority's employment of counsel to represent a superior court clerk did not violate Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. II, Paras. I(c)(1) or (7), which preclude the authority from exercising any power in a manner affecting "any elective county office" or "any court or the personnel thereof." Stephenson v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When an official, acting in official capacity, is required to hire outside counsel to assert a legal position the local government attorney cannot (because of a conflict in representing the local government) or will not assert, and the official is successful in asserting his or her position, the local government must pay the official's attorney fees. Haralson County v. Kimball, <cite class="ga_app_court">243 Ga. App. 559</cite>, <cite class="app_court">533 S.E.2d 762</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Statutory law authorized local governments and other "public bodies" to adopt employment policies whereby the local government agreed to provide representation to the local government's employees if a conflict of interest existed and the matter did not involve property or money in which the governmental unit had an interest; since the sheriff was a local governmental unit employee who the trial court properly certified had a conflict of interest over the county commission's adoption of a budget that harmed the sheriff's department and that matter did not involve the government's property or money, the trial court properly ruled that the sheriff had a right to have counsel appointed for the sheriff, and have the sheriff's attorney's fees and expenses paid, on the sheriff's challenge to that budget.

       </span>
       Any person in government service should:
      </h5>
      <p>
       I. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or government department.
      </p>
      <p>
       II. Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       III. Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay and give to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       IV. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       V. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not, and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       VI. Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       VII. Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       VIII. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       IX. Expose corruption wherever discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       X. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - A city commissioner's removal from office, based on acts committed prior to taking office, was erroneous because: (1) removal was not authorized by the city's charter; (2) the commissioner's conduct of maintaining innocence until the entry of a guilty plea after taking office was not an official act or one done under the color of the office; (3) the acts committed did not prevent the commissioner from performing the duties of that post; and (4) the commissioner was not guilty of evading the law after becoming a member of the commission.

       - Ga. Const. 1976, Art. III, Sec. VII, Para. IV (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec. V, Para. III), was designed for the prevention of surreptitious legislation, and the prevention of "omnibus" bills containing many adverse matters; although it is not required that the title of an act contain an exact synopsis of the law itself, it is required that the matter following the enacting clause be definitely related to what is expressed in the title, and have a natural connection to the main object of the legislation; therefore, the courts could rule the Act comprised of O.C.G.A.

       It is essential to the proper operation of democratic government that public officials be independent and impartial, that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure, that public office not be used for private gain other than the remuneration provided by law, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of government. The attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists a conflict between the private interests of an elected official or a government employee and his duties as such. The public interest, therefore, requires that the law protect against such conflicts of interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of elected officials and government employees in situations where conflicts exist.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c10s45-10-21ol1b">
       It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the government of those men and women who are best qualified to serve it. An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided.

       The General Assembly declares that the operation of responsible democratic government requires that the fullest opportunity be afforded to the people to petition their government for the redress of grievances and to express freely to individual members of the General Assembly, to committees of the General Assembly, and to officials of the executive branch their opinions on legislation, on pending executive actions, and on current issues and that, to preserve and maintain the integrity of the legislative and administrative processes, it is necessary that the identity, expenditures, and activities of certain persons who engage in efforts to persuade members of the General Assembly or the executive branch to take specific actions, either by direct communication to such officials, or by solicitation of others to engage in such efforts, be publicly and regularly disclosed. The provisions of this article shall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure of such information so as to assure that the public interest will be fully protected.

       - This section is not unconstitutional for the reason that the expression "malpractice in office" is too vague and indefinite to apprise the defendant of the conduct proscribed by that section because the expression is made sufficiently definite by construing the section in connection with the laws defining the official's duties. Steele v. State, <cite class="ga_court">227 Ga. 653</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 475</cite> (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The question as to whether malpractice has been committed can only be answered by considering the laws defining the particular official's duties along with the malpractice statute; only by reading those provisions into this section is it made sufficiently definite to satisfy the requirements of a valid penal statute. Cargile v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">67 Ga. App. 610</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1942); Phillips v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga.

       - Conspiracy to commit murder is in no way similar to any crime for which a public officer would be entitled to appear before a grand jury; and thus this section does not violate the equal protection rights of a defendant so charged, under either the federal or the state Constitution.

       Word "malpractice" generally means
      
      evil, bad, or wrong practice, and when applied as in this section, to public officers and restricted to official acts by the words "in office," it retains its meaning of bad or evil, and is applied to official acts. Cargile v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">67 Ga. App. 610</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1942); Clinkscales v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga.

      Malpractice in office relating to county commissioners, as used in this section, means a wrongful or unjust doing of an act which the doer has no right to do, or failure to do what the law makes it the commissioner's duty to do, with evil intent or motive or due to culpable neglect. Cargile v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">67 Ga. App. 610</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1942); Phillips v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga.

       This section provides for official not individual misbehavior,

      <p>
       This section is available only when the public official is charged with malfeasance, or malpractice, in office, and the courts hold that such an offense is committed only when there is a close connection between the wrongful acts and the defendant's performance of official duties. Sweeney v. Balkcom, 358 F.2d 415 (5th Cir. 1966).

       Indictment charging county commissioner with malpractice in office for allowing county trucks to be used for private business was properly dismissed, since the statutes outlining the commissioner's duties did not forbid the use of public property for private purposes and the commissioner therefore was not clearly informed that the actions were criminal.

       Offense of extortion consists of
      
      the oppressive misuse of official power by the exaction of money. When an officer thought there was a right to accept a cash bond, the officer was not guilty of extortion because intent to commit the crime is necessary. Holt v.

       - The issuance of a commission is an act belonging exclusively to the Governor and cannot be inquired into by any subsequent court proceedings.

       When election to a county office is evidenced by the returns alone, a commission issued by the Governor is made final by this section, since no hearing has been sought before the Governor prior to the commission being issued. This is so whether the returns sent up are complete or incomplete. Ginn v. Linn, <cite class="ga_court">83 Ga. 180</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E. 784</cite> (1889).

       - A warrant drawn by the Governor upon the State Treasurer (now director of the Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services) directing the latter to place the amount of such warrant "to the account of the school fund," is payable out of that fund as derived from the sources authorized by the constitution and the law; and it is not only the right but the duty of the State Treasurer (now director of the Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services) to so construe such a warrant.

        <p>
       - An executive warrant upon the treasury of the state, authorizing the payment of money in pursuance of an appropriation made by law, is not a contract nor in the nature of a contract, but is only a license or power, and is revocable so long as the payment which it warranted has not been made.

       <p>
        <p>
       If revocation cannot take place by the separate act of the Governor, it can take place by the joint act of the Governor and the General Assembly; and a resolution passed by both houses and approved by the Governor, instructing the State Treasurer (now director of the Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services) not to pay a warrant, is a virtual revocation.

     <p>
      Whenever the Governor receives information, deemed by him to be reliable, that the Commissioner of Insurance, by reason of sickness or other providential cause, is unable to perform the duties of his office, the Governor shall call a council to be composed of himself, the Secretary of State, and an appointee of the Governor who is not the Attorney General; and, if such council, or a majority thereof, after investigation and examination into the truth of such report, shall, in writing duly signed, find that such officer is incapable of performing the duties of his office, the Governor, in case of incapacity of the Commissioner of Insurance, shall designate the chief clerk or other clerk then serving in the office of the Commissioner of Insurance to perform the duties of the Commissioner of Insurance during his incapacity. The person so designated to perform the duties of the Commissioner of Insurance shall give bond with good security in the penal sum of $5,000.00, payable, conditioned, and to be approved in the same manner as the bond required by law to be given by the Commissioner of Insurance. The person designated to perform the duties of the Commissioner of Insurance shall not receive any compensation in addition to that he was, or is, receiving as clerk, but any expense incurred in furnishing the bond required by this Code section and Code Section 45-12-24 shall be borne by the state. When the person designated under authority of this Code section and Code Section 45-12-24 shall have given the bond required and said bond has been approved as required, he shall be authorized to do everything, perform every act, and exercise every prerogative or discretion that the Commissioner of Insurance might do, perform, or exercise under existing law in the absence of his incapacity.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t45c12s45-12-27" target="_self">45-12-27</a></cite>, the duty of the Governor in the last resort is to enforce the process of the courts. The Governor is the executive of the process of the courts, as well as for the enforcement of all law generally. The idea of making the Governor a party defendant without consent is inconsistent with this duty. Mayo v. Renfroe, <cite class="ga_court">66 Ga. 408</cite> (1881).

     <p>
      It is the purpose of this article to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a Governor and the inauguration of a new Governor. The interest of the state requires that such transitions in the office of Governor be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the conduct of the affairs of the state government. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the state and its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in this article directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the General Assembly that all officers of the state government conduct the affairs of the state government for which they exercise responsibility and authority so as to:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t45c12s45-12-191ol11">
       Be mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of Governor;
      </li>
      <li id="t45c12s45-12-191ol12">
       Take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power; and
      </li>
      <li id="t45c12s45-12-191ol13">
       Otherwise promote orderly transitions in the office of Governor.

The Attorney General is authorized to determine the title and to change the title of any attorney or other employee of the Department of Law or any attorney at law under independent contract to the Department of Law in order to define the duties and responsibilities of any attorney or other employee of the said department and to establish salaries and effect promotions of any such attorney or other employee of the said department, except that those positions in the department which are within the classified service on April 18, 1975, shall be covered by the procedures prescribed by the State Personnel Board. Neither the Attorney General nor any other attorney at law employed full time by the Department of Law shall engage in the private practice of law during his or her term of appointment. Attorneys at law under independent contract to the Department of Law may engage in the private practice of law even though they may have been appointed or designated either specially or generally as assistant attorneys general or attorneys. Notwithstanding that any attorney at law under independent contract to the Department of Law has been appointed or designated either specially or generally as an assistant attorney general and thus is identified with the State of Georgia as its representative for cases arising within the scope of that appointment or designation, representation of a defendant in criminal proceedings by that assistant attorney general shall not constitute a conflict of interest if that assistant attorney general provides written disclosure of such appointment or designation to the defendant prior to accepting employment by that defendant or, when a court has appointed an assistant attorney general to represent an indigent criminal defendant, disclosures to the defendant and to the court, to be reflected in the record of that court, such appointment or designation as assistant attorney general.

   ยง
   11 of the Act) for the repeal of House Bill 255, which passed during the 1985 session and contained provisions affecting various Code sections in this chapter. House Bill 255 was also vetoed by the Governor on April 4, 1985 (Veto # 1).

     By resolution (Ga. L. 1982, p. 1345), the General Assembly designated the "Georgia Coroners Manual" as the official operating manual for coroners in the State of Georgia, authorized and directed all coroners in the state to follow the instructions, procedures, and techniques detailed in the manual, and instructed the Secretary of the Senate to forward a copy of the resolution to each coroner in the state.

    <p>
     - It is the duty of the funeral director who first assumes custody of the dead body to obtain medical certification of the cause of death; that medical certification should be completed and signed within 48 hours after death by the physician or osteopath in charge of the patient's care for the illness or condition which resulted in death except when inquiry is required by the former provisions of the Post-mortem Examination Act. 1968 Op.

      <li id="t45c16s45-16-22ol1b">
       The county governing authority shall after consulting with the coroner, if any, be authorized to appoint one or more local medical examiners who shall be licensed physicians or pathologists. The chief medical examiner may, at the request of a county governing authority, authorize one or more licensed physicians or pathologists at convenient locations throughout the state to act as local medical examiners in performing medical examiners' inquiries as required by this article. The chief medical examiner shall confer with local county officials in making appointments of regional and local medical examiners. Any regional or local medical examiner appointed by the chief medical examiner shall have such jurisdiction within this state as designated by the chief medical examiner.
      </li>

       Except as otherwise provided in this article, it shall be in the sole discretion of the medical examiner to determine whether or not an autopsy or limited dissection is required; provided, however, that the medical examiner shall give due consideration to the opinions of the coroner and the peace officer in charge regarding the requirements of accepted investigation techniques and the rules of evidence applicable thereto.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c16s45-16-22ol1d">
       In the event that any local medical examiner or regional medical examiner is unable or unwilling to serve in any case, the coroner or the peace officer in charge may call upon the chief medical examiner, who shall perform a medical examiner's inquiry or direct another medical examiner to perform such inquiry.
      </li>

       For each external examination so performed, in cases where limited dissection or autopsy of the body is not required, the medical examiner shall receive the fee set in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 35-3-151. The fee in each case is to be paid from funds of the county in which the act was committed; or, if the county in which the act was committed is unknown, the fee shall be paid from funds of the county in which the body was found. In the event the place in which the act was committed is not known but is later established, the county in which the act was committed shall be responsible for payment of fees incurred by the medical examiner. Subject to funds being appropriated or otherwise available for such purpose, the chief medical examiner shall provide transportation of the deceased person to the site of the autopsy, if such autopsy is to be performed by a state or regional medical examiner employed by the state, and to return the body to the county where the death occurred.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c16s45-16-22ol1f">
       When death occurs in a hospital as a direct result and consequence of acts or events taking place in a county other than the one in which such death occurs, the body shall be returned to the county in which such acts or events took place. When a dead body is found in a county in which the acts or events leading to death did not occur, it shall be returned to the county in which the acts or events did occur, if known. The coroner or local medical examiner of the county in which such acts or events took place shall assume jurisdiction and the medical examiner's inquiry, if any performed, shall be paid for from funds of the county in which such acts or events took place.

      <li id="t45c16s45-16-22ol1g">
       In the event that a medical examiner's inquiry is performed by the chief medical examiner or an employee thereof, no fee therefor shall be imposed pursuant to this Code section. In the event that a medical examiner's inquiry is performed by a medical examiner regularly employed at a fixed compensation by any county or group of counties, no fee shall be imposed upon any county or group of counties employing that medical examiner at a fixed compensation.

As such photographs or video recordings are highly sensitive depictions of the deceased which, if viewed, copied, or publicized, could result in trauma, sorrow, humiliation, or emotional injury to the immediate family of the deceased, as well as injury to the memory of the deceased.

If two or more of such persons assume custody of the body, the consent of one of them shall be deemed sufficient legal authorization for the performance of the autopsy.

      When any person has been admitted to a hospital or morgue as a result of any casualty and for any reason whatsoever is unable to give his or her consent to the taking of a sample of blood for analytical purposes, the coroner or peace officer in charge of the investigation of the circumstances surrounding the casualty may notify a medical examiner for the purpose of obtaining a blood sample to test for the presence of intoxicating substances or in the case of a dead body and where appropriate for the presence of infectious agents. The blood may be drawn by the medical examiner or at the medical examiner's direction. The medical examiner or his or her designee shall be entitled to a fee set in accordance with Code Section 35-3-151 for performing these services, which fee shall be paid in the same manner as set out in Code Section 45-16-22. The peace officer may also request any licensed physician, nurse, emergency medical technician, medical or laboratory technician, or other qualified person to withdraw blood for purposes of this Code section, in which event such person shall incur no civil or criminal liability. The medical examiner or the peace officer in charge shall submit the blood specimens to the division for analysis; and a report shall be submitted by the division to the submitting officer.

        - The language of this section is clear and unambiguous; it is expressed in the disjunctive, and makes no distinction as to which notaries may use the words "State at Large," and which may use the words designating their county; the plain words of the statute give the election to any notary. In so doing, it is quite possible that the General Assembly intended that a notary whose activities, because of the notary's particular situation, would be confined to one county, would desire to identify with that particular county, whereas a notary whose situation would require travel over the state would desire to use the words "State at Large." 1957 Op.

       - At one time there appears to have been doubt as to the power of notaries to attest affidavits in this state. It was removed by the Act of 1863, codified in this section. That statute, however, was properly in part declaratory of a power already recognized. Simpson v. Wicker, <cite class="ga_court">120 Ga. 418</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E. 965</cite>, 1 Ann. Cas. 542 (1904).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An affidavit is sufficient as a basis for framing an accusation in a criminal court, although made before a commercial notary public; the question remains, however, whether such an affidavit would furnish a sufficient foundation for the issuance of an arrest warrant. Mitchell v. State, <cite class="ga_court">126 Ga. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E. 931</cite> (1906).

        Notaries public do not have authority

       - In attesting an affidavit in forma pauperis, accompanying a bill of exceptions, a notary public need not fix a seal, since it is not such a material act, under this section, as requires a seal for its authentication.

       - It was error to grant summary judgment to a caveator in a will contest in which the first of three witnesses signed both as a witness and as a notary. Even if the first witness did not intend to act as a witness, if the first witness and a second witness signed the will in the decedent's presence, then O.C.G.A.

       - Having established themselves as active officers and spokespersons for a recall effort, notaries public became more than generally interested electors. Hence, any recall petition pages with affidavits notarized by the notaries or either of them were properly disregarded. Howell v. Tidwell, <cite class="ga_court">258 Ga. 246</cite>, <cite class="app_court">368 S.E.2d 311</cite> (1988).

       A notary who circulated part of a nominating petition and also signed the petition was disqualified from notarizing circulators' affidavits on the petition, and it was proper to disqualify those pages with affidavits notarized by such person.

        - The State Personnel Board and the Governor, in their discretion, can assess any state department any amount for its employer contribution not to exceed 4 (now 5) percent of that department's "total outlay for personal services." That provision simply sets a maximum limit on the employer's contribution which may be charged. It does not mandate a 4 (now 5) percent across-the-board employer's contribution for all employees whether covered by health insurance or not. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-16.

        - The statutory authority of the State Personnel Board and the Governor to set the employer contribution is no longer constrained by a percentage cap in general law. However, the authority is constrained by the health plan statute itself to require the board to set the contribution for the year within amounts made available by the appropriations act. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-3.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the board sets the employer contribution, it must take into account the budget, which in June has been finalized by enactment of the new appropriations act. When the rate is set, employers in state government must pay it, but they know before the fiscal year commences that the rate will be, and it must be, consistent with the overall budget as set by the appropriations act. 1989 Op.

    - The General Assembly's adoption of the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 19, T. 45, providing a state remedy, enforceable in state courts following state administrative proceedings, does not and cannot preclude pursuit of a ripe and independent federal Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 action in state courts.

       - Federal decisions interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.
   ยง
   2000e et seq.) have consistently distinguished "disparate treatment" cases from cases involving facially neutral employment standards that have "disparate impact" on minority applicants. Georgia Bureau of Investigation v. Heard, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 895</cite>, <cite class="app_court">305 S.E.2d 670</cite> (1983).

       <p>
        <p>
       - In a "disparate impact" case, all that the aggrieved employee need prove to establish a prima-facie case of discrimination is that, regardless of intent to discriminate, the employer's otherwise facially neutral selection device screens out a disproportionate number of minorities. Once this is shown, the burden then shifts to the employer to demonstrate that, although it has discriminatory consequences, its facially neutral selection device is in fact job-related. Georgia Bureau of Investigation v. Heard, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 895</cite>, <cite class="app_court">305 S.E.2d 670</cite> (1983).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When dealing with subjective rather than facially-neutral and hence objective employment procedures, the case is to be treated as one involving "disparate treatment" wherein the employee's prima-facie case is shown by evidence that the subjective decision to deny the employee a promotion was racially motivated. The employer's rebuttal evidence must relate to defending the employee's subjective decision as having been based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. Georgia Bureau of Investigation v. Heard, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 895</cite>, <cite class="app_court">305 S.E.2d 670</cite> (1983).

        <p>
       - To establish a prima facie case of "disparate treatment" when discrimination on the basis of sex is alleged the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Kilmark v. Board of Regents, <cite class="ga_app_court">175 Ga. App. 857</cite>, <cite class="app_court">334 S.E.2d 890</cite> (1985).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Plaintiff can make out a prima-facie claim of "disparate treatment" by showing: (i) that the plaintiff belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that the plaintiff applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite the plaintiff's qualifications, the plaintiff was rejected; and (iv) that, after the plaintiff's rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons with the complainant's qualifications. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources v. Montgomery, <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 465</cite>, <cite class="app_court">284 S.E.2d 263</cite> (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Once plaintiff establishes a prima-facie case, discriminatory intent may be inferred
       
       absent articulation of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiff's rejection. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources v. Montgomery, <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 465</cite>, <cite class="app_court">284 S.E.2d 263</cite> (1981).

         Subjective evaluation against objective standards not "facially-neutral."
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the employer's relevant promotion device consisted of a panel of supervisors who subjectively evaluated and rated each applicant's qualifications against a number of objective standards, such subjective decision-making promotional system was not such a "facially-neutral" employment practice that the proof thereof - standing alone and without further evidence authorizing a finding of discriminatory intent - will establish a prima-facie case of employment discrimination under the "discriminatory impact" theory and thereby shift the burden of proof to the employer. Georgia Bureau of Investigation v. Heard, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 895</cite>, <cite class="app_court">305 S.E.2d 670</cite> (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Subjective promotion procedures are to be closely scrutinized
       
       because of their susceptibility to discriminatory abuse and the more subjective the qualification sought and the more subjective the manner in which it is measured, the more difficult will be the defendant's task in meeting defendant's burden.

     <ol class="alpha">
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1a">
       As used in this Code section, the term "respondent" means an employer charged with an alleged unlawful practice.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1b">
       An individual claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful practice or another person on behalf of an individual claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful practice may file with the administrator a written, sworn complaint stating that an unlawful practice has been committed setting forth the facts upon which the complaint is based and setting forth facts sufficient to enable the administrator to identify the employer charged. The administrator's staff shall promptly investigate the allegations of unlawful practice set forth in the complaint and, within 15 days of filing, shall serve the respondent with a copy of the complaint. The complaint shall be barred unless filed within 180 days after the alleged unlawful practice occurs.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1c">
       Within 90 days after the complaint has been filed, the administrator shall determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice. If it is determined that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the administrator shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1d">
       Within ten days after receiving a copy of the order dismissing the complaint, the complainant may file with the administrator an application for reconsideration of the order. Upon such application, the administrator shall determine within 15 days whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice. If it is again determined that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the administrator shall issue an order dismissing the complaint and notifying the complainant that such complainant has the right to request a right to bring an action letter from the appropriate federal agency or petition for review in the appropriate superior court as provided for in Code Section 45-19-39.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1e">
       After investigation or after the review provided for in subsection (d) of this Code section, if the administrator determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, then the administrator's staff shall first endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful practice by conference, conciliation, and persuasion. The terms of a conciliation agreement reached with a respondent may require the respondent to refrain from the commission of unlawful discriminatory practices in the future and make such further provisions as may be agreed upon between the administrator and the respondent. If a conciliation agreement is entered into, the administrator shall issue and serve on the complainant a final order stating its terms. Except for the terms of the conciliation agreement, neither the administrator nor any agent thereof shall make public without the written consent of the complainant and the respondent information concerning efforts in the particular case to eliminate an unlawful practice by conference, conciliation, or persuasion, whether or not there is a determination of reasonable cause or a conciliation agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1f">
       In the event the administrator determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that an agency or authority has engaged in an unlawful practice as defined in this article and the administrator's staff is unable to eliminate the alleged unlawful practice by conference, conciliation, and persuasion, the administrator shall refer the complaint to a special master as provided for in Code Section 45-19-37.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1g">
       At the expiration of one year from the date of a conciliation agreement and at other times in its reasonable discretion, the administrator's staff may investigate whether the terms of the agreement have been and are being complied with by the respondent. The administrator shall report the findings to the complainant and respondent. If the administrator finds reasonable cause to believe that the agreement has been breached, the complainant may seek enforcement of the agreement in the superior court of the county in which the alleged violation took place or in the county of the respondent's residence.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c19s45-19-36ol1h">
       The administrator shall issue to the complainant and the respondent, 90 days from the date the complaint was filed and every 30 days thereafter, a status report summarizing any action taken with respect to the complaint. The status reports required by this subsection shall be issued until final resolution of the complaint.

Not more than 15 working days after such request, the Governor shall select and appoint a special master who must be an attorney licensed to practice law in this state. The special master shall have all of the power and authority granted to agencies in conducting hearings and rendering final orders under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," including but not limited to subpoena power.

The respondent's answer must show by a certificate of service that the respondent has served a copy of the answer on the complainant or the complainant's attorney at the last known address of the complainant or the complainant's attorney where complainant is represented by an attorney. Upon leave of the special master, the complainant may amend the charges contained in the notice of hearing. The respondent may amend an answer at any time prior to the hearing or, upon leave of the special master, may amend thereafter. No final order shall be issued unless the respondent has had the opportunity of a hearing on the charges contained in the notice of hearing or amendment on which the final order is based. If the respondent fails to answer the complaint, the special master may enter the respondent's default. Unless the default is set aside for good cause shown, the hearing may proceed on the evidence in support of the complaint.

       Any party to a hearing before a special master or a complainant whose complaint has been dismissed by the administrator may appeal any adverse final order of a special master by filing a petition for review in the superior court in the county in which the alleged unlawful practice occurred or in the superior court of the residence of the respondent within 30 days of the issuance of the final order. Neither the administrator nor the special master shall be a named party; however, the administrator must be served with a copy of the petition for review. Within 30 days after the petition is served on the administrator, the administrator shall forward to the court a certified copy of the record of the hearing before the special master, including the transcript of the hearing before the special master and all evidence, administrative pleadings, and orders, or the entire record if no hearing has been held. For good cause shown, the court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record. All appeals for judicial review shall be in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act"; provided, however, that if any provisions of Chapter 13 of Title 50 conflict with any provision of this article, this article controls. An individual employed by the administrator pursuant to paragraph (3) of Code Section 45-19-27 shall not have the authority to represent the complainant in any appeal to superior court of a final order of the special master or in any proceeding in any court, except to secure judicial enforcement of preliminary procedural orders of a special master.

       The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the special master as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm a final order of the special master or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the final order if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:

       It is the purpose of this article to establish in the state a system of personnel administration which will attract, select, and retain the best employees based on merit, free from coercive political influences, with incentives in the form of equal opportunities for all; which will provide technically competent and loyal personnel to render impartial service to the public at all times and to render such service according to the dictates of ethics and morality; and which will remove unnecessary and inefficient employees. It is specifically the intent of the General Assembly to promote this purpose by allowing agencies greater flexibility in personnel management so as to promote the overall effectiveness and efficiency of state government. To this end, and in accordance with Code Sections 45-20-2 and 45-20-6, all positions filled after July 1, 1996, shall be included in the unclassified service as defined in this article, except as provided in Code Section 15-11-69. It is also specifically the intent of the General Assembly that employees in the classified service prior to July 1, 1996, shall continue to be employees in the classified service so long as they remain in classified positions or as otherwise provided by law. It is further specifically the intent of the General Assembly that state government operate within a framework of consistent core personnel policies and practices across all state agencies and entities and that the state's most valued resource, its employees, be managed in a manner to promote work force productivity and sound business practices.

        <p>
       - Trial court did not err when the court held that the State Personnel Board exceeded the board's authority in adopting regulations authorizing an administrative law judge to resolve an appeal from the board's termination of a classified state employee without holding an evidentiary hearing because the regulation at issue, Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x), did not comport with the Georgia Merit System Act, O.C.G.A.

       - When the State Personnel Board, in reviewing the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) decreasing the sanction imposed on a state employee from dismissal to a 30-day suspension, reimposed the dismissal, it was error for a trial court to find that the board's decision was not supported by a sufficient rationale; the board properly adopted findings and conclusions of the ALJ which were consistent with the board's own decision and then explained that the ALJ's recommended sanction was too lenient for the proved misconduct, as the misconduct was so severe as to warrant dismissal, so the board's decision was within the board's broad authority to impose sanctions on state employees under O.C.G.A.

       Denial of an evidentiary hearing
      
      on a state trooper's claims that the trooper was harmed due to personal favoritism, cronyism and arbitrary decision-making within the Department of Public Safety was an abdication of the State Personnel Board's discretion and was contrary to law, arbitrary, and capricious.

      Trial court did not err when the court held that the State Personnel Board exceeded its authority in adopting regulations authorizing an administrative law judge to resolve an appeal from the board's termination of a classified state employee without holding an evidentiary hearing because the regulation at issue, Ga. Pers. Bd. R. &amp; Regs., Reg. 478-1-.24(6)(e) and (x), did not comport with the Georgia Merit System Act, O.C.G.A.

       - When the plaintiff, who was demoted by the employer, Georgia Retardation Center, a division of the Department of Human Resources (DHR), pursued administrative remedies, culminating in the denial of the plaintiff's appeal by the State Personnel Board, and then petitioned the superior court for judicial review, it was held that the plaintiff's employer is governed by the Georgia Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but the decision of which plaintiff seeks review is one made not by DHR but by the State Personnel Board, which is not governed by the APA, but by the provisions of O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - The superior court had jurisdiction to hear and decide an appeal by a state employee from a determination of the board that it lacked jurisdiction over the person of the employee; the board's determination was final in that it denied the employee an ability to obtain a hearing before the board and, thus, the court was authorized to render a final decision in the case and issue an order thereon.

       The trial court erred in reversing the dismissals of two correctional officers for use of excessive force against an inmate since the terminations were supported by some evidence, and there was no abuse of discretion in the board's failure to impose less severe punishment.

        <p>
       When the State Personnel Board, in reviewing the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) decreasing the sanction imposed on a state employee from dismissal to a 30-day suspension, reimposed the dismissal, it was error for a trial court to find that the board's decision was not supported by a sufficient rationale; the board had properly adopted findings and conclusions of the ALJ which were consistent with the board's own decision and then explained that the ALJ's recommended sanction was too lenient for the proved misconduct as the misconduct was so severe as to warrant dismissal so the board's decision was not arbitrary and capricious under O.C.G.A.

If the applicant provides appropriate documentation and the medical review officer determines that it was a legitimate usage of the substance, the result shall be reported as negative. Any applicant who fails to provide an alternative medical explanation shall be reported by the medical review officer as having a positive test result. Any applicant offered employment who refuses to submit to an established test for illegal drugs or whose test results are positive shall be disqualified from employment by the state. Such disqualification shall not be removed for a period of two years from the date that such test was administered or offered, whichever is later. The board shall develop rules for the administration of the test and any verification procedures. Other covered units of state government shall also develop rules governing these procedures. The results of such tests shall remain confidential and shall not be a public record unless necessary for the administration of these provisions or otherwise mandated by other state or federal law.

       <p>
        The employers covered by O.C.G.A. Ch. 22, T. 45 include entities of state government, and the employees covered are state employees.
   Therefore, the law covers state operated colleges and hospitals and their employees (including student employees of state colleges).
   However, the law does not cover the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, local (city or county) school systems, private colleges, municipalities, counties or nonstate operated hospitals that receive state financial support; nor does the law cover employees of these nonstate employers. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-45.

       awaiting transfers to state penal institutions would not be covered by O.C.G.A. Ch. 22, T. 45 until they are placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections.
   However, prisoners punished for misdemeanors could be confined in a county correctional institution and still be under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections.
   Under these circumstances, the Department of Corrections would be a covered employer and the prisoners would be covered employees; however, since the county correctional institution is not wholly owned or controlled by the Department of Corrections, it would not be a covered "workplace" as defined in O.C.G.A.

      The General Assembly finds that the manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs in an unlawful manner is a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. It is declared to be a primary purpose and goal of this state, of all of its agencies and instrumentalities, and of all of its public officials and employees to take all reasonable steps possible to eradicate the unlawful manufacture, distribution, sale, and possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs. With this purpose in mind, the General Assembly declares that its work force must be absolutely free of any person who would knowingly manufacture, distribute, sell, or possess a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug in an unlawful manner.For this reason, the General Assembly enacts this chapter.
