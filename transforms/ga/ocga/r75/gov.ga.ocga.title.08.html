      The General Assembly finds that an adequate supply of clean drinking water is a precious and essential resource upon which life depends.The General Assembly further finds that the average annual per capita consumption of potable water due to indoor water-using activities in the United States exceeds 18,000 gallons and that the demand for clean water supplies continues to increase despite the limitations of availability and affordability of such supplies.The General Assembly further finds that technology is available to improve the efficiency of plumbing products.

      The legislature finds, declares, and determines that Georgia needs an alternative method to resolve legitimate construction disputes that would reduce the need for litigation while adequately protecting the rights of homeowners. The legislature declares that an effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism in certain construction defect matters should involve the claimant filing a notice of claim with the contractor that the claimant asserts is responsible for the defect and providing the contractor with the opportunity to resolve the claim without litigation.

The notice of claim shall state that the claimant asserts a construction defect claim or claims and is providing notice of the claim or claims pursuant to the requirements of this part. The notice of claim shall describe the claim or claims in detail sufficient to explain the nature of the alleged construction defects and the results of the defects. In addition, the claimant shall provide to the contractor any evidence that depicts the nature and cause of the construction defect, including expert reports, photographs, and videotapes, if that evidence would be discoverable under evidentiary rules.

       Within 30 days after service of the notice of claim by a claimant required in subsection (a) of this Code section, each contractor that has received the notice of claim shall serve on the claimant, and on any other contractor that has received the notice of claim, a written response to the claim or claims, which either:

       If the contractor wholly rejects the claim and will neither remedy the alleged construction defect nor settle the claim or does not respond to the claimant's notice of claim within the time stated in subsection (b) of this Code section, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the claims described in the notice of claim without further notice except as otherwise provided under applicable law. A contractor that does not respond to a notice of claim within the time prescribed by subsection (b) of this Code section may not claim or assert that the absence of documents required to be provided with the notice of claim under subsection (a) of this Code section relieved the contractor from the contractor's obligation to respond to the notice of claim.

       If the claimant rejects the settlement offer made by the contractor, the claimant shall provide written notice of the claimant's rejection to the contractor and, if represented by legal counsel, his or her attorney. The notice shall include the reasons for the claimant's rejection of the contractor's proposal or offer. If the claimant believes that the settlement offer:

If destructive testing is required, the contractor shall give claimant advance notice of such tests and shall, after completion of the testing, return the dwelling or common area to its pretesting condition. If any inspection or testing reveals a condition that requires additional testing to allow the contractor to fully and completely evaluate the nature, cause, and extent of the construction defect, the contractor shall provide notice to the claimant of the need for such additional testing and the claimant shall provide prompt and reasonable access as set forth in this Code section. If a claim is asserted on behalf of owners of multiple dwellings or multiple owners of units within a multifamily complex, the contractor shall be entitled to inspect each of the dwellings or common areas which may be or appear to be affected by the alleged defect. The contractor shall commence and diligently pursue completion of all the desired inspections within the 30 day period after delivery of the contractor's written proposal. Inspection shall be completed within the same 30 day period if reasonable or within a reasonable period thereafter if completion is not reasonable within 30 days.

In such a situation, the claimant may also file the contractor's offer and claimant's acceptance, and such offer and acceptance will create a rebuttable presumption that a binding and valid settlement agreement has been created and should be enforced by the court or arbitrator.

       If a claimant rejects a reasonable offer, including any reasonable supplemental offer, made as provided by this part or does not permit the contractor to repair the construction defect pursuant to an accepted offer of settlement, the claimant may not recover an amount in excess of:
       <ol>
        <li id="t08c02s8-2-38ol1l1">
         The fair market value of the offer of settlement or the actual cost of the repairs made; or

NINETY DAYS BEFORE YOU FILE YOUR LAWSUIT OR OTHER ACTION, YOU MUST SERVE ON THE CONTRACTOR A WRITTEN NOTICE OF ANY CONSTRUCTION CONDITIONS YOU ALLEGE ARE DEFECTIVE.

       - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellees, a transit authority and a corporation, in a suit by an escalator rider. Based on testimony from the rider's expert that the appellees' failure to properly maintain the escalator caused the incident and from an on-call mechanic who deposed that there clearly was a problem with the unit after the incident but that the mechanic did not contact an inspector despite knowing that the rider had been injured, there was a factual issue as to whether the appellees spoliated evidence by violating O.C.G.A.

      The General Assembly finds that, in an effort to meet the building needs within the state, the private construction industry has developed mass production techniques which can substantially reduce construction costs and that the mass production of buildings presents unique problems with respect to the establishment of uniform health and safety standards and inspection procedures. The General Assembly further finds that, by minimizing the problems of standards and inspection procedures, it is demonstrating its intention to encourage the reduction of building construction costs and to make building and home ownership more feasible for all residents of the state.

This article is not mandatory or binding on local enforcement authorities; provided, however, that any local building, fire, life safety, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, or other construction code enforcement authority may apply the applicable provisions of this article to any existing building whenever the local governing authority has adopted this article by reference and whenever such local code enforcement authority determines the need to utilize compliance alternatives to any provisions of the rules, regulations, codes, or standards he or she is empowered to interpret, apply, or enforce under authority of any state law or local ordinance. This article is a tool for use of code enforcement authorities to use as deemed appropriate in attempting to resolve problems encountered while enforcing codes and standards with regard to existing buildings and structures. Enforcement authorities should advise appropriate appeals boards of the provisions, purposes, and intent of this article.

      It is declared that there exist in the state unsanitary and unsafe dwelling accommodations; that persons of low income are forced to reside in such accommodations; that within the state there is a shortage of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are therefore forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the state and impair economic values; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection and other public services and facilities; that these distressed areas cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved, solely through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income, as such persons are defined in Code Section 8-3-3, would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise; that the clearance, replanning, and reconstruction of the areas in which unsanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired; and that it is in the public interest that work on such projects be commenced as soon as possible in order to relieve unemployment which now constitutes an emergency. The necessity in the public interest for the provisions enacted in this article is declared as a matter of legislative determination.

      It is declared to be the policy of this state that each housing authority shall manage and operate its housing projects or, in the event of its use of a private enterprise agreement, shall cause each housing project subject thereto to be managed and operated in an efficient manner so as to enable it to fix the rentals for dwelling accommodations for persons of low income at the lowest possible rates consistent with its providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income, and that no housing authority shall construct or operate the dwelling accommodations in any such project that are occupied or reserved for occupancy by persons of low income for a profit or as a source of revenue to the city or the county. To this end, an authority shall fix the rentals for those dwelling accommodations in such housing projects that are occupied or reserved for occupancy by persons of low income at no higher rates than it shall find necessary in order to produce revenues which, together with all other available moneys, revenues, income, and receipts of the authority from whatever sources derived, will be sufficient:

       The great increase in population in the State of Georgia which has taken place in recent years has created a serious shortage in dormitory housing accommodations at the various units of the University System of Georgia, causing overcrowded and congested conditions which are unsafe and undesirable and seriously impair the proper operation of such institutions. In addition, at some institutions now in operation or in the process of construction, there is a total lack of dormitory housing accommodations. This situation constitutes an emergency; and it is imperative that provisions be made to alleviate the overcrowded, congested, and unsafe accommodations and to supply accommodations where the same are now nonexistent by the construction of dormitory facilities or additional facilities for such institutions so as to make adequate, safe, and uncongested dormitory housing available for students enrolled at such institutions.
      </li>
      <li id="t08c03s8-3-17ol1b">
       Any housing authority now or hereafter established may undertake the construction, acquisition, remodeling, and improvement of, the addition to, and the maintenance and operation of projects to provide dormitory housing at any unit of the University System of Georgia located within its area of operation so as to provide housing for students enrolled at such institution, if the authority finds and determines that an acute shortage of housing for such persons exists or impends in its area of operation or any part thereof, and that necessary and adequate housing would not otherwise be provided when needed. In the ownership, development, or administration of dormitory housing projects, a housing authority shall have all the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities that it may now or hereafter have under any provision of law relating to the ownership, development, and administration of low rent housing and slum clearance projects or any other projects it is now or hereafter authorized to undertake, in the same manner as though all laws applicable thereto were applicable to dormitory housing projects. Such rights shall include specifically, but without limitation, the right to issue bonds from time to time, in the authority's discretion, in order to provide funds to pay the cost, in whole or in part, of constructing, acquiring, remodeling, improving, and adding to any dormitory housing project; and the right to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding or retiring bonds previously issued by the authority for any such project. Such bonds may be of such type as the housing authority may determine, including bonds on which the principal and interest are payable:
       <ol>
        <li id="t08c03s8-3-17ol1b1">
         Exclusively from the income and revenues of the dormitory project financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds, or with such proceeds together with a grant from the federal government or the State of Georgia, or from any other source in aid of such project;
        </li>
        <li id="t08c03s8-3-17ol1b2">
         Exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated projects of the authority, including projects other than dormitory housing projects of the authority even though the same were not financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of the bonds; or

        <li id="t08c03s8-3-17ol1b3">
         From its revenues generally that are not otherwise pledged or obligated.
         <p>
          Any of such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any revenues of any project or projects or other properties of the authority. A housing authority may, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, make and agree to make with respect to any dormitory housing project owned and administered by it under this article such payments as may be agreed upon for facilities and services furnished to such dormitory housing project by the city, county, or other political subdivision of the state in which such dormitory housing project is located, or by the unit of the University System of Georgia which such dormitory housing project serves. In the operation of such dormitory housing projects the housing authority owning and administering the same shall not be subject to the limitations provided in Code Section 8-3-12, in the second sentence of Code Section 8-3-11, and in Code Section 8-3-74.

      </li>
      <li id="t08c03s8-3-17ol1c">
       A housing authority may exercise any or all of its powers to aid or cooperate with the state and federal governments in making dormitory housing available at units of the University System of Georgia, may act as agent for the state or federal governments in developing and administering dormitory housing projects undertaken by either of them, and may lease such dormitory housing projects from either of them. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, authority is also specifically granted to the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, for and on behalf of the units and institutions under its control, and any housing authority to enter into leases of any such project or projects for a term of not exceeding 50 years; and the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, for and on behalf of any unit or institution or combination of units or institutions, may obligate itself to pay an agreed sum for the use of such property so leased and also to obligate itself, as a part of the lease contract, to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the property so leased from the authority, and may arrange with public bodies and private agencies for such services and facilities as may be necessary or desirable for such dormitory housing projects.
      </li>
      <li id="t08c03s8-3-17ol1d">
       Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia and a housing authority determine it expedient to construct any dormitory housing project on any lands, title to which is held by any unit or institution under the control of the board of regents, the board is authorized to execute a lease upon such lands, whether improved or unimproved, to the authority for such parcel or parcels as shall be needed for a period of not to exceed 50 years at such annual rental, which may be purely nominal, as the board and the housing authority may agree upon, provided that, at the expiration of such term, title to said land and all improvements thereon shall revert to and vest in such unit or institution under the control of said board. The board of regents shall also have the right, any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, should it determine with the housing authority that it is necessary and desirable to do so, to convey, by a deed executed by the chairman of the board of regents upon resolution of said board, for such consideration as may be agreed upon (which consideration may be nominal), to a housing authority for a dormitory housing project title to any land, whether improved or unimproved, owned by any unit or institution under its control which is to be served by such dormitory housing project, including land to which the regents of the University System of Georgia hold title, provided that title to such land and all improvements thereon shall revert or be reconveyed by the housing authority to such unit or institution when all bonds, and the interest thereon, which were issued by the housing authority to finance such construction, or bonds issued to refinance such obligations, or to finance in whole or in part any additions or improvements thereto, have been paid in full.

       Any action to protect or enforce any right in connection with the construction, acquisition, ownership, maintenance, alteration, expansion, improvement, or operation of dormitory housing projects, or involving any question in connection with the issuance of bonds to finance any such undertaking, or with the rights of the holders thereof or the security therefor, shall be brought in the superior court of the county in which the dormitory housing project is located. Any action pertaining to the validation of any bonds issued to finance in whole or in part the cost of any such dormitory housing project or any refunding bonds shall likewise be brought in said court, which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.

      <li id="t08c03s8-3-17ol1f">
       Bonds of the authority issued to finance in whole or in part the cost of any dormitory housing project and any refunding bonds shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure set forth in Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36, the "Revenue Bond Law," and the judgment of validation shall have the same effect as is provided in that chapter.

Each such resolution shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is need for the regional housing authority and finds in substantially such terms as appear in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of Code Section 8-3-102, no further detail being necessary, that the conditions enumerated in those paragraphs exist.

       - The language of this Code section was enacted by a 1943 amendment to Ga. L. 1937, p. 210, and was designated by Section 4B of the 1937 Act. The 1937 Act was amended further by Ga. L. 1952, p. 365,
   §
   1, which repealed Section 4B and enacted a new Section 4B. However, the new Section 4B contained language which wholly repeated the language of the original Section 4B. Since the 1952 Act thus did not have the practical effect of repealing the language of the original Section 4B, the 1943 amendment (Ga. L. 1943, p. 146,
   §
   6) is being treated as the sole basis for this Code section. The remainder of the language of the Section 4B enacted by the 1952 Act is codified at Code Sections 8-3-111 through 8-3-118.

       The preparation for national defense requires a great migration of persons to engage in national defense industries and activities which would be jeopardized unless housing is available for such persons. An acute shortage of housing for such persons exists or impends in localities in the state. It is therefore of vital importance that all agencies qualified to do so have the powers and authority to develop and administer projects to provide housing for persons engaged in war or national defense activities and to aid and cooperate with the federal government in making such housing available for such persons.

      It has been found and declared in Article 1 of this chapter, the "Housing Authorities Law," that there exist in the state unsafe and insanitary housing conditions and a shortage of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities; and that the public interest requires the remedying of these conditions. It is found and declared that the assistance provided in this article for the remedying of the conditions set forth in Article 1 of this chapter constitutes a public use and purpose and an essential governmental function for which public moneys may be spent, and that the provisions hereinafter enacted are necessary in the public interest.

    - Former Georgia Residential Finance Authority Act was not unconstitutional on the ground that the state may not make loans since the funds used to carry out the purposes of the authority were derived from the sale of the authority's revenue bonds, and was thus private, not public, money.

     <ol>
      <li id="t08c04s8-4-2ol11">
       That there exist in many communities within this state blighted areas, as defined in Code Section 8-4-3, or areas in the process of becoming blighted;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c04s8-4-2ol12">
       That such areas impair economic values and tax revenues; that such areas cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the state; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities;

       That the clearance, replanning, and preparation for rebuilding of these areas and the prevention of the reduction of blight and its causes are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c04s8-4-2ol14">
       That there are also certain areas where the condition of the title, the diverse ownership of the land to be assembled, the street or lot layouts, or other conditions prevent a proper development of the land; that it is in the public interest that such areas, as well as blighted areas, be acquired by eminent domain and made available for sound and wholesome development in accordance with a redevelopment plan; and that the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the financing of the acquisition and preparation of land by a public agency for such redevelopment is likewise a public use and purpose;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c04s8-4-2ol15">
       That redevelopment activities will stimulate residential construction which is closely correlated with general economic activity; and that such undertakings authorized by this chapter will aid the production of better housing and more desirable neighborhood and community development at lower costs and will make possible a more stable and larger volume of residential construction, which will assist materially in achieving and maintaining full employment;
      </li>

In undertaking such redevelopment projects, a housing authority shall have all the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities that such authority has under Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title, the "Housing Authorities Law," and any other provision of law relating to slum clearance and housing projects for persons of low income, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the power to make and execute contracts, to issue bonds and other obligations and give security therefor, to acquire real property by eminent domain or purchase, and to do any and all things necessary to carry out projects in the same manner as though all of the provisions of law applicable to slum clearance and housing projects were applicable to redevelopment projects undertaken under this chapter, provided that nothing contained in Code Sections 8-3-11 and 8-3-12 shall be construed as limiting the power of an authority, in the event of a default by a purchaser or lessee of land in a redevelopment plan, to acquire property and operate it free from the restrictions contained in said Code sections.
