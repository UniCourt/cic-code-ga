Copies of any such order of the department shall be served upon all parties by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested.

Any fine under this subsection shall be tolled for the period from the filing of a petition for a judicial review and shall be subject to judicial review in such manner as is provided by law for judicial review of contested cases under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," until the rendering of a final decision.

        <p>
       - When at least 75 flights were made over plaintiff's school building daily at altitudes of 50 to 75 feet, which was just over the treetops, and when the danger necessarily created thereby to the lives and safety of those occupying the premises, the noise and vibration caused thereby, and the distracting effect on the students made further operation of the plaintiff's school impracticable, such substantially lessened the right to enjoy freely the use of the property and a continuing nuisance was established which equity would enjoin.

        <p>
       - Ga. L. 1933, p. 102 vests in each municipality the same general authority, that is, each is given power to condemn land within and without the municipality's boundaries, and accordingly each is by terms of statute vested with jurisdiction over every part of the state, including territory within limits of every other municipality. Howard v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Grant of power to municipalities to condemn property within and without their geographical limits authorizes one municipality to condemn land within territorial limits of another municipality. Howard v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ga. L. 1933, p. 102 authorizes municipalities to condemn land beyond their limits for establishment or expansion of airports and landing fields. Howard v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1940) (see O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 3, T. 6).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While Ga. L. 1933, p. 102 prima facie empowers one municipality to condemn land within another municipality, it does not follow that a municipality in one part of state would have right to establish airport in a municipality in a distant part of the state. This would manifestly be an abuse of power granted, which would be enjoined by courts. Howard v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1940) (see O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 3, T. 6).

       Grant of power to municipalities to condemn property within and without their geographical limits authorizes one municipality to condemn land within territorial limits of another municipality. Howard v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While this article prima facie empowers one municipality to condemn land within another municipality, it does not follow that a municipality in one part of state would have right to establish airport in a municipality in a distant part of the state. This would manifestly be an abuse of power granted, which would be enjoined by courts. Howard v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1940) (see O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 3, T. 6).

        <p>
       - If condemning municipality acts in good faith within power granted under statutory terms, and there is a reasonable necessity for appropriation of property, the fact that other municipality may be deprived of right to tax or police property so taken is merely express result of exercise of power so granted, and does not constitute reason why the article should be construed as denying the power.

Such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times not more than 40 years from their respective dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time, shall be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide.The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the members of the authority then in office and their successors. The authority shall have the power from time to time and whenever it deems refunding expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and may issue partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this chapter.The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which the authority may issue. Any limitations with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in the usury laws of the State of Georgia, or any other laws of the State of Georgia, shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority.
