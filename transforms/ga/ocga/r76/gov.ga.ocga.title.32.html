        Georgia DOT is an arm of the state
       
       and thus may have immunity under the Eleventh Amendment because any recovery would have been paid out of state funds and the fact that Georgia DOT can allocate the DOT's funds in DOT's own discretion and without intervention by the state legislature does not change the fact that these funds are state funds.

       - When the charge in question does in fact state that the Department of Transportation has "general responsibility to design, manage and improve the state highway system," it seems to capture the essence of the sections the defendant relies upon, which are in fact very broad, general descriptions of the duties of the DOT.

       - Logical disposition of any money recovered in an action for the destruction of a bridge on a public highway which is to continue in use would be to use the money for the purpose of restoring the destroyed bridge, or where the bridge has already been rebuilt, to use the money to replace, as nearly as possible, those funds which the Highway Department (now Department of Transportation) expended in restoring the bridge.

       The department shall have the authority to contract as set forth in this article and in Code Section 32-2-2. All department construction contracts shall be in writing. Any contract entered into by the department for the construction of a public road shall include, as a cost of the project, provisions for sowing vegetation, if appropriate, on all banks, fills, cuts, ditches, and other places where soil erosion is likely to result from the necessary incidents to road work along the right of way of the road project.

       Persons, firms, or corporations submitting bids on department construction contracts are required to examine the site of the proposed work and determine for themselves the anticipated subsurface and latent physical conditions at the site prior to submitting a bid on the project. The submission of a bid shall be prima-facie evidence that the bidder has made such examination and is satisfied as to the conditions to be encountered in performing the work. The department does not in any way guarantee the amount or nature of subsurface materials which may be encountered and which must be excavated, graded, or driven through in performing the work on the project. The contractor shall not plead deception or misunderstanding because of variations from quantities of work to be performed or materials to be furnished as shown on the plans or minor variations from the locations or character of the work. Payment will be made only for actual quantities of work performed in accordance with the plans and specifications. The department shall not provide compensation above the amount bid on such project solely due to the encountering of subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which are different from those anticipated by the bidder.

       - Department of Transportation is prohibited from maintaining a road after the road is transferred from the state highway system and the department owed no duty to plaintiff who was injured in an accident on the road.

        <p>
       When an injured party sued the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) for injuries received in a single-car accident on a county road, the party could not maintain a negligent maintenance claim against DOT because the road on which the accident occurred was not part of the state highway system, nor did the road lead to a state park; thus, under O.C.G.A.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t32c04s32-4-41ol11" target="_self">32-4-41(1)</a></cite>, the county was obligated to maintain the road and, under O.C.G.A.

Public notice of such request for proposal shall be made at least 90 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals by posting the legal notice on a single website that shall be procured and maintained for such purposes by the Department of Administrative Services or in substantially the same manner utilized by the department to solicit requests for proposals.

In the event that any local governing authority has agreed to consider financial participation in the project, a representative of such local governing authority, appointed by such local governing authority, may participate in such discussions and interviews. At the discussion stage, the department may discuss estimates of total project costs, including, but not limited to, life cycle costing and nonbinding estimates of price for services. Proprietary information from competing respondents shall not be disclosed to the public or to competitors. At the conclusion of such discussions, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request for proposal and all information developed in the selection process, the department, with the input of any participating local governing authority, shall select in the order of preference two or more respondents whose qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. Negotiations shall then be conducted with two or more respondents and with the participation of the designated representative of any participating local governing authority. Upon approval by the department, the commissioner shall select the respondent for project implementation based upon contract terms that are the most satisfactory and advantageous to the state and to the department based upon a thorough assessment of value and the ability of the final project's characteristics to meet state strategic goals and investment policies as provided for by paragraphs (1) through (10) of subsection (a) of Code Section 32-2-41.1. Before making such selection, the commissioner shall consult with any participating local governing authority or authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms and conditions for multiple awards are included in the request for proposal, the department may award contracts to more than one respondent. Should the department determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one respondent is fully qualified, or that one respondent is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that respondent.

Design-build contracts may be advertised and awarded notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Code Section 32-2-61. However, construction activities shall not begin on any portion of such projects until title to the necessary rights of way and easements for the construction of that portion of the project has vested in the state or a local governmental entity and all railroad crossing and utility agreements have been executed.

           From the list of qualified firms as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a technical proposal and a price proposal from each firm from which the department shall select the lowest qualified bidder or, in the event the department uses the best value procurement process, the request for proposal shall specify the requirements necessary for the selection of the best value proposer which shall include, at a minimum, a weighted cost component and a technical component. A proposal shall only be considered nonresponsive if it does not contain all the information and level of detail requested in the request for proposal. A proposal shall not be deemed to be nonresponsive solely on the basis of minor irregularities in the proposal that do not directly affect the ability to fairly evaluate the merits of the proposal. Notwithstanding the requirements of Code Section 36-91-21, under no circumstances shall the department use a "best and final offer" standard in awarding a contract in order to induce one proposer to bid against an offer of another proposer. The department may provide for a stipulated fee to be awarded to the short list of qualified proposers who provide a responsive, successful proposal. In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the department may use any ideas or information contained in the proposals in connection with the contract awarded for the project, or in connection with a subsequent procurement, without obligation to pay any additional compensation to the unsuccessful proposers;

The department shall have the authority to suspend or provide for the suspension of Section 108 of the department's standard specifications pending final resolution of such contract issues and disputes.

        <p>
       - Where the owners of a tract of land subdivide the tract into lots, record a map or plat showing such lots, with designated streets and a public park, and sell lots with reference to such map or plat, the owners are presumed to have irrevocably dedicated such streets and park for the use of all of the lot owners in the subdivision.

        <p>
       Governing authority can acquire fee-simple title to a county road only through condemnation or an express grant in a deed or other instrument. When a road is established by dedication and there is no express grant of fee-simple title, an easement results. Northpark Assocs. No. 2 v. Homard Dev.

       - In order to recover from a county for a taking, the plaintiff must show that the taking was done for a public purpose of the county; however, nothing appearing to the contrary, the allegation that the county took the property as part of a right of way for a road and street within the municipality and while acting in the conduct of the county's business sufficiently alleged the right of the county to condemn the land in question.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the condemnee introduced evidence to show that, because of the condemnation, the condemnee would be required to expend certain amounts on fences, screening hedges, and grading, and thus would be consequentially damaged, and there was no evidence as to any consequential benefits resulting from the improvement, the evidence did not authorize a charge on consequential benefits.

       - When the state has specifically condemned access rights to a proposed highway, and when the highway will result in a loss of access to part of the condemnee's land, a charge which designates the condemnation of access rights as an element of compensation for the taking and the loss of access as an element of consequential damages, does not authorize a double award for the same thing.

       - In condemnation proceedings, the only issue before the assessors or a jury on appeal is the amount of compensation to be paid, and neither the assessors nor a jury can determine whether the condemnor is proceeding legally; the remedy of the landowners is to apply to a court of equity to enjoin the illegal proceedings.

       - Affirmative action seeking to set aside judgment in favor of condemnor, and payment of all expenses and damages accrued to the condemnee, are essential to the vacating and setting aside of a judgment for the value of property condemned.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since previous donation by condemnee had no relevance to the determination of the amount of just and adequate compensation for the property taken, references by condemnee's president to that previous donation as having been "forced" and "coerced" implied that condemnor had acted in bad faith; thus, the testimony by condemnee's president was both irrelevant and prejudicial.

       - Jury was authorized to determine that evidence of comparable sales in the area of a landowner's land, even though higher than the landowner's expert's opinion of the market value of the acreage, reasonably established the value of the land, and it could fix the market value of the land higher or lower than that amount asserted by an expert, provided that the jury's verdict was not so disparate as to justify an inference of gross mistake or undue bias; thus, when the evidence supported the jury's award, there was no inference that it was the result of gross mistake or undue bias.

       Since a private road had been blocked and impassable for more than 10 years, there could not have been continuous use of the road for 7 years and, therefore, there could be no prescriptive rights in the road.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When an established dedication is claimed, the acts relied on to establish the dedication must be such as to clearly and satisfactorily indicate a purpose on the part of the owner to abandon the owner's personal dominion over the property and to devote the property to a definite public use. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

        <p>
       In order to constitute a dedication of land to public uses, an intention on the part of the owner to abandon the use of the land to the public must be shown by proof of unequivocal and unambiguous words or acts of such owner; the circumstances must be such as to show a clear assent to such dedication. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - While an intention to dedicate need not be shown by an express declaration to that effect, but may be inferred under certain circumstances from an acquiescence by the owner in the use of the owner's property by the public, such acquiescence is in the nature of an estoppel in pais, and implies a knowledge on the part of the owner of the claim by the public to the right to appropriate the owner's property to the public use.

        <p>
       - Occasional road-working of property by public authorities, there being no other evidence of maintenance, is not of itself sufficient to create the presumption of an intention to dedicate; the use and maintenance must be of the character and for the length of time sufficient to create a presumptive right of the public therein.

        Mere use of one's property by a small portion of the public,
       
       even for an extended period of time, is not sufficient to authorize an inference that the property has been dedicated to a public use, unless it clearly appears that there was an intention to dedicate, and that this dedication was accepted by the public authorities, either in express terms or by implication resulting from the maintenance of a way public in its nature.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Before a highway can be established by prescription, it must appear that the general public, under a claim of right, and not by mere permission of the owner, used some defined way without interruption or substantial change, for a period of 20 years or more; the use must not only be adverse, but the use must be continuous and uninterrupted, although it is not every slight or occasional use of the land by the owner that will constitute an interruption of the public use. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When there is no other evidence against the owner to support a dedication but the mere fact of such use, so that the right claimed by the public is purely prescriptive, it is essential, to maintain it, that the use or enjoyment should be adverse, that is with a claim of right, and uninterrupted and exclusive for the requisite length of time. Dunaway v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1944) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Since there was no intention to dedicate, but the public has taken possession of the property of an individual, and used and maintained the property as a highway for a period of 20 years or more, a highway by prescription becomes complete; when there was an intention to dedicate, the maintenance of a way for a less time will bring into existence a completed highway by dedication.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In a condemnation action wherein a county challenged the valuation placed on the landowner's property, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by allowing the admission of four deeds of sale on other properties as direct evidence of the condemned property's value since a proper foundation was laid for the deeds and dissimilarities in the land went to the weight of the evidence of the deeds, not the admissibility of the deeds.

        <p>
       Trial court erred in dismissing the Georgia Department of Transportation's (DOT's) condemnation petition for the department's failure to submit a properly attested affidavit with the department's petition as the condemnees were estopped from challenging the taking of the condemnees' property because the condemnees withdrew the money deposited by DOT in the court registry.

        <p>
       - Condemnees were entitled to a new trial in a Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) condemnation proceeding; the trial court erred in refusing to allow impeachment of the DOT expert with the disparity between the expert's pretrial estimate of just compensation (JC) and the higher estimate the expert gave at trial as impeachment might have convinced the jury to award JC closer to the higher JC estimate of the condemnees' expert.

       Because a condemnee did not claim lost profits or business losses, the trial court properly limited the condemnee's evidence to the value of the property taken and consequential damages to the remainder; because the jury's valuation was within the range of the evidence, the trial court properly denied the condemnee's motion for a new trial.

       - Because there was no legislative requirement that, in a condemnation proceeding, a party seeking business loss damages had to specifically and separately plead for such in the notice of appeal, in accordance with the consent judgment that the Georgia Department of Transportation was bound by, a lessee's appeal was to proceed to trial on the lessee's claims for business loss, damages to trade fixtures, and relocation expenses.

       - In a condemnation case in which the jury awarded the property owner $86,000, because the DOT had initially paid $118,250 into the court's registry, the trial court properly entered judgment against the owner in the amount of $32,250.

       - Last word on value is the jury's verdict; the jury establishes the value. If the jury finds as a fact that the condemnor underestimated the value of the land, the condemnor must pay more; if it finds as a fact that the condemnor overestimated the value, the condemnee is not entitled to the proceeds of the government agency's mistake.

       A county shall plan, designate, improve, manage, control, construct, and maintain an adequate county road system and shall have control of and responsibility for all construction, maintenance, or other work related to the county road system. Such work may be accomplished through the use of county forces, including inmate labor, by contract as authorized in paragraph (5) of Code Section 32-4-42, or otherwise as permitted by law. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a county from entering into a contract providing for a municipality to maintain an extension of the county road system within the municipal limits;

       A county shall inspect and determine the maximum load, weight, and other vehicular dimensions which can be safely transported over each bridge on the county road system and shall post on each bridge and on each approach thereto on the county road a sign containing a legible notice showing such maximum safe limits, each such sign to conform to the department regulations promulgated under authority of Code Section 32-6-50. However, the department is authorized to give technical assistance to counties, when so requested, in carrying out this paragraph. It shall be unlawful for any person to haul, drive, or bring on any bridge any vehicle, load, or weight which in any manner exceeds the maximum limits so ascertained and posted on such bridge; and any person hauling, driving, or otherwise bringing on such bridge any load or weight exceeding the maximum limits so ascertained and posted shall do so at his own risk; and the county shall not be liable for any damages to persons or property that may result therefrom;

       A county shall keep on file in the office of the county clerk, available for public inspection, the map of the county road system prepared by the department as provided for in subsection (a) of Code Section 32-4-2. In addition to keeping on file a map of the county road system, the county shall notify the department within three months after a county road is added to the local road or street system and shall further notify the department within three months after a local road or street has been abandoned. This notification shall be accompanied by an appropriate digital file, map, or plat depicting the location of the new or abandoned road;

       When an injured party sued the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) for injuries received in a single-car accident on a county road, the party could not maintain a negligent maintenance claim against DOT because the road on which the accident occurred was not part of the state highway system, nor did the road lead to a state park; thus, under O.C.G.A.

       - In the construction of state-aid roads by the State Highway Board (now Transportation Board), it is the duty of the county authorities having control of county roads to assist in procuring the necessary rights of way.

IV) and this section to levy taxes and expend funds for the construction and maintenance of roads, it is reasonable to imply that the authority can develop facilities for the production of asphalt for use in the county road system.

        - Board of education may not use the board's funds for laying out, altering, maintaining, and improving a public, county-maintained road even though school transportation would be facilitated thereby; it is the sole duty and responsibility of the local officials in charge of county matters to lay out, alter, maintain, and improve the road in the manner the officials deem best suited to the needs of the county. 1962 Op.

      The powers of a county with respect to its county road system, unless otherwise expressly limited by law, shall include but not be limited to the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol11">
       A county shall have the authority to negotiate, let, and enter into contracts with any person or any agency, county, or municipality of the state for the construction, maintenance, administration, or operation of any public road or activities incident thereto in such manner and subject to such express limitations as may be provided by Part 2 of this article or any other provision of law. A county shall also have the authority to perform such road work with its own forces or with a combination of its own forces and the work of a contractor, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Chapter 91 of Title 36;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol12">
       A county shall have the authority to accept and use federal and state funds and to do all things necessary, proper, or expedient to achieve compliance with the provisions and requirements of all applicable federal-aid or state-aid acts and programs in connection with the county's public roads. Nothing in this title is intended to conflict with any federal law and, in case of such conflict, such portion as may be in conflict with such federal law is declared of no effect to the extent of the conflict;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol13">
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol13A">
         A county shall have the authority to acquire and dispose of real property or any interest therein for public road purposes, as provided in Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title and in Chapter 7 of this title. In any action to condemn property or interests therein for such purposes, notice thereof shall be signed by the condemning county; and such notice shall be deemed to be the official action of the county in regard to the commencement of such condemnation proceedings. For good cause shown a county, at any time after commencement of condemnation proceedings and prior to final judgment therein, may dismiss its condemnation action, provided that (i) the condemnation proceedings have not been instituted under Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title, and (ii) the condemnor has first paid to the condemnee all expenses and damages accrued to the condemnee up to the date of the filing of the motion for dismissal of the condemnation action.
        </li>
        <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol13B">
         Pursuant to the requirements of Part 2 of this article, a county shall have the power to purchase, borrow, rent, lease, control, manage, receive, and make payment for all personal property, such as equipment, machinery, vehicles, supplies, material, and furniture, which may be needed in the operation of its county road system; to lease, rent, lend, or otherwise transfer temporarily county property used for road purposes, as authorized by law; to sell or otherwise dispose of all personal property owned by the county and used in the operation of the county road system which is unserviceable; and to execute such instruments as may be necessary in connection with the exercise of the powers described in this subparagraph;
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol14">
       A county and its authorized agents and employees may enter upon any lands in the county for the purpose of making such surveys, soundings, drillings, and examinations as the county may deem necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this title; and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass nor shall it be deemed an entry which would constitute a taking in a condemnation proceeding, provided that reasonable notice of such entry shall be given the owner or occupant of such property, such entry shall be done in a reasonable manner with as little inconvenience as possible to the owner or occupant of the property, and the county shall make reimbursement for any actual damages resulting from such entry;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol15">
       A county shall have the authority to employ, discharge, promote, set and pay the salaries and compensation of its personnel, and determine the duties, qualifications, and working conditions for all persons whose services are needed in the construction, maintenance, administration, operation, and development of its county road system; to work inmates maintained in the county correctional institution or inmates hired from the Department of Corrections and maintained by the latter; and to employ or contract with such engineers, surveyors, attorneys, consultants, and all other employees as independent contractors whose services may be required, subject to the limitations of existing law;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol16">
       A county may grant permits and establish reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, renewal, removal, and relocation of pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, poles, towers, traffic and other signals, and other equipment, facilities, or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over, or under the public roads of the county which are a part of the county road system lying outside the corporate limits of a municipality. However, such regulations shall not be more restrictive with respect to utilities affected thereby than are equivalent regulations promulgated by the department with respect to utilities on the state highway system under authority of Code Section 32-6-174. As a condition precedent to the granting of such permits, the county may require application in writing specifically describing the nature, extent, and location of the portion of the utility affected and may also require the applicant to furnish an indemnity bond or other acceptable security conditioned to pay any damages to any part of the county road system or to any member of the public caused by work of the utility performed under authority of such permit. At all times it shall be the duty of the county to ensure that the normal operation of the utility does not interfere with the use of the county road system. The county may also order the removal or discontinuance of the utility, equipment, facility, or appliances where such removal and relocation are made necessary by the construction or maintenance of any part of the county road system lying outside the corporate limits of a municipality. In so ordering the removal and relocation of a utility or in performing such work itself, the county shall conform to the procedure set forth for the department in Code Sections 32-6-171 and 32-6-173, except that when the removal and relocation have been performed by the county, it shall certify the expenses thereof for collection to its county attorney;

      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol17">
       A county shall have the power to purchase supplies for county road system purposes through the state as authorized by Code Sections 50-5-100 through 50-5-102;

       In addition to any taxes authorized by Article 4 of Chapter 5 of Title 48 to be levied and collected for the construction and maintenance of its county road system and activities incident thereto, a county is authorized to levy and collect any millage as may be necessary for such purposes;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol19">
       A county may provide for surveys, maps, specifications, and other things necessary in designating, supervising, locating, abandoning, relocating, improving, constructing, or maintaining the county road system, or any part thereof, or any activities incident thereto or necessary in doing such other work on public roads as the county may be given responsibility for or control of by law;
      </li>
      <li id="t32c04s32-4-42ol110">
       In addition to the powers specifically delegated to it in this title and except as otherwise provided by Code Section 12-6-24, a county shall have the authority to adopt and enforce rules, regulations, or ordinances; to require permits; and to perform all other acts which are necessary, proper, or incidental to the efficient operation and development of the county road system; and this title shall be liberally construed to that end. Any power vested in or duty placed on a county but not implemented by specific provisions for the exercise thereof may be executed and carried out by a county in a reasonable manner subject to such limitations as may be provided by law;

       In all counties of this state having a population of 550,000 or more according to the United States decennial census of 1970 or any future such census, the county governing authority shall be empowered by ordinance or resolution to assess against any property the cost of reopening, repairing, or cleaning up from any public way, street, road, right of way, or highway any debris, dirt, sediment, soil, trash, building materials, and other physical materials originating on such property as a result of any private construction activity carried on by any developer, contractor, subcontractor, or owner of such property. Any assessment authorized under this paragraph, the interest thereon, and the expense of collection shall be a lien against the property so assessed coequal with the lien of other taxes and shall be enforced in the same manner as are state and county ad valorem property taxes by issuance of a fi. fa. and levy and sale as set forth in Title 48, known as the "Georgia Public Revenue Code"; and

       County had authority to grant permits and establish reasonable regulations for the installation of pipes, conduits, cables, and wires on the county's public roads; thus, the county had the "necessarily implied authority" to charge companies, such as the telecommunication company, a permit fee for the company's application to use the county's public rights-of-way. Accordingly, the county had the authority to enforce the county's ordinance imposing that fee and furthermore the telecommunication company did not show that the ordinance was unconstitutional.

       - Word "bridge" in this section, which gives a right of action against a county for defective construction, means a bridge used as an instrumentality for travel along a highway and for crossing streams or ravines.

       - Term "bridge" includes all the appurtenances necessary to the bridge's proper use, and embraces the bridge's abutments and approaches; that which is necessary as an approach, to connect the bridge with the highway, is an essential part of the bridge itself. Howington v. Madison County, <cite class="ga_court">126 Ga. 699</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E. 941</cite> (1906); Berrien County v. Vickers, <cite class="ga_app_court">73 Ga.

       - Contiguous embankment necessary to make access to a bridge, so as to pass teams and wagons over the bridge, is a part of the bridge, and title to the bridge covers such an embankment; but if the embankment is not a necessary part of the bridge, but a part of the streets of the municipality, the town, and not the county, would be bound to keep the bridge in repair.

       - When in action against a county for damages from the falling of a truck through an opening where a public bridge had been, into a ravine below, the petition was not demurrable (now motion to dismiss), and the verdict for the plaintiff was not contrary to law or without evidence to support the verdict since the petition and the evidence showed that at the time of the injury at least a part of the bridge, i.e., the sills constituting a portion of its "approaches," still remained, and the rest of the bridge was being repaired. Warren County v. Battle, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 240</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 673</cite> (1934).

       </h5>
       <p>
        - For a county to be liable for injuries resulting from defective bridge repairs there must have been a failure to take a bond from a contractor when such a bond was required, and the injury complained of must have occurred within the time which would have been covered by the contractor's bond, if such a bond had been given.

       - Since a public bridge was constructed under contract with the authorities of one county across a stream dividing that county from another (the authorities of the latter refusing to participate therein), it was the duty of the county authorities causing the construction of such bridge to take bond in accordance with this section.

       - After a county let out the contract for building a bridge to the lowest bidder, but took no bond from the contractor, and the injury complained of occurred ten years after the time of building the bridge, there was no legal liability on the part of the county because of such injury.

       - Liability for defects in a county-line bridge attaches only for failure of the county to take a sufficient bond from the contractor.

However, such regulations shall not be more restrictive with respect to utilities affected thereby than are equivalent regulations promulgated by the department with respect to utilities on the state highway system under authority of Code Section 32-6-174. As a condition precedent to the granting of such permits, the municipality may require application in writing specifically describing the nature, extent, and location of the portion of the utility affected. The municipality may also require the applicant to furnish an indemnity bond or other acceptable security conditioned to pay for any damage to any part of a public road or to any member of the public caused by the work of the utility performed under authority of such permit. However, it shall be the duty of the municipality to ensure that the normal operation of the utility does not interfere with the use of any portion of the municipal street system or of a municipal extension of a county public road. The municipality may also order the removal and relocation of the utility, equipment, facilities, or appliances where such removal and relocation is made necessary by the construction and maintenance of any part of the municipal street system or municipal extension of a county public road. In so ordering the removal and relocation of a utility or in performing such work itself, the municipality shall conform to the procedure set forth for the department in Code Sections 32-6-171 and 32-6-173, except that when the removal and relocation have been performed by the municipality, it shall certify the expenses thereof for collection to its city attorney; and

       If a city ordinance can be taken and construed as meaning that the owner of any improved or vacant premises of whatever character and size, within the limits of a city, becomes instantly liable for injuries to third persons from the moment any trash, banana peeling, ice, snow, or other object falls upon the abutting sidewalk, without fault or knowledge on the part of such owner, it would manifestly be a rule so harsh and unconscionable as would render such municipal ordinance unconstitutional and void as violative of Ga. Const. 1877, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. III (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. I). Ellis v. Southern Grocery Stores, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga.

        <p>
       When abutting property owner owes no duty to third person because of a defective condition of the sidewalk against which the property abuts, unless, the defect was brought about by such owner personally, the city could not by ordinance, under guise of police regulation, impose the city's own liability upon such property owner or make the owner liable to third persons for acts other than the owner's own.

       Rule that an owner of property abutting upon a street or highway is not, because of ownership, liable for defects in the street or highway does not apply when the owner of abutting property creates a defect or nuisance in a street or highway. In this event the owner is liable, not because the owner owns the abutting property, but because the owner creates or maintains the things from which injury results. Ellis v. Southern Grocery Stores, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 254</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 324</cite> (1933).

       - If the question is whether a city has performed the city's duty in regard to keeping a street in a reasonably safe condition, or whether the city has been negligent in that regard, and in respect to failing to erect proper safeguards or to placing proper lights at a dangerous place where an injury occurs, the character of the light at that point, or the light's absence, may be shown as a circumstance bearing on the question of negligence.

       - If a defect has existed in a sidewalk for such a length of time that by reasonable diligence in the performance of their duties the defect ought to have been known by the proper authorities, notice will be presumed, and proof of actual knowledge will not be necessary in order to render the municipality liable for injuries occasioned thereby. Ellis v. Southern Grocery Stores, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 254</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 324</cite> (1933).

       Knowledge on the part of a city of a defect in one of the city's sidewalks will be presumed when the defect has continued for such a length of time that, by reasonable diligence in the performance of the city's duties, the defect's existence should have become known to the proper authorities.

        It was error to overrule the city's motion for judgment n.o.v.
       
       in the case of a bus passenger who was injured when a portion of street pavement collapsed, where a crack in the pavement which could have existed for three days prior to the collapse was not itself the defect, when three days was not a sufficient time for surface or rainwater entering the crack to have undermined the pavement, and when there was nothing to indicate that if the city had investigated the crack that the cavity which caused plaintiff's injuries would have been discovered.

         Jury questions.

        <p>
       - In an action against a municipal corporation for injuries sustained while running along a certain street in the city after dark, which street was alleged to have been in a defective and unsafe condition, questions of whether the city was negligent in failing to keep the street and walkway in question in a reasonably safe condition, whether the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in running along the street and walkway on the occasion in question, and what negligence constituted the proximate cause of the injury, are questions which should have been submitted to a jury. Harris v. City of Rome, <cite class="ga_app_court">59 Ga. App. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 337</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When an action is brought against a municipality for injuries alleged to have been brought about by the existence of an obstruction in a public street of the municipality which was not shown to have been placed there by the city, when no actual notice of the obstruction is shown, the issue of whether or not the obstruction had existed for a sufficient length of time to charge the city with negligence in failing to discover and remove the obstruction should be generally left to the jury. City of Barnesville v. Sappington, <cite class="ga_app_court">58 Ga. App. 27</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 342</cite> (1938); City of Bainbridge v. Cox, <cite class="ga_app_court">83 Ga. App. 453</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 192</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Whether a defect or hole in a city street gave a right of action to a person injured thereby is ordinarily a question for the jury, because it is a complicated question of fact, involving the depth of the hole or defect, the defect's appearance to travelers on the street, and the danger which might have been anticipated and guarded against by the city in the exercise of reasonable forethought. Mayor of Buford v. Medley, <cite class="ga_app_court">58 Ga. App. 48</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 494</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When it appears that a city has permitted an excavation in a street, it becomes a question for the jury to determine as to the extent and character of the warnings or signals placed which are necessary and sufficient to give notice to members of the public using such street of the presence of such excavation or obstruction. City of Rome v. Alexander, <cite class="ga_app_court">63 Ga. App. 301</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 52</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While it is true that a city would not be liable for the existence of a latent defect not discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care, whether the defect was such as the municipality should have discovered the defect in the exercise of ordinary care in keeping the streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition is a question for the jury. City of Bainbridge v. Cox, <cite class="ga_app_court">83 Ga. App. 453</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 192</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a wrongful death case, the trial court properly denied a city summary judgment on the plaintiffs' negligence and nuisance claims based on the obstruction in the line of sight caused by a tree as a jury had to determine whether the tree located on the city's right of way obstructed the view of oncoming traffic such that the tree was a defect within the meaning of O.C.G.A.

       It is constitutionally permissible for the state to enact a statute providing that any person who operates an overweight motor vehicle on the public roads shall be conclusively presumed to have damaged the roads, and requiring such person to recompense the state for such damage in accordance with a schedule pegging the amount of the damages to the poundage of excess weight. DOT v. Del-Cook Timber Co., <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 734</cite>, <cite class="app_court">285 S.E.2d 913</cite> (1982).

        <p>

        No opportunity to prove damages.
       
       There is certainly no constitutional requirement that the person accused of operating an overweight vehicle be given an opportunity to avoid the penalty or fine by proving that no perceptible damage to the roads in fact occurred in the driver's case.

       - When the charge in question does in fact state that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has "general responsibility to design, manage and improve the state highway system," it seems to capture the essence of the sections the defendant relies upon, which are in fact very broad, general descriptions of the duties of the DOT. The additional material used by the court is drawn from the more specific statutory description of the respective duties of the DOT and municipalities. Thus, O.C.G.A.

       Trial court erred by denying the railroad's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claims based on inadequate signage at the railroad crossing and the decision to reopen the roadway because it was the Georgia Department of Transportation's responsibility to designate the location for, and the manner of placement of, the traffic control devices and signage.

        <p>
       - Town was entitled to summary judgment in a survivor's action claiming damages from the survivor's decedent's fatal collision with a train because the allegedly vision-obstructing vegetation was located on the railroad's property, and, further, it was undisputed that the survivor failed to show that the vegetation was planted or maintained in violation of any statute, code, or local ordinance. Furthermore, although railroads could be liable under common law negligence principles, the failure to maintain a railroad right of way was addressed by the Georgia Code of Public Transportation, specifically by O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       Genuine issue of material fact existed about whether there was an absence of governmental authorization for vegetation that allegedly obscured the decedent's view as the decedent drove a tractor-trailer across the town's railroad crossing and was struck by the railway's train and that issue precluded the appellate court's ruling that reversed the trial court's summary judgment to the town and the railway. Fortner v. Town of Register, <cite class="ga_court">278 Ga. 625</cite>, <cite class="app_court">604 S.E.2d 175</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Town was not entitled to summary judgment on a decedent's nuisance claim as correspondence between the town and the railway indicated that in the months preceding a train-truck accident, the defendants were aware that the overgrown shrubbery needed to be cut back to prevent interference with the line of sight at a railroad crossing; further, photographs were also submitted from which a jury might conclude that the shrubs obscured visibility.

       Applications for permits authorized by subsections (a) through (d) of Code Section 32-6-79 shall be made to the department upon forms prescribed by the department. The applications shall contain the signature of the applicant and such other information as may be required by the department and shall be verified under oath by the person, firm, or corporation making the application. Permits and renewals thereof shall be issued for and shall be valid only if the sign is erected and maintained in accordance with this part during the 12 month period next following the date of issuance. As to permits for the initial erection of an outdoor advertising sign, one 12 month extension may be granted so long as a written request is submitted to the department at least 30 days prior to expiration along with a fee of $35.00. Any denial of an extension request shall be sent to the applicant before the expiration date and shall state the basis for denial. Multiple extensions shall not be granted as to the same permit, and the applicant shall not be allowed to reapply for the same site until the extension has expired; however, modifications to the application which do not extend the term of the permit shall be allowed. There shall be an initial outdoor advertising permit fee and an annual renewal fee. On and after July 1, 2011, the outdoor advertising application fee shall be $300.00, and the renewal fee for each sign shall be $85.00. The department may adjust future application and renewal fees through the formal rule making process so long as notice of any proposed increase is sent to the House and Senate Transportation Committees at least 30 days prior to final adoption by the department. Such fees shall be limited to amounts sufficient to offset the administrative costs to the department. An annual report on the expenditures and revenues of the department related to the outdoor advertising program shall be sent to the House and Senate Transportation Committees no later than October 31 of each year. Upon receipt of a properly executed application and the appropriate fee for the erection or maintenance of a sign which may be lawfully erected or maintained pursuant to this part, the department shall, within 60 days, issue a permit authorizing the erection or maintenance, or both, of the sign for which application was made except when a person, firm, or corporation is maintaining or allowing the maintenance of an illegal sign as provided for in subsection (f) of Code Section 32-6-79. All outdoor advertising permits and renewals shall expire on the first day of April in the year following issuance. Renewal of such permits shall be made to the department between January 1 and April 1 of each calendar year. Notice of such renewal period shall be mailed to each outdoor advertising permit holder along with an itemized list of all permits maintained by such person or entity in the month of December. In response, each permit holder should clearly indicate any permits not being renewed and return a copy to the department along with payment for all permits being renewed. If a permit holder believes the itemized list is incomplete or inaccurate, such permit holder shall clearly note such discrepancies on the list and return a copy to the department with supporting documentation. The permit holder shall submit the renewal and any suggested corrections within 60 days of the date of the department notice or by April 1, whichever occurs last. If the department fails to receive the renewal before the expiration date, the department shall notify the permit holder by certified mail that the renewal is overdue and shall give the permit holder 45 days from the date of the postmark on such notice to send the department the renewal. If the applicant does not send the permit renewal and fee within 45 days after the postmark date on such notice, the permit shall expire and the sign shall then become an illegal sign. Signs shall become illegal by operation of law after the expiration of the permit followed by notice to the permit holder and a failure to submit for the renewal within 45 days. Any illegal sign may be removed without any administrative proceeding before the department. Vegetation permits or renewals issued pursuant to Code Section 32-6-75.3 shall expire on the first day of September in the year following issuance. If a vegetation permit renewal application and fee is not timely submitted and such deficiency is not cured within 45 days of the postmark date of notice via certified mail from the department, the vegetation permit shall be canceled, but the sign shall not be deemed illegal. No permit shall be renewed if the renewal thereof has not been made in accordance with this Code section.

       Permits shall be transferable. An application to have the permit specified in subsection (a) of this Code section transferred shall be made within 30 days of the change in ownership of the sign; shall be made to the department upon forms prescribed by the department; shall contain the signature of the applicant and such other information as may be required by the department; and shall be verified under oath by the person, firm, or corporation making application for transfer. Failure to comply in a timely and proper manner with this subsection shall be grounds for revocation of the permit.

         Superior court failed to address basis for conclusions of the Georgia Department of Transportation.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Judgment reversing a decision of the Georgia Department of Transportation overruling an administrative law judge's finding that one owner had a valid multiple message permit for its sign and that a second owner's application for a permit was properly denied was remanded because the superior court ignored the basis for the GDOT's conclusion and reviewed the ALJ's decision instead, and the findings and conclusions of the Deputy Commissioner of the GDOT pertaining to governmental restrictions on commercial speech did not properly address and resolve the issues; in its final agency decision, the Deputy Commissioner essentially sidestepped the issues the ALJ addressed and resolved and did not directly address the issue of whether, applying the applicable provisions and regulations, the first owner failed to make the necessary revisions to its sign, and the GDOT's conclusion that allowing the first owner to keep its permit would be unduly restrictive was arbitrary and capricious.

        - When advertising signs are removed from state highway property, the Department of Transportation must first send a 30 day notice to the owner of the signs, and then store the signs for a reasonable length of time, during which time the owner may claim the signs; if the signs are unclaimed after a reasonable length of time such signs may be treated as abandoned property and disposed of in any manner, within the law, the department deems appropriate. 1971 Op.

       - While the law authorizes the cooperation of counties and municipal corporations with the Department of Transportation for the purpose of establishing limited access highways, there is nothing in the statute or in the law generally which expressly or by implication makes one of the cooperating governmental entities liable for the unilateral tortious acts of another cooperating governmental entity in a project of this type.

       Courts may, and the Court of Appeals does, take judicial cognizance that municipalities and counties are separately created and possess divergent powers; accordingly, the unilateral action of one may not be construed as imposing liability upon the other even though the action taken by the one may be under a statute authorizing a cooperative effort.

      The department, a county, or a municipality may acquire private property and property rights for limited-access facilities and service roads, including rights of access, of view, of air, and of light through gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation in the same manner as such governmental units are authorized by law to acquire such property or property rights in connection with public roads within their respective jurisdictions. Public property or an interest therein may be acquired for such purposes by the department or by a county or municipality by any method authorized by law for such acquisition other than condemnation. The acquisition of public property or an interest therein for such purposes by condemnation may be accomplished by the department pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of Code Section 32-3-4 when such acquisition is approved by the State Commission on the Condemnation of Public Property as provided in Code Section 50-16-183. As used in this Code section, the term "public property" has the meaning provided for in Code Section 50-16-180. In the process of acquiring property or property rights for any limited-access facility, the department or the county or municipality, in its discretion, may acquire an entire lot, block, or tract of land if, by so doing, the interest of the public will best be served.

The designating authority may recommend to the commissioner of public safety or, if the roads in question are in a municipality, to the municipality that there be fixed on such roads and on the separate lanes thereof such rates of speed as are deemed in the public interest. No person shall have any right of ingress to or egress from or passage across any limited-access road to or from abutting lands except at the designated points to which access may be permitted and under such arrangements and conditions as may be specified from time to time.

Any such agreement between a county or municipality and a railroad shall be submitted to the department for its approval; and work leading to the elimination of the grade crossing pursuant to the agreement shall not commence until and unless the department approves the same.

It shall be the duty of said railroad to begin work on any such grade separation structure within four months after receipt of an order to that effect and to complete that structure within a reasonable time, provided that the railroad shall not be required to do the actual physical work of providing approaches by fill to an overpass or the excavating beneath an underpass or the approaches thereto, although the cost of such work shall be considered as part of the costs of the grade crossing elimination, whether actually performed by the railroad, the department, the county, or the municipality; and such costs shall be apportioned as provided in Code Section 32-6-195. If the railroad does not begin work within four months after receipt of an order to that effect, the department, county, or municipality may proceed with the construction of the proposed grade separation structure.

In the event that the railroad does not make payment or arrange to make payment to the department, county, or municipality within 60 days of receipt of the statement, the department shall certify the amount for collection to the Attorney General; or, in the case of a project on a county or municipal public road system, the county or municipality shall take appropriate action for the collection of the amount thereof.

       Trial court erred by denying the railroad's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claims based on inadequate signage at the railroad crossing and the decision to reopen the roadway because it was the Georgia Department of Transportation's responsibility to designate the location for, and the manner of placement of, the traffic control devices and signage.

        - In a wrongful death action, the district court did not err by instructing the jury concerning the railroad's duty to maintain traffic control devices because taking all of the instructions together, the jury was properly informed that the railroad could not be held liable for the decision about which warning device to put in place or continue in place, but the railroad could be held liable for any failure to repair an existing warning light.

      Any junkyard lawfully in existence on April 6, 1967, which is within 1,000 feet of the nearest edge of the right of way and visible from the main traveled way of any public road on the interstate or primary system, shall, whenever feasible, be screened by the department if such road is on the state highway system, otherwise by the county or municipal government having jurisdiction, so as not to be visible from such public road. Such junkyards may be screened at locations either on the right of way of such public road or on property acquired by the department for that purpose outside such right of way. Whenever the commissioner determines that it is in the best interest of the state, the department may acquire, pursuant to any of the procedures for property acquisition set forth in Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title, such property or interests therein outside existing public road rights of way as may be necessary to provide adequate screening of such junkyards.

       When the county sought to abandon two roads, notice by publication was insufficient to meet the requirement of notice to adjoining property owners; thus, the showing of such notice by the owners who claimed title to the roads did not entitle them to summary judgment.

      Whenever any property has been acquired in any manner by the department, a county, or a municipality for public road purposes and thereafter the department, county, or municipality determines that all or any part of the property or any interest therein is no longer needed for such purposes because of changed conditions, the department or the county or municipality is authorized to dispose of such property or such interest therein in accordance with Code Section 32-7-4. Any disposition of property acquired for utility relocation, as provided for in Code Section 32-6-172, or on which utilities are located shall not be subject to Code Section 32-7-4; and no provision of this title shall be construed to prevent the department from conveying to the federal government land or interests in land acquired for federal parkways in Georgia, as provided in Article 2 of Chapter 3 of this title.

       - If a county or municipality acquires land for public road purposes, rezones the land in a manner increasing the land's value, and then decides to sell the property, the county or municipality has decided that the property was no longer needed for public road purposes at the time of the rezoning and, thus, the property must be offered to the original owner based on the land's value under the land's pre-rezoning classification.

       In order that any interest in real property acquired for public road or other transportation purposes may be used most economically, the department, counties, or municipalities, in addition to the authority granted in Code Section 32-7-3 to dispose of property no longer needed and in subsection (b) of Code Section 32-3-3 to exchange property, may, notwithstanding Article 2 of Chapter 16 of Title 50, the "State Properties Code," improve, use, maintain, or lease any interest in property acquired for public road or other transportation purposes that is not presently needed for such purposes.

       If the department, a county, or municipality decides to lease any such property or interest therein, the owner of such property at the time of its acquisition or his successor in interest shall have the right to lease such property at an appraised fair market value to be determined by the department, county, or municipality for such period of time until the property is needed for public road or other transportation purposes. However, if at the time of acquisition such property was leased to a tenant, the tenant, instead of the owner or his successor in interest, shall have the first right to lease such property at the appraised fair market value. If the owner, his successor in interest, or the tenant of the property does not lease such property, the department, county, or municipality shall have the right to lease such property at a price equal to the highest sealed public bid, if the bid is acceptable to the department, county, or municipality, for such period of time until the property is needed for public road or other transportation purposes. If no bids or bids which are insufficient are received, the department, county, or municipality may readvertise for new public bids. The department, county, or municipality may negotiate a lease with any state or federal agency, county, or municipality without the aforesaid requirement of sealed bids or leasing to the former owner. The department, county, or municipality shall have the right to impose reasonable restrictions, terms, or conditions on the use of such leased property.

If the department decides to lease any such property, the property shall be leased, at an appraised fair market value to be determined by the department, to the owner or the lessee of the property adjacent to the department's rights of way for the purposes of parking. Such property shall only be used for the purposes of providing parking and shall not be subleased without the department's prior approval. Plans for the use of said property must be submitted to and approved by the department prior to any construction. Regardless of any financial expenditures by the lessee, no lease granted under this subsection shall merge into and become a property interest of the lessee or a sublessee. The department shall reserve the right to terminate any lease without cause upon 30 days' written notice to the lessee. Notwithstanding any provisions of Code Section 48-2-17, all net revenues derived from the lease of any of the department's property used for the purposes of providing parking shall be utilized by the department to offset the cost of maintaining the public roads of the state.

       "(5)
   The Department of Transportation is requested specifically to identify 20 major areas with a history of traffic congestion in and around our state that will derive the most benefit from the use of FlexAuto lanes and, after identifying these areas, to create and rapidly implement a plan for use of such lanes in such areas;

The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest as provided for in Code Section 32-10-31, shall be payable in such manner of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority from the special funds provided in this article for such payment, shall mature not later than 30 years from the date of issuance, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds. For the purpose of this Code section, bonds shall not be considered to be outstanding if there shall have been deposited into the sinking fund created for the payment of such bonds amounts sufficient to pay the same, together with the interest thereon as the bonds mature.

Also, any holder of bonds or interest coupons issued under this article, any receiver for such holders, or any indentured trustee may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this article or by resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, rents, and other charges for the use of the project or projects; and, in the event of default of the authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any bond issue, the individual, receiver, or trustee specified in this Code section shall be subrogated to each and every right, specifically including the contract rights of collecting rentals, which the authority may possess against the board and the department or either of them or their respective successors; and, in the pursuit of their remedies as subrogee, such individual, receiver, or trustee may proceed, either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceedings due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged directly or indirectly to the benefit of the bond issue of which said individual, receiver, or trustee is representative. No holder of any such bond or receiver or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state; nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state. However, any provision of this article or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, any such bondholder or receiver or indenture trustee shall have the right by appropriate legal or equitable proceedings, including without being limited to mandamus, to enforce compliance by the appropriate public officials with Article VII, Section IV and Article III, Section IX, Paragraph VI(b) of the Constitution of Georgia; and permission is given for the institution of any such proceedings to compel the payment of lease obligations.

         No motor vehicle shall be driven or towed through a toll collection facility, where appropriate signs have been erected to notify traffic that it is subject to the payment of tolls beyond such sign, without payment of the proper toll. In the event of nonpayment of the proper toll, as evidenced by video or electronic recording, the registered owner of such vehicle shall be liable to make prompt payment to the authority of the proper toll and an administrative fee of up to $25.00 per violation to recover the cost of collecting the toll. The authority or its authorized agent shall provide notice to the registered owner of a vehicle, and a reasonable time to respond to such notice, of the authority's finding of a violation of this subsection. The authority or its authorized agent may provide subsequent notices to the registered owner of a vehicle if such owner fails to respond to the initial notice.

If the authority finds multiple failures by a registered owner of a vehicle to pay the proper toll and administrative fee after notice thereof and within the time designated in such notices, the authority may refer the matter to the Office of State Administrative Hearings. The scope of any hearing held by the Office of State Administrative Hearings shall be limited to consideration of evidence relevant to a determination of whether the registered owner has failed to pay, after notice thereof and within the time designated in such notice, the proper toll and administrative fee. The only affirmative defense that may be presented by the registered owner of a vehicle at such a hearing is theft of the vehicle, as evidenced by presentation at the hearing of a copy of a police report showing that the vehicle has been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation. A determination by the Office of State Administrative Hearings of multiple failures to pay by a registered owner of a vehicle shall subject such registered owner to imposition of, in addition to any unpaid tolls and administrative fees, a civil monetary penalty payable to the authority of not more than $70.00 per violation. Upon failure by a registered owner to pay to the authority, within 30 days of the date of notice thereof, the amount determined by the Office of State Administrative Hearings as due and payable for multiple violations of this subsection, the motor vehicle registration of such registered owner shall be immediately suspended by operation of law.

Such suspension shall continue until the proper toll, administrative fee, and civil monetary penalty as have been determined by the Office of State Administrative Hearings are paid to the authority.

       In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company, inside or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority.

       Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholder, including the right of the appointment of a receiver upon default in the payment of any principal or interest obligation and the right of any receiver or indenture trustee to enforce collection of tolls, revenues, or other charges for the use of the project or projects, necessary to pay all costs of operation, all reserves provided for, the principal and interest on all bonds in the given issue, all cost of collection, and all other costs reasonably necessary to accomplish the collection of such sums, in the event of any default by the authority.

      <li id="t32c10s32-10-100ol1c">
       Such resolution or trust indenture may include covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; and the operation and maintenance of the project or projects; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision of department engineers or others satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued for such project or projects. Such resolution or trust indenture may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c10s32-10-100ol1d">
       It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations.

      <li id="t32c10s32-10-100ol1e">
       In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.
