      The enactment of this Code is intended as a recodification, revision, modernization, and reenactment of the general laws of the State of Georgia which are currently of force and is intended, where possible, to resolve conflicts which exist in the law and to repeal those laws which are obsolete as a result of the passage of time or other causes, which have been declared unconstitutional or invalid, or which have been superseded by the enactment of later laws. Except as otherwise specifically provided by particular provisions of this Code, the enactment of this Code by the General Assembly is not intended to alter the substantive law in existence on the effective date of this Code.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.51.html#t51c07s51-7-60" target="_blank">51-7-60</a></cite>, governing detention of persons suspected of shoplifting, be read in the conjunctive, notwithstanding the use of the disjunctive in the present Code section because the Code revision committee's substitution of the word "or" for "or provided" between the paragraphs tends to give the statute a potentially irrational effect.

       - Although the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) specifically repealed the Code of 1933, the Rules of the Superior Court were not a part of that repealed code even though they "conveniently" appeared therein. The three-minute rule is one of long standing, originally promulgated pursuant to authority given by law and never specifically repealed by the General Assembly.

        <p>
       - Just as is the rule in construing statutes, where a section is plain, unambiguous, and positive, and is not capable of two constructions, the court is not authorized to construe it according to what is supposed to be the intention of the General Assembly. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Wise, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 254</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 63</cite> (1940).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While it is true that the adoption by the General Assembly of the Code of 1933 amounted to a reenactment of each section thereof as contemporary statutes, it is also true that in construing the meaning of an ambiguous section, the original Act will be looked to in order to determine the true interpretation of the section; and in such an interpretation of an ambiguous section having the force of a statute, unless the contrary manifestly appears from the words employed, the language of such section should be construed as intending to state the previously existing law, and not to change it. State v. Camp, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 209</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E.2d 299</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Unless contrary manifestly appears from words employed, section should be understood as stating existing law, and not changing it. Maddox v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 106</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 662</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where, by the language of the section itself, its context, and by reason of the expressed subject matter under which it is grouped, it becomes proper and necessary to determine the true intent of the legislative body, it will be construed in the light of the source from which it came, to the extent that the language of the section itself may be compatible with such a construction; in such a case, where the section has been codified from a decision of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, the section will be construed, insofar as is compatible with its terms, so as to conform to the then existing law, rather than to change the rule in force at the time the Code was adopted. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Wise, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 254</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 63</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where an intention to change appears, it must be given effect,
       
       not because of any power of legislation vested in the codifiers or the commission, but because of the adopting statute. Maddox v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 106</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 662</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Proposed change must be conspicuous
       
       so as to demand inference that it was noticed by the lawmaking body before the presumption against a change may be overthrown. Maddox v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 106</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 662</cite> (1940).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The adoption of the Code of 1933 amounted to a reenactment of each section as contemporary statutes of the state, and each section should be dealt with as though it were contained in the same Act of the General Assembly and should be construed as if it was a separate paragraph of the same statute. Therefore, sections relating to the same subject matter and codified at the same time should be construed, if possible, to harmonize with each other, and that construction should be adopted which will prevent a contradiction by one section of the other, so that both will be operative. Grand Trunk W.R.R. v. Barge, <cite class="ga_app_court">75 Ga. App. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 281</cite> (1947).

       - Where two sections of the Code are found to be in irreconcilable conflict, and both sections are derived from Acts of the General Assembly, this conflict must be settled by resort to the original Acts from which the conflicting sections are derived, and that section which is derived from the later Act of the General Assembly must control.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - One who is a citizen does not necessarily have the right to exercise all the rights exercised by any citizen. It is within the power of the state, by proper methods, to deny to any citizen any right. But that denial must be made by the proper authority. White v. Clements, <cite class="ga_court">39 Ga. 232</cite> (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Naturalized citizen stands upon the same footing as other citizens,
       
       and the naturalized citizen has all the rights anybody has - unless it is otherwise specially provided by law. White v. Clements, <cite class="ga_court">39 Ga. 232</cite> (1869).

       - Though a victim of sexual assault was mentally and physically disabled, a trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in determining that the victim was competent to testify against the defendant at the defendant's criminal trial because the trial court held a competency hearing and found that the victim understood the victim's responsibility to tell the truth and clearly knew what had happened, who had done it, and so communicated those facts, despite the victim's mental and physical disabilities.

       <p>
        <p>
       - A party primary held under the provisions of former Code 1933,
   §
   34-3212, merely chooses candidates or nominees of a political party to be submitted to the entire electorate in the general election, and is not an "election" within the meaning of that term as used in the statutory and constitutional provisions of Georgia conferring upon its citizens the right to vote in an election; the right to participate in such a primary does not come within the protection of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. Cox v. Peters, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1951), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">342 U.S. 936</cite>, <cite class="s_court">72 S.

       Right of citizen to hold office is general rule, ineligibility the exception;

       - In a suit challenging a court's electronic filing fee system, the trial court did not err when the court granted the motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XII and O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t01c02s1-2-6ol1a6" target="_self">1-2-6(a)(6)</a></cite> because Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para.

       - The privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution prohibits Georgia courts from applying the doctrine of forum non conveniens to citizens of other states who are nonresidents of Georgia in federal tort cases and declining to exercise jurisdiction of such suits brought by them. Brown v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., <cite class="ga_court">229 Ga. 481</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E.2d 382</cite> (1972).

       - If a wife was an alien enemy, and as such could not be a beneficiary under a will, then the nomination of her as a beneficiary would have amounted to no more than the creation of a void legacy. In such a case, the effect of the invalidity of the legacy is to render the legacy void, but not to invalidate the entire will, and it is no ground of caveat to the probate of a will that a devise to a particular person may be void.

       <p>

       Statute is presumed to be valid and constitutional until the contrary appears,
      
      and, where challenged as a whole, the attack will necessarily fail unless the statute is invalid in every part for some reason alleged. Williams v. Ragsdale, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 274</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 339</cite> (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A solemn Act of the General Assembly is presumed to be constitutional. State v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">272 S.E.2d 721</cite> (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A statute properly enacted is presumed to be constitutional. Development Auth. v. Beverly Enters., <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 64</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 324</cite> (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       An Act of the General Assembly carries a strong presumption of constitutionality, and therefore should not be set aside unless it "plainly and palpably" conflicts with a constitutional provision. City of Atlanta v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 636 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Statute must be construed with reference to whole system
      
      of which it is a part. Allison v. Domain, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 542</cite>, <cite class="app_court">281 S.E.2d 299</cite> (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Construction which will give effect to a statute or rule is preferred
      
      to a construction which will destroy it. Brown v. State Merit Sys. of Personnel Admin., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 239</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 186</cite> (1980).
      </p>

        <p>
       - It is contrary to the generally accepted principles for construing statutes to "read out" any part of the statute as "mere surplusage" unless there is a clear reason for doing so. Porter v.

        <p>
       - In construing an ordinance or resolution of a governmental unit, if the language is susceptible of more than one construction, that construction is preferred which will render it valid rather than invalid. Mayor of Hapeville v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 786</cite>, <cite class="app_court">272 S.E.2d 713</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It is courts' duty
       
       to put construction upon statutes, if possible, and to uphold them and carry them into effect. Lamons v. Yarbrough, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1949).
       </p>

        <p>
       It is the duty of the court in construing an ambiguous statute to give it a construction, if the language permits, that will sustain the Act, rather than a construction that will render it invalid.

       All statutes are presumed to be enacted by the General Assembly with full knowledge of the existing condition of the law and with reference to it; new statutes are to be construed in connection and in harmony with the existing law, and their meaning and effect will be determined in connection with not only the common law and the Constitution, but also with reference to other statutes and the decisions of the courts. State v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">272 S.E.2d 721</cite> (1980); Allison v. Domain, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga.

       - If a statute is plain and susceptible of but one construction, the courts have no authority to place a different construction on it, but must apply it according to its terms. Thompson v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">73 Ga. App. 587</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1946).

        <p>
       Courts of last resort must frequently construe the language of a statute, but they may not substitute by judicial interpretation language of their own for the clear, unambiguous language of the statute, so as to change the meaning. Frazier v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 590</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 774</cite> (1946).

City of Roswell v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">261 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">410 S.E.2d 28</cite> (1991).

        <p>
       - Just as is the rule in construing statutes, where a section is plain, unambiguous, and positive, and is not capable of two constructions, the court is not authorized to construe it according to what is supposed to be the intention of the General Assembly.

       Statutes are not contracts, and it is intent of the General Assembly and not of any other "party" which is decisive in their construction. City of Fitzgerald v. Newcomer, <cite class="ga_app_court">162 Ga. App. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">291 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1982).

       While all parts of a statute should be preserved, yet a cardinal rule of construction is that the legislative intent shall be effectuated, even though some verbiage may have to be eliminated.

       - An exception to the general rule that the use of plain and unequivocal language in a legislative enactment obviates any necessity for judicial construction is presented by the use of words the meaning of which in general acceptation is apparently obvious, and yet the purpose of the General Assembly would be defeated were the words employed construed literally.

       Where to construe an Act of the General Assembly in a particular way would, while hewing to its literal terms, result in defeating the obvious legislative purposes and intent, such construction will not be given where an obvious typographical or clerical error can be corrected so as to carry out the intent.

        <p>
       - Even though the literal language of an Act may be plain and unequivocal, it is the duty of the courts, in determining the legislative intent, to refrain from ascribing to the General Assembly a wholly unreasonable intention or an intention to do a futile and useless thing. City of Jesup v. Bennett, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 606</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E.2d 81</cite> (1970).

       It is the duty of the court to consider the results and consequences of any proposed construction and not so construe a statute that will result in unreasonable or absurd consequences not contemplated by the General Assembly. GECC v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 109</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 596</cite> (1978).

       - To give effect to the intention of the General Assembly, courts are not controlled by the literal meaning of the language of the statute, but the spirit or intention of the law prevails over the letter thereof. Where the letter of the statute results in absurdity or injustice or would lead to contradictions, the meaning of general language may be restrained by the spirit or reason of the statute. Sirmans v.

       - It is the duty of the court to arrive at the legislative intent, and, in doing so, it should not adopt an arbitrary rule that the General Assembly intended to make a typographical or clerical error, the result of which would be to make nonsense of the Act and not carry out the legislative scheme, but to destroy it. Lamons v. Yarbrough, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1949).
       </p>
       <p>

       The construction of a statute which will give effect to legislative intent and preserve the Act is preferred to a construction which will necessarily destroy it. Webb v. Echols, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 724</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E.2d 625</cite> (1955).

        <p>
       - In case of a mistake in a reference in a statute to another statute, where the real intent of the General Assembly is manifest and would be defeated by an adherence to the terms of the mistaken reference, and the Act is otherwise a complete Act within itself, the mistaken reference will be regarded as surplusage, or will be read and corrected, in order to give effect to the legislative intent.

       <p>
        <p>
       - One of the traditional functions of courts is to interpret and construe legislative enactments. There is no due process prohibition on the enactment of legislation which requires definitions to be provided by the judiciary. Bell v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_court">241 Ga. 103</cite>, <cite class="app_court">243 S.E.2d 40</cite> (1978).
       </p>

        Statute's words, if of common use, are taken in natural and ordinary signification.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       By the mandate of this section, the courts are required to give a word its ordinary signification. Thompson v. Eastern Air Lines, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 216</cite>, <cite class="app_court">39 S.E.2d 225</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intention of the General Assembly is to be gathered from the statute as a whole so as to give effect to each of its parts and at the same time harmonize, if possible, the component parts, and in determining this intention, the words of the statute are to be given their ordinary and usual signification. In re Ga. Air, Inc., 345 F. Supp. 636 (N.D. Ga. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although a statute does not undertake to define each of the words contained therein, this will not automatically render the statute vague, indefinite, or uncertain in meaning, since the ordinary signification shall be applied to all words, except words of art or words connected with a particular trade or subject matter. Anderson v. Little &amp; Davenport Funeral Home, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 751</cite>, <cite class="app_court">251 S.E.2d 250</cite> (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Every word employed should be expounded in its plain, obvious, and commonsense meaning
       
       unless something else furnishes ground to control, qualify, or enlarge it. Wellborn v. Estes, <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 390</cite> (1883) see also Booth v. Saffold, <cite class="ga_court">46 Ga. 278</cite> (1872); Mott v. Central R.R., <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 680</cite>, 48 Am. R. 595 (1883); Richmond &amp; D.R.R. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Absent words of limitation, statutory words should be given ordinary and everyday meaning.
       
       Risser v. City of Thomasville, <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 866</cite>, <cite class="app_court">286 S.E.2d 727</cite> (1982).

        <p>

        In construing statutes, their ordinary signification shall be applied to all words,
       
       except in certain defined cases. The same rule of construction is applicable to constitutional provisions. Jones v. Darby, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 71</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 835</cite> (1931).

       - The words "Nominations from the floor shall always be in order," in a by-law are to be given their ordinary signification, and the plain and obvious meaning of the language employed is that nominations from the floor are always in order until an election has in fact been held.

       - Where a statute directs the doing of a thing in a certain time, without any negative words restraining the doing of it afterwards, generally the provision as to time is directory and not a limitation of authority; and in such case, where no injury appears to have resulted, the fact that the Act was performed after the time limit will not render it invalid.

       Generally, statutes directing the mode of proceeding by public officers, designated to promote method, system uniformity, and dispatch in such proceedings, will be regarded as directory if a disregard thereof will not injure the rights of parties, and the statute does not declare what result shall follow noncompliance therewith, nor contain negative words importing a prohibition of any other mode of proceeding than that prescribed. Collins v. Nix, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 520</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E.2d 235</cite> (1972); State v. Battise, <cite class="ga_app_court">177 Ga.

      <p>
       <p>

       Statute is presumed to be valid and constitutional until the contrary appears,
      
      and, where challenged as a whole, the attack will necessarily fail unless the statute is invalid in every part for some reason alleged. Williams v. Ragsdale, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 274</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 339</cite> (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A solemn Act of the General Assembly is presumed to be constitutional. State v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">272 S.E.2d 721</cite> (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A statute properly enacted is presumed to be constitutional. Development Auth. v. Beverly Enters., <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 64</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 324</cite> (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       An Act of the General Assembly carries a strong presumption of constitutionality, and therefore should not be set aside unless it "plainly and palpably" conflicts with a constitutional provision. City of Atlanta v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 636 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Statute must be construed with reference to whole system
      
      of which it is a part. Allison v. Domain, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 542</cite>, <cite class="app_court">281 S.E.2d 299</cite> (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Construction which will give effect to a statute or rule is preferred
      
      to a construction which will destroy it. Brown v. State Merit Sys. of Personnel Admin., <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 239</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 186</cite> (1980).
      </p>

        <p>
       - It is contrary to the generally accepted principles for construing statutes to "read out" any part of the statute as "mere surplusage" unless there is a clear reason for doing so. Porter v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In construing an ordinance or resolution of a governmental unit, if the language is susceptible of more than one construction, that construction is preferred which will render it valid rather than invalid. Mayor of Hapeville v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 786</cite>, <cite class="app_court">272 S.E.2d 713</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It is courts' duty
       
       to put construction upon statutes, if possible, and to uphold them and carry them into effect. Lamons v. Yarbrough, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1949).
       </p>

       It is the duty of the court in construing an ambiguous statute to give it a construction, if the language permits, that will sustain the Act, rather than a construction that will render it invalid.

        <p>
       - If a statute is plain and susceptible of but one construction, the courts have no authority to place a different construction on it, but must apply it according to its terms. Thompson v.

       Courts of last resort must frequently construe the language of a statute, but they may not substitute by judicial interpretation language of their own for the clear, unambiguous language of the statute, so as to change the meaning. Frazier v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 590</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 774</cite> (1946).

      The cardinal rule to guide the construction of law is, first, to ascertain the legislative intent and purpose in enacting the law, and then to give it that construction which will effectuate the legislative intent and purpose. City of Jesup v. Bennett, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 606</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E.2d 81</cite> (1970); Hollowell v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Just as is the rule in construing statutes, where a section is plain, unambiguous, and positive, and is not capable of two constructions, the court is not authorized to construe it according to what is supposed to be the intention of the General Assembly. Atlanta &amp; W.P.R.R. v. Wise, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 254</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 63</cite> (1940).

       Statutes are not contracts, and it is intent of the General Assembly and not of any other "party" which is decisive in their construction. City of Fitzgerald v. Newcomer, <cite class="ga_app_court">162 Ga. App. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">291 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1982).

       While all parts of a statute should be preserved, yet a cardinal rule of construction is that the legislative intent shall be effectuated, even though some verbiage may have to be eliminated.

       - An exception to the general rule that the use of plain and unequivocal language in a legislative enactment obviates any necessity for judicial construction is presented by the use of words the meaning of which in general acceptation is apparently obvious, and yet the purpose of the General Assembly would be defeated were the words employed construed literally.

       Where to construe an Act of the General Assembly in a particular way would, while hewing to its literal terms, result in defeating the obvious legislative purposes and intent, such construction will not be given where an obvious typographical or clerical error can be corrected so as to carry out the intent.

       Courts may construe the language employed in the Act in connection with the context, and ascertain the legislative intent as derived from the old law, the evil, and the remedy, and will not defeat the intention and purpose of the General Assembly by giving effect to words which would render the purpose of the General Assembly in the passage of the enactment futile, unenforceable, or ineffectual.

        <p>
       - Even though the literal language of an Act may be plain and unequivocal, it is the duty of the courts, in determining the legislative intent, to refrain from ascribing to the General Assembly a wholly unreasonable intention or an intention to do a futile and useless thing. City of Jesup v. Bennett, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 606</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E.2d 81</cite> (1970).

        <p>
       It is the duty of the court to consider the results and consequences of any proposed construction and not so construe a statute that will result in unreasonable or absurd consequences not contemplated by the General Assembly. GECC v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 109</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 596</cite> (1978).

       A court may decline to give a legislative Act such construction as will attribute to the General Assembly an intention to pass an Act which is not reasonable, or as will defeat the purpose of the proposed legislation.

       - To give effect to the intention of the General Assembly, courts are not controlled by the literal meaning of the language of the statute, but the spirit or intention of the law prevails over the letter thereof. Where the letter of the statute results in absurdity or injustice or would lead to contradictions, the meaning of general language may be restrained by the spirit or reason of the statute. Sirmans v.

       - It is the duty of the court to arrive at the legislative intent, and, in doing so, it should not adopt an arbitrary rule that the General Assembly intended to make a typographical or clerical error, the result of which would be to make nonsense of the Act and not carry out the legislative scheme, but to destroy it. Lamons v. Yarbrough, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1949).
       </p>

       The construction of a statute which will give effect to legislative intent and preserve the Act is preferred to a construction which will necessarily destroy it. Webb v. Echols, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 724</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E.2d 625</cite> (1955).

       - In case of a mistake in a reference in a statute to another statute, where the real intent of the General Assembly is manifest and would be defeated by an adherence to the terms of the mistaken reference, and the Act is otherwise a complete Act within itself, the mistaken reference will be regarded as surplusage, or will be read and corrected, in order to give effect to the legislative intent.

       - It is an elementary rule of statutory construction that a statute must be construed in relation to other statutes of which it is a part, and all statutes relating to the same subject matter, briefly called statutes "in pari materia," are construed together and harmonized wherever possible, so as to ascertain the legislative intendment and give effect thereto. Ryan v. Commissioners of Chatham County, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 86</cite> (1948).

       In the construction of a statute, all laws in pari materia should be considered in order to ascertain the intention of the General Assembly. Undercofler v. L.C.

       - Statutes in pari materia may not be resorted to where language under consideration is clear, but where the terms of the statute to be construed are ambiguous or its significance is of a doubtful character, it becomes necessary to give proper consideration to other related statutes in order to ascertain the legislative intent in reference to the whole system of laws of which the doubtful statute is a part.

       - While the Supreme Court recognizes the rule that statutes in pari materia may not be resorted to where the language of the statute under consideration is clear, it is equally as well settled that, where the terms of the statute to be construed are ambiguous or its significance is of a doubtful character, it becomes necessary to give proper consideration to other related statutes in order to ascertain the legislative intent in reference to the whole system of laws of which the doubtful statute is a part.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       By the mandate of this section, the courts are required to give a word its ordinary signification. Thompson v. Eastern Air Lines, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 216</cite>, <cite class="app_court">39 S.E.2d 225</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intention of the General Assembly is to be gathered from the statute as a whole so as to give effect to each of its parts and at the same time harmonize, if possible, the component parts, and in determining this intention, the words of the statute are to be given their ordinary and usual signification. In re Ga. Air, Inc., 345 F. Supp. 636 (N.D. Ga. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although a statute does not undertake to define each of the words contained therein, this will not automatically render the statute vague, indefinite, or uncertain in meaning, since the ordinary signification shall be applied to all words, except words of art or words connected with a particular trade or subject matter. Anderson v. Little &amp; Davenport Funeral Home, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 751</cite>, <cite class="app_court">251 S.E.2d 250</cite> (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Every word employed should be expounded in its plain, obvious, and commonsense meaning
       
       unless something else furnishes ground to control, qualify, or enlarge it. Wellborn v. Estes, <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 390</cite> (1883) see also Booth v. Saffold, <cite class="ga_court">46 Ga. 278</cite> (1872); Mott v. Central R.R., <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 680</cite>, 48 Am. R. 595 (1883); Richmond &amp; D.R.R. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Absent words of limitation, statutory words should be given ordinary and everyday meaning.

       - Where a statute directs the doing of a thing in a certain time, without any negative words restraining the doing of it afterwards, generally the provision as to time is directory and not a limitation of authority; and in such case, where no injury appears to have resulted, the fact that the Act was performed after the time limit will not render it invalid.

       Generally, statutes directing the mode of proceeding by public officers, designated to promote method, system uniformity, and dispatch in such proceedings, will be regarded as directory if a disregard thereof will not injure the rights of parties, and the statute does not declare what result shall follow noncompliance therewith, nor contain negative words importing a prohibition of any other mode of proceeding than that prescribed. Collins v. Nix, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 520</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E.2d 235</cite> (1972); State v. Battise, <cite class="ga_app_court">177 Ga.

       Paragraph (d)(3) of this section is a rule of statutory construction, and does not apply to contractual limitations; yet, this section states a rule of reason with respect to limitations, be they statutory or contractual, which should be applied to limitations in contracts in the absence of any sound reason for not applying them.

       - As a general rule it may be said that a defective summons will be regarded as aided or cured by the pleadings served with the summons when, with all the information contained in the two papers in the defendant's possession, the defendant could not be misled as to the nature of the relief demanded, or as to the court in which the proceedings are to be instituted.

        If accused can admit all accusations of indictment and still be innocent,
       
       indictment is defective. Every indictment must be complete within itself, and charge a crime and every substantial element of the offense alleged to be committed. Gore v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">79 Ga. App. 696</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 669</cite> (1949).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - To the average layman, "accident" means only what the definition given it in this section states; an unintentional act, as opposed to something done in order to achieve a particular consequence. Bush v. Skelton, <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 83</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 835</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       "Accident" means an unintentional act, as opposed to something done in order to achieve a particular consequence. Cohran v. Douglasville Concrete Prods., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 8</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 507</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       For purposes of constructing subject insurance policy, accident meant "an event which takes place without one's foresight or expectation or design." Crook v. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">207 Ga. App. 614</cite>, <cite class="app_court">428 S.E.2d 802</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        "Accident" in its strict sense implies absence of negligence for which no one is liable.
       
       Richter v. Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">65 Ga. App. 605</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 259</cite> (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The idea of "accident" excludes responsibility because of negligence. Bush v. Skelton, <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 83</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 835</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The legal connotation of "accident" has reference to unintentional acts occurring without being caused by any negligence of the parties involved. Lawrence v. Hayes, <cite class="ga_app_court">92 Ga. App. 778</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 102</cite> (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The defense of accident is to be confined to its strict sense as an occurrence which takes place in the absence of negligence and for which no one would be liable. Chadwick v. Miller, <cite class="ga_app_court">169 Ga. App. 338</cite>, <cite class="app_court">312 S.E.2d 835</cite> (1983).

       Although the definition of "accident" is somewhat ambiguous, in that it may also be said of lack of ordinary care that does not exist by reason of foresight or design, yet the distinction has been clearly stated in the cases as something which would not have been precluded by the exercise of ordinary care on the part of either the plaintiff or the defendant.

       - Word "accident" means, in personal injury cases, injury which occurs without being caused by negligence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. Cohran v. Douglasville Concrete Prods., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 8</cite>, <cite class="app_court">264 S.E.2d 507</cite> (1980); Freed v.

       An "accident," in a strict legal sense, as applied to negligence cases, refers to an event which is not proximately caused by negligence, but instead arises from an unforeseen or unexplained cause. But it is also often used to indicate a happening which, although not wholly free from negligence by some person, was not proximately caused by the failure of either of the parties to a case to exercise ordinary care in the situation. Baggett v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_app_court">79 Ga. App. 460</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 146</cite> (1949).

       The word "accident," as applied to personal injury cases, has a legal meaning as referring to an injury which occurs without being caused by the negligence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. Bush v. Skelton, <cite class="ga_app_court">91 Ga. App. 83</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 835</cite> (1954).

       In a personal injury case, an "accident" is an event which happens unmixed with the lack of ordinary care and diligence of either party, for which there can be no recovery. Trammell v. Williams, <cite class="ga_app_court">97 Ga. App. 31</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 887</cite> (1958).

       - Where the defendant was engaged in the unlawful act of willfully and wantonly firing a loaded pistol between dark and daylight on a public highway, not on the defendant's own premises or in defense of person or property, from which a homicide resulted, the defense of accidental homicide was not involved, and the trial judge did not err in refusing to give a written request to charge.

        Because the underlying civil action did not involve allegations of an "accident," and there was no "occurrence" under the terms of the insurance policy, the defendant insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify plaintiffs in the underlying action and the insurer was entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' suit.

       - Where an accident is not involved in a case, and a charge is given on "accident" without defining the term, which would tend to lead the jury to believe that the plaintiffs could not recover unless the act of the defendant was nonaccidental or intentional, then the charge is an error requiring a reversal of the case.

        An "act of God" means a casualty which is not only not due to human agency,

       The trial court improperly injected consideration of human factors into the calculus when it charged that an act of God "is not due to any human agency" and added that "acts of God are events of nature, which are so extraordinary in character that human scale and foresight by the exercise of proper care and caution cannot provide against them."

       - Where witnesses for both the plaintiff and defendants testified that the sewer which the lessor had contracted to keep in repair and which overflowed, causing damage to plaintiff's property, was partially stopped up, that the water was not passing through it as it normally did, and that large quantities of debris were cleaned out of it after this rain, and that previously there had been other rains there about as heavy as the one on the afternoon in question, the evidence as to the rain was not sufficient to authorize a jury to find that the rain was an "act of God," in the legal sense of this term.

       - While the striking of the main line of an electric utility by lightning was an "act of God," the utility's permitting it to travel across lateral wire into the plaintiff's room, instead of arranging for it to be conducted into the ground, was not an act free from human agency.

        Sudden loss of consciousness
       
       by itself may come within the definition of "act of God"; yet an "act of God" means a casualty which is not only not due to human agency, but is one which is in no wise contributed to by human agency, and an act which may be prevented by the exercise of ordinary care is not an "act of God." Jackson v. Co-op Cab Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">117 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       To establish an "act of God" defense based on illness producing a loss of consciousness, the driver must show that the loss of consciousness produced the accident without any contributing negligence on the part of the driver. Lewis v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">238 Ga. App. 6</cite>, <cite class="app_court">517 S.E.2d 538</cite> (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Loss of consciousness by a driver would not be a complete defense if by the exercise of ordinary care it was foreseeable to the driver that the driver might lose consciousness while driving; even if loss of consciousness was not foreseeable, it would still not be a complete defense if the evidence showed the loss of consciousness occurred, not suddenly, but in a manner that would have allowed a reasonable driver to take some action to avoid the ensuing accident. Lewis v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">238 Ga. App. 6</cite>, <cite class="app_court">517 S.E.2d 538</cite> (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the plaintiff failed to produce any specific facts rebutting the defendant's affirmative defense of sudden loss of consciousness and the plaintiff failed to show there was a genuine issue for trial, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant. Lewis v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">238 Ga. App. 6</cite>, <cite class="app_court">517 S.E.2d 538</cite> (1999).

        <p>
       When the uncontradicted evidence in a suit involving two drivers showed that just before running a red light, the second driver had suffered a sudden and unforeseeable loss of consciousness, the co-executor for the second driver had established a prima facie case of an "act of God" defense under O.C.G.A.

       Truck driver's estate sufficiently established the affirmative defense of an "act of God" for purposes of a claim of negligence arising from a vehicle collision caused by the truck driver having a stroke and veering into a car in another lane of traffic; there was uncontradicted evidence that the truck driver had an unforeseeable loss of consciousness just prior to losing control of the truck.

       True rule for the construction of the word "may" in a statute
      
      is, that when such statute concerns the public interest, or affects the rights of third persons, then the word "may" shall be construed to mean "must" or "shall." "May" is held to mean shall in two cases: (1) where the thing to be done is for the sake of justice; or (2) is for the public benefit. Jennings v.

       Where a statute in permissive terms provides for the performance of some act

       Trial judge is not vested with discretion in matter of taxing costs against convicted defendant.

       Prior to November 1, 1982, a county correctional institute was not a "penitentiary"

       - Where the language in the face of a promissory note recites that it is a sealed instrument, and the signature of an accommodation endorser on the back of the note is accompanied by a "seal" or its equivalent, it is unnecessary for an additional recital to appear on the back of the note above the signature of the endorser that the endorser's obligation is one under seal in order to render it such, and this is for the reason that the endorser's endorsement under seal accepts and binds the endorser, as a surety, upon the contract of the maker on the face of the paper, which includes the recitals above the signature of the maker.

       Definition of "sickness" is codification from the decision in Martin v. Waycross Coca-Cola Bottling Co.,
      
      <cite class="ga_app_court">18 Ga. App. 226</cite>, <cite class="app_court">89 S.E. 495</cite> (1916), which was an action for damages based on the alleged negligence of the defendant causing the sickness of the plaintiff; that decision quotes the definition of "sickness" in Black's Law Dictionary as including "any morbid condition of the body . . . which for the time being hinders and prevents the organs from normally discharging their several functions." American Life Ins. Co. v. Stone, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga. App. 98</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 231</cite> (1948).

       <p>
        <p>
       - The words "sickness" and "disease" are technically synonymous, but when given the popular meaning, as required in construing a contract of insurance, "sickness" is a condition interfering with one's usual activities, whereas "disease" may exist without such result. Georgia Int'l Life Ins. Co. v. Harden, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">280 S.E.2d 863</cite> (1981).

       <p>
        <p>
       - One is not ordinarily considered sick who performs one's usual occupation, though some organ of the body may be affected, but is regarded as sick when such diseased condition has advanced far enough to incapacitate the person. Georgia Int'l Life Ins. Co. v. Harden, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">280 S.E.2d 863</cite> (1981).

       - In determining what losses are covered by policies insuring against losses on account of "disease" or "sickness," the general rule that ambiguous or uncertain provisions will be construed most favorably to the insured is applied. Georgia Int'l Life Ins. Co. v. Harden, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">280 S.E.2d 863</cite> (1981).

        <p>
       - While a hernia is frequently caused by an accident or an injury, it does not follow that a hernia is never the result of a "sickness" or "disease." American Life Ins. Co. v. Stone, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga. App. 98</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 231</cite> (1948).

        It was jury question whether or not hernia not disabling to any extent was "sickness"

       - Where there was evidence that the attorney who prepared the will enabled the testatrix, who because of the testatrix's physical condition could not write, to make the testatrix's mark by placing the testatrix's hand upon the pen as the mark was made, this was sufficient to authorize the jury to find that the testatrix "signed" the will.

       - Where a railroad company blocks with its cars a crossing on a public highway for a needless or unreasonable length of time, a pedestrian, after waiting a reasonable time for the cars to be removed, may turn aside to avoid the obstruction and pass over the property of the company without being a "trespasser" in so doing.

       - In an action against a utility and power company for damages on theories of "trespass" and nuisance arising from electromagnetic radiation, a grant of summary judgment on the trespass claim and directed verdict on the nuisance claim were proper for policy reasons since the scientific evidence was inconclusive regarding the invasive quality of magnetic fields from power lines.

       Summary judgment was properly entered for a realtor as to a landowner's trespass claim, as the landowner never determined that the silt fence was actually on the landowner's property, and the realtor testified that the fence was located on a public right-of-way.

Laws looking only to the remedy or mode of trial may apply to contracts, rights, and offenses entered into, accrued, or committed prior to their passage; but in every case a reasonable time subsequent to the passage of the law should be allowed for the citizen to enforce his contract or to protect his right.

       - Only retrospective enactments which are ex post facto in their character, that is, those whose effect is to impair the obligation of contracts, or to divest vested rights, are within the constitutional prohibition against retroactive legislation. Hart v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">161 Ga.

        <p>
       - Georgia has a statutory policy disapproving the retroactive application of new statutes. However, this section expressly distinguishes laws looking only to the remedy or mode of trial. Sanks v. Georgia, <cite class="us_code">401 U.S. 144</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 593</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 741 (1971).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - A repealing statute which did not deprive the defendant of any substantial right but only regulated the procedure of the court, in which the defendant could acquire no right, is not within the inhibition against the passage of retroactive laws. Pritchard v. Savannah St. &amp; Rural Resort R.R., <cite class="ga_court">87 Ga. 294</cite>, <cite class="app_court">13 S.E. 493</cite>, <cite class="lra">14 L.R.A. 721</cite> (1891); Baker v.

         Statute void if it takes substantial right from accused.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While it is the rule that no one has a vested right in a mere mode of procedure, so that a statute merely regulating procedure and leaving untouched all the substantial protections with which existing law surrounds the person accused of a crime is not within the constitutional inhibition against ex post facto laws, yet a statute is void and ineffective as related to previous offenses if it takes from the accused a substantial right given to the accused by the law in force at the time to which the accused's guilt relates, and such a statute cannot be sustained simply because, in a general sense, it may be said to regulate procedure. Winston v. State, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 573</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 667</cite> (1938).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There is no ground upon which to hold a statute to be ex post facto which does nothing more than admit evidence of a particular kind in a criminal case upon an issue of fact which was not admissible under the rules of evidence as enforced at the time the offense was committed. Bryan v. Bryan, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 826</cite>, <cite class="app_court">251 S.E.2d 566</cite> (1979).

       - Generally, laws take effect from the date of their enactment and ignorance of the law is no excuse; thus, the contention of the petitioners that they were surprised by an amendment pleading an Act approved after the suit was instituted is without merit, and the trial judge did not abuse the judge's discretion in refusing to continue the case to the next term.

       - A public sector attorney's authority, like that of any other public officer, is defined and prescribed by law, including municipal ordinances; thus, a city and police officers who had entered a settlement agreement executed by city attorneys on their behalf were not estopped from challenging the agreement on the basis that a city ordinance restricted the apparent authority of the attorneys to execute the agreement, even though the ordinance was not specifically communicated to the opposing party.

        <p>
       - As between individuals, where no question of the general welfare of society or public policy is involved, the principle of estoppel runs throughout the law. Although an Act is unconstitutional and void, it will operate as an estoppel upon the party applying for it, and procuring its passage and accepting its benefits. Christopher v. Christopher, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 361</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 818</cite> (1944).

       - The right to child support belongs to the child, not the mother, and after the award has become part of the court's judgment she has no authority to waive it. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 664</cite>, <cite class="app_court">212 S.E.2d 835</cite> (1975).

        <p>
       - Homeowners retained the right to sue for damage done to their property, despite payment from their insurer, because language in proof of loss forms granted the insurer subrogation to the homeowners' rights, title, and interest in the property that was damaged, but not to the claim, and in any event the insurer expressly waived its right to subrogation in the release and settlement agreement executed contemporaneously with the issuance of the settlement payment.

       - Comity is reciprocity. It cannot be that the laws of the several states of the union differ so materially in policy or in the nature of their institutions as to require that unquestionable defensive right of every sovereignty, that of protecting its citizens against the operation of the laws or doctrines of another state, incompatible with their safety, or injurious to their interest.

        <p>
       - Although the states are sovereign entities, they are bound along with their officials, including their judges, by the United States Constitution and the federal statutory law. Principles of comity in the United States federal system require that the state courts be afforded the opportunity to perform their duty, which includes responding to attacks on state authority based on the federal law, or, if the litigation is wholly private, construing and applying the applicable federal requirements.

         Application in tort cases of lex loci delicto commissi.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - A state court ought to apply the substantive law of the state or county in which the tort occurred under the lex loci delicto commissi doctrine. However, if the application of foreign law would prove insurmountably difficult, state substantive law may govern given both parties' concurrence. Lavine v. General Mills, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 332 (N.D. Ga. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Lex loci governs as to the nature, construction and obligation of contracts.
       
       Missouri State Life Ins. Co. v. Lovelace, <cite class="ga_app_court">1 Ga. App. 446</cite>, <cite class="app_court">58 S.E. 93</cite> (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        The conflicts rule in this state is that where a contract is made and is to be performed in another state, the laws of the latter state will govern as to the validity, nature, obligation, and construction of the contract, where they are duly pleaded and proved, and such laws will be enforced by comity in this state unless they are contrary to public policy or prejudicial to the interests of this state. Rohner, Gehrig & Co. v. Capital City Bank, 655 F.2d 571 (5th Cir. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Law of the place where contract is made is prima facie that which parties intended
       
       and that such law ought, therefore, to prevail. King v. King, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 534</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 147</cite> (1962), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">375 U.S. 17</cite>, <cite class="s_court">84 S.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Rule of the lex loci will be applied in the federal courts sitting in Georgia
       
       and acting upon an instrument made and to be performed in this state. Martin v. Bartow Iron Works, <cite class="ga_court">35 Ga. 320</cite>, 16 F. Cas. 888 (N.D. Ga. 1867).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While the lex loci, as a general rule, governs the construction of contracts, it is subject, in practice, to the great controlling idea that they will not be enforced, by comity, if they involve anything immoral, contrary to general policy, or violative of the conscience of the state called on to give them effect. Eubanks v. Banks, <cite class="ga_court">34 Ga. 407</cite> (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where enforcement of a contract in Georgia draws public policy considerations into question,
       
       those public policy considerations will be determined according to laws of Georgia. Scherer v. Scherer, <cite class="ga_court">249 Ga. 635</cite>, <cite class="app_court">292 S.E.2d 662</cite> (1982).

         Local law, not lex loci, applicable to remedy on contracts.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - As a general principle, the lex loci applies only to the interpretation of contracts, and the remedy on them must be prosecuted according to the laws of the country in which the action is brought. Davis v. DeVaughn, <cite class="ga_app_court">7 Ga. App. 324</cite>, <cite class="app_court">66 S.E. 956</cite> (1910); Chamblee v. Colt Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">31 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       This rule applies only to the interpretation of the contract touching its validity, and does not apply to the question of the remedy thereon. Gaffe v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 673</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 512</cite>, answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">68 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where a suit upon a written contract executed and to be performed in another state is brought in a court of this state, the question whether or not the plaintiff's right of action is barred, being one relating exclusively to the remedy, must be determined with reference to the limitation laws of Georgia. Obear v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">97 Ga. 587</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E. 335</cite>, <cite class="lra">33 L.R.A. 384</cite> (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the validity and form of a contract executed and to be performed in another state must be determined by the laws of that state, yet when suit is brought thereon in a Georgia court, the limitation statutes of Georgia must be applied. Gaffe v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 673</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 512</cite>, answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">68 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The place where the contract is entered into is not to be exclusively considered, if the parties had in contemplation another place at the time of the contract, the laws of the latter will be preferred in the construction of the contract. Dunn v. Welsh, <cite class="ga_court">62 Ga. 241</cite> (1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Contracts are to be governed as to their nature, validity, and interpretation by the law of the place where they were made, except where it appears from the contract that it is to be performed in a state other than that in which it was made, in which case the laws of that sister state will be applied in the enforcement of any contract to be there performed, so long as such laws do not conflict with the statute, powers, or rights of the state wherein it was executed and sought to be enforced. Tillman v. Gibson, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 440</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 630</cite> (1931).

       <p>
        - Georgia courts regard statutes declaring gambling contracts and transactions illegal or void as embodying a distinctive public policy which requires the courts of this state to refuse to recognize or enforce any contract or transaction in violation of their terms, even though such contract or transaction may have had its situs outside the Georgia forum, by the laws of which situs it is valid, and therefore does not come within the direct operation of the Georgia statutes. The practical result of this view is that a gambling or wagering contract, in order to be upheld or enforced, must be valid both by its proper law - that is, by the law of its situs - and by the law of Georgia.

Awesome Bill from Dawsonville, a modest, unassuming, and unpretentious man, has become a household name in NASCAR racing and has been selected Most Popular Driver an unprecedented 16 times, Georgia Professional Athlete of the Year twice, National Motorsports Driver of the Year 14 times, and in 1998, was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. It is virtually impossible to list all of the honors and awards Million Dollar Bill has garnered over his incandescent career, but perhaps his most acclaimed accomplishment is his support, love, and respect from racing fans.He has given unstintingly of his time, talents, energy, and financial resources to numerous charities including the Special Olympics, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation and it is abundantly fitting and proper that this extraordinary Georgian be recognized in a special and lasting manner.

       - Ga. L. 2015, p. 108,
   §
   1/SB119, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) The Georgia Water Quality Control Act was passed by the Georgia General Assembly and signed into law in 1964 by Governor Carl Sanders;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2)
   At that time, there were 25 communities in Georgia which had no public sewer systems, 40 communities with a sewer system but no treatment facilities, 60 communities with a sewer system but only primary treatment facilities, 50 communities with a sewer system and secondary treatment facilities which were in need of improvement, and 395 industries which had documented untreated or inadequately treated discharges to Georgia's surface waters;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3)
   At the time of passage of the Act, many of Georgia's surface waters were extremely polluted, and serious water quality problems existed all over the State of Georgia;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4)
   The state established the Georgia Water Quality Control Board (later reconstituted as the Georgia Environmental Protection Division as a result of the 1972 Reorganization of State Government under Governor Jimmy Carter), and Governor Sanders appointed R.S. 'Rock' Howard to be the board's executive secretary;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5) By the time the Federal Water Quality Control Act was passed in 1972, most of Georgia's industries had been brought into compliance with the initial requirements of the federal Act;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6) Over the ensuing four decades, billions of federal, state, and local dollars have been invested in planning, designing, and constructing modern publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities throughout this state;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(7)
   Georgia's water professionals are committed to operating these facilities to maintain consistent compliance with extremely stringent standards;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(8)
   Both publicly and privately owned facilities have performed so well that they are no longer the most significant threat to Georgia's waters;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(9)
   The quality of Georgia's waters has improved dramatically throughout this great state over the years since the passage of the original Act;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(10)
   It is imperative that these improvements be sustained while continuing our efforts to educate Georgians of their growing responsibility in the reduction of non-point sources of pollution to Georgia's waters;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(11)
   The success that we have experienced thus far and the success that we will have is due to the tremendous dedication and efforts of Georgia's water professionals; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(12)
   It is fitting and proper that these individuals and their efforts be appropriately recognized."
