     Legislative immunity.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - Members of General Assembly are entitled to immunity against harassment of any type of legal action against them in connection with acts done by them in a strictly official capacity. Village of N. Atlanta v. Cook, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">133 S.E.2d 585</cite> (1963); Saleem v. Snow, <cite class="ga_app_court">217 Ga. App. 883</cite>, <cite class="app_court">460 S.E.2d 104</cite> (1995).
   </p>
   <h5 class="lalign">
    <b>
     Court not to concern itself with legislative action.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - Judiciary cannot modify, amend, or repeal legislative action, nor concern itself with the wisdom of it. That is a field in which only the legislature may work. Sirota v. Kay Homes, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 113</cite>, <cite class="app_court">65 S.E.2d 597</cite> (1951).
   </p>
   <h5 class="lalign">
    <b>
     Political question is not within jurisdiction of the judiciary.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    <p>
   - That the judiciary under the Constitution is wholly without jurisdiction to adjudicate a purely political question is not an open question. Also, it is the settled law of this state that actions of the General Assembly taken in virtue of a power conferred by the Constitution and in conforming with the provisions of the Constitution, are not subject to review by the courts. Thompson v. Talmadge, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 867</cite>, <cite class="app_court">41 S.E.2d 883</cite> (1947).

      <p>
       In the session of 1890-91, the first nonconstitutional provision relating to the composition of the House of Representatives was enacted by Ga. L. 1890-91, p. 192,
   §
   l, which was subsequently codified as
   §
   291 of the Civil Code of 1895. In the session of 1906, the first nonconstitutional provision relating to the composition of the Senate was enacted by Ga. L. 1906, p. 80,
   §
   1, which was subsequently codified as
   §
   334 of the Civil Code of 1910.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the enactment of the nonconstitutional provisions, there appeared in the Code beginning with the Code of 1895 parallel constitutional and nonconstitutional provisions relating to the composition of the General Assembly, which were codified as follows:

       - Where the corporate limits of a municipality include portions of two counties, and the notice of intention to apply for passage of a local bill is published as required by law in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements for the county of the legal situs of the municipality are published, and the local act in its enrolled form contains proof of such publication in the county of the legal situs of the municipality, this is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of article 3, section 7, paragraph 14 of the Constitution of 1945 (see now Ga.

       If the Committee on Ethics of the Senate or House of Representatives determines that the effective functioning of the committee requires the issuance of compulsory process to secure the attendance of a witness or the production of documents and materials, or if a person whose conduct is called into question in an investigation or other proceeding requests the issuance of such compulsory process, the chairperson or acting chairperson shall make application in writing to the presiding judge of the Superior Court of Fulton County for the issuance of an appropriate subpoena. Such application shall:

         In the case ofprocess to secure the attendance of a witness, identify the witness; the general nature of the questions to be propounded to the witness; and the reasons for believing that the testimony of the witness is likely to be relevant to the authorized scope of the investigation or proceeding;

Such measures may be so prefiled with the Clerk of the House by any one or more Representatives who will be eligible to consider the measure when introduced.

Such official assignment of a bill or resolution may take place only following the official introduction of the bill or resolution during the legislative session.

    - A mathematical formula fixing a maximum variance by which the population of a district may differ from the average district population is not possible, but a variance of more than 15 percent would be difficult, if not impossible, to justify. The court will base any test as to the reasonableness of variances on the departure figure of 15 percent. This does not mean a deliberate built-in variance of this degree but a good faith effort to meet the average with departure only where necessary to afford individual representation to as many counties as possible.

Instead, the plans arbitrarily and discriminatorily diluted and debased the weight of certain citizens' votes by intentionally and systematically underpopulating districts in rural south Georgia and inner-city Atlanta, correspondingly overpopulating the districts in suburban areas surrounding Atlanta, and by underpopulating the districts held by incumbent Democrats.

        - Special Master appointed to prepare state legislative reapportionment plans pursuant to court order was required to consider three principal criteria in drafting such plans: the U.S. Constitution; the federal Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.
   §
   1973; and neutral principles of redistricting such as compactness, contiguity, minimizing the splits of counties and municipalities, recognizing communities of interest, maintaining the cores of existing districts, and using well-defined boundaries as district lines, insofar as those policies did not conflict with the primary considerations of compliance with the one person, one vote principle and the Voting Rights Act.
   Special Master was also required to prefer single-member districts over multi-member districts. Larios v. Cox, 306 F. Supp. 2d 1214 (N.D. Ga. 2004).

        - Special Master's state legislative reapportionment plans ("Special Master's 1-B Plans") were adopted as the court's plans, since those plans complied fully with the Constitution and the principle of one person, one vote, the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.
   §
   1973 et seq., and the traditional redistricting guidelines of compactness, contiguity, minimizing the splits of counties, municipalities, and precincts, recognizing communities of interest, and avoiding multi-member districts. The court also was completely satisfied that the Special Master considered comments and objections concerning political incumbency as only a subordinated and secondary consideration. Larios v. Cox, 314 F. Supp. 2d 1357 (N.D. Ga. 2004).

   1973 et seq., and neutral principles of redistricting such as compactness, contiguity, minimizing the splits of counties and municipalities, recognizing communities of interest, maintaining the cores of existing districts, and using well-defined boundaries as district lines, insofar as those policies did not conflict with the primary considerations of compliance with the one person, one vote principle and the Voting Rights Act.
   Special Master was also required to prefer single-member districts over multi-member districts. Larios v. Cox, 306 F. Supp. 2d 1214 (N.D. Ga. 2004).

       <p>
        - Special Master's state legislative reapportionment plans ("Special Master's 1-B Plans") were adopted as the court's plans, since those plans complied fully with the Constitution and the principle of one person, one vote, the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.
   §
   1973 et seq., and the traditional redistricting guidelines of compactness, contiguity, minimizing the splits of counties, municipalities, and precincts, recognizing communities of interest, and avoiding multi-member districts. The court also was completely satisfied that the Special Master considered comments and objections concerning political incumbency as only a subordinated and secondary consideration. Larios v. Cox, 314 F. Supp. 2d 1357 (N.D. Ga. 2004).

        - The Code Revision Commission is authorized to grant an exclusive or nonexclusive license to the publisher, other than the book publisher, to publish the Official Code of Georgia Annotated on CD-ROM, which includes use of the annotations, indexes, notes, and other material written and typeset by the book publisher. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U94-16.
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of sales by multiple licensees of the CD-ROM edition of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated on the book edition is an appropriate matter for the Commission to consider in negotiating and granting licenses on behalf of the state. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U94-16.
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision to limit the number of licenses to be issued for publication of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated is a matter within the sound discretion of the Code Revision Commission guided by its duty to negotiate and grant licenses in Code materials "upon such terms and conditions as the commission shall determine to be in the best interest of the state."
