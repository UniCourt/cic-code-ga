        <li id="t31c01s31-1-3.2ol1a1">

        <li id="t31c01s31-1-3.2ol1a4">
         That children with hearing loss who do not receive such early intervention and treatment frequently require special educational services and that such services are publicly funded for the vast majority of children with hearing needs in the state;

         The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, the American Academy of Audiology, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery have recently endorsed the implementation of universal newborn hearing screenings and recommended that such screenings be performed in all birthing hospitals and coordinated by state departments of public health; and

Toward that end, on and after July 1, 2001, every licensed or certified hospital and physician shall educate the parents of newborn infants born in such hospitals of the importance of screening the hearing of newborn infants and follow-up care. Education shall not be considered a substitute for the hearing screening described in this subsection.

Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders are incurable, so appropriate lifetime care and treatment are necessities for maintaining optimum health. Advancements in drug therapies are allowing individuals greater latitude in managing their conditions, fostering independence, and minimizing chronic complications. As a result, individuals are living longer and are healthier and more productive. However, the rarity of these disorders coupled with the delicate processes of producing clotting factor concentrates makes treating these disorders extremely costly. It is the intent of the General Assembly to establish an advisory board to provide expert advice to the state on health and insurance policies, plans, and programs that impact individuals with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders."

The term "life-sustaining procedures" shall not include the provision of nourishment or hydration, but a patient may direct the withholding or withdrawal of the provision of nourishment or hydration in a POLST form.

Such form shall provide directions regarding the patient's end of life care and may be voluntarily executed by either a patient who has decision-making capacity and an attending physician or, if the patient does not have decision-making capacity, by the patient's authorized person and an attending physician; provided, however, that this shall not prevent a health care facility from imposing additional administrative or procedural requirements regarding a patient's end of life care decisions. A POLST form may be executed when a patient has a serious illness or condition and the attending physician's reasoned judgment is that the patient will die within the next 365 days; provided, however, that a POLST form may be executed at any time if a person has been diagnosed with dementia or another progressive, degenerative disease or condition that attacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking, and behavior.

An attending physician who has issued such an order and who transfers care of the patient to another physician shall inform the receiving physician and the health care facility, if applicable, of the order.

If the POLST form is signed by an authorized person who is not the health care agent named by the patient in an advance directive for health care, treatment indications on the POLST form may be implemented or become effective only when the patient is in a terminal condition or a state of permanent unconsciousness; provided, however, that a POLST form may become effective at any time if a person has been diagnosed with dementia or another progressive, degenerative disease or condition that attacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking, and behavior.

       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

   2/HB 324, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "(a) The General Assembly finds that the establishment of the Low THC Oil Patient Registry in 2015 allows Georgia patients to possess low THC oil but provides no way to access low THC oil. The General Assembly finds that thousands of Georgians have serious medical conditions that can be improved by the medically approved use of cannabis and that the law should not stand between them and treatment necessary for life and health. The General Assembly finds that the purpose of this Act is to allow the legitimate use of medical cannabis for health care, including palliative care. The General Assembly finds that this Act does not in any way diminish this state's strong public policy and laws against illegal drug use, nor should it be deemed in any manner to advocate, authorize, promote, or legally or socially accept the use of marijuana for children or adults for any nonmedical use.
      </p>

       "(b) The General Assembly further finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1)
   Low THC oil can offer significant medical benefits to patients;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2)
   Low THC oil can only be derived from the cannabis plant;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3)
   A carefully constructed system of in-state cultivation to benefit only those patients authorized by Georgia law and approved by their physician would benefit patients within the State of Georgia;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4)
   The State of Georgia is deeply opposed to any recreational or nonmedical use of marijuana, and any system to help patients access low THC oil should be as limited in scope as possible;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5)
   Business opportunities resulting from a system of in-state cultivation should be inclusive of minority, women, and veteran owned businesses;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6)
   Businesses resulting from this Act should include at least 20 percent participation by minority, women, and veteran owned businesses as licensees, suppliers, and partners of businesses licensed under this Act; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(7)
   The State of Georgia should encourage active participation by minority, women, and veteran owned businesses, as well as take any steps necessary to ensure there is no discrimination in the issuance of licenses or participation in business activities resulting from this Act."

     <p>
      The county board of health, at a regular or called meeting, at a time appropriate to the fiscal operation of the county, shall determine and fix the amount of money needed for the fiscal or calendar year, as the case may be, in accordance with a budget itemizing anticipated income and expenditure; the budget shall include any unobligated moneys carried over from the current period and funds to be made available from sources other than county taxes. The expenditures anticipated, after applying credits, shall be certified by the county board of health, with a copy of the budget, to the taxing authority of the county, which may fix and levy a tax rate sufficient to raise such amount at the same time and in the same manner prescribed for levying taxes for other county purposes, provided the taxing authority of the county deems the budget reasonable. If, however, the taxing authority of the county should deem the budget unreasonable, it shall promptly return the budget to the county board of health with its objections attached thereto for the purpose of resubmission.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The department is authorized, with the consent of the boards of health and the county authorities of the counties involved, to establish health districts composed of one or more counties. The county boards of health of the constituent counties shall, at the call of the commissioner, meet in joint session to approve the selection of a director appointed by the commissioner to serve such boards in common. A county board of health is authorized to appoint one of its members to represent the board at a joint meeting for this purpose. The director shall be a physician who is licensed to practice medicine under Chapter 34 of Title 43 and who otherwise meets the requirements of the rules of the State Personnel Board. The district director shall have the same powers, duties, and responsibility as a director serving a single county board of health. To further the purposes of this Code section, county boards of health may contract with each other for the provision of multicounty services and also exercise any additional powers as authorized by paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Code Section 31-3-4; and in the performance of such contracts a county board of health may utilize its employees in other counties.

       <p>

       - Division of Health Planning granting a certificate of need was not arbitrary and capricious as the proposed new institutional health service was reasonably consistent with the relevant goals and objectives of the State Health Plan as set forth in Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. r. 272-2-.08(b)(1), and it did not err in interpreting the 12-month rule in O.C.G.A.

       Ga. Comp. R. Regs. 111-2-2-.40, which provided that an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) that was part of a hospital was not subject to more stringent certificate of need (CON) specifications, was not unconstitutionally vague because it stated two clear examples of when an ASC was part of a hospital and provided that other situations would be considered under case-by-case review by the Department of Community Health.

       - Hospital could not decouple the hospital's Certificate of Need (CON) for a comprehensive in-patient rehabilitation (CIPR) program that was located in the hospital for hospital patients and transfer the program and the CON to a separately licensed rehabilitation facility without prior CON review and approval; the separate rehab facility was a "health care facility" and if the facility acquired the hospital's 16-bed CIPR program, then the rehab facility's CIPR program would expand from 56 beds to 72 beds.

The department shall immediately institute rule-making procedures to adopt such adjusted dollar amounts. In calculating the dollar amounts of a proposed project for purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (14) of Code Section 31-6-2, the costs of all items subject to review by this chapter and items not subject to review by this chapter associated with and simultaneously developed or proposed with the project shall be counted, except for the expenditure or commitment of or incurring an obligation for the expenditure of funds to develop certificate of need applications, studies, reports, schematics, preliminary plans and specifications or working drawings, or to acquire sites;

       A certificate of need issued to a destination cancer hospital shall authorize the beds and all new institutional health services of such destination cancer hospital. As used in this subsection, the term "new institutional health service" shall have the same meaning provided for in subsection (a) of this Code section. A certificate of need shall only be issued to a destination cancer hospital that locates itself and all affiliated facilities within 25 miles of a commercial airport in this state with five or more runways. Such destination cancer hospital shall not be required to apply for or obtain additional certificates of need for new institutional health services related to the treatment of cancer patients, and such new institutional health services related to the treatment of cancer patients offered by the destination cancer hospital shall not be reviewed under any service-specific need methodology or rules except for those promulgated by the department for destination cancer hospitals. After commencing operations, in order to add an additional new institutional health service, a destination cancer hospital shall apply for and obtain an additional certificate of need under the applicable statutory provisions and any rules promulgated by the department for destination cancer hospitals, and such applications shall only be granted if the patient base of such destination cancer hospital is composed of at least 65 percent of out-of-state patients for two consecutive years. The department may apply rules for a destination cancer hospital only for those services that the department determines are to be used by the destination cancer hospital in connection with the treatment of cancer. In no case shall destination cancer hospital specific rules be used in the case of an application for open heart surgery, perinatal services, cardiac catheterization, and other services deemed by the department to be not reasonably related to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer; provided, however, that the department shall apply the destination cancer hospital specific rules if a destination cancer hospital applies for services and equipment required for it to meet federal or state laws applicable to a hospital. If such destination cancer hospital cannot show a patient base of a minimum of 65 percent from outside of this state, then its application for any new institutional health service shall be evaluated under the specific statutes and rules applicable to that particular service. If such destination cancer hospital applies for a certificate of need to add an additional new institutional health service before commencing operations or completing two consecutive years of operation, such applicant may rely on historical data from its affiliated entities, as set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection (b.1) of Code Section 31-6-42. Because destination cancer hospitals provide services primarily to out-of-state residents, the number of beds, services, and equipment destination cancer hospitals use shall not be counted as part of the department's inventory when determining the need for those items by other providers. No person shall be issued more than one certificate of need for a destination cancer hospital. Nothing in this Code section shall in any way require a destination cancer hospital to obtain a certificate of need for any purpose that is otherwise exempt from the certificate of need requirement. Beginning January 1, 2010, the department shall not accept any application for a certificate of need for a new destination cancer hospital; provided, however, all other provisions regarding the upgrading, replacing, or purchasing of diagnostic or therapeutic equipment shall be applicable to an existing destination cancer hospital.

       The commissioner shall be authorized, with the approval of the board, to place a temporary moratorium of up to six months on the issuance of certificates of need for new and emerging health care services. Any such moratorium placed shall be for the purpose of promulgating rules and regulations regarding such new and emerging health care services. A moratorium may be extended one time for an additional three months if circumstances warrant, as approved by the board. In the event that final rules and regulations are not promulgated within the time period allowed by the moratorium, any applications received by the department for a new and emerging health care service shall be reviewed under existing general statutes and regulations relating to certificates of need.

       - Hospital could not decouple the hospital's Certificate of Need (CON) for a comprehensive in-patient rehabilitation (CIPR) program that was located in the hospital for hospital patients and transfer the program and the CON to a separately licensed rehabilitation facility without prior CON review and approval; the separate rehab facility was a "health care facility" and if the facility acquired the hospital's 16-bed CIPR program, then the rehab facility's CIPR program would expand from 56 beds to 72 beds.

       Trial court erred in reversing the grant of a certificate of need on the ground that the applicant was attempting to circumvent a cease-and-desist order issued to a corporation owned by the same individual as the applicant; by seeking the certificate of need, the applicant was not doing anything that the law did not allow, the Department of Community Health held an extensive evidentiary hearing before granting the application, and the trial court improperly disregarded the corporate forms of the corporation and the applicant based on the fact that they were owned by the same individual.

        <p>
       Because the hearing officer's factual findings and conclusions of law were consistent with an application of the atypical barrier exception to remedy a barrier to services faced by an identified group of patients, and not to award a certificate of need (CON) simply for the purpose of making it more convenient for patients, the plaintiff did not show that the defendant in the defendant's final order violated Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 111-2-2-.42(3)(b)4, the Certificate of Need Act, or the Hughston Surgical criteria. Kennestone Hosp. v. Dep't of Cmty. Health, <cite class="ga_app_court">346 Ga.

       Substantial evidence supported the Department of Community Health's (Department) finding of a need for the proposed hospital based on rising population, general growth in the area, and increased emergency room usage at other hospitals and, thus, the Department was authorized to conclude that the appellee's certificate of need application met the general need requirements for a new short-stay hospital.

       - Given the ability of an area's patients to secure adult open-heart surgery service at a significant rate, the Georgia Health Planning Review Board (now Certificate of Need Appeal Panel) did not exceed the board's authority, abuse the board's discretion, act arbitrarily or without substantial evidence, or otherwise err by rejecting the hearing officer's determination that a certificate of need (CON) should be issued to the area's medical center under a geographical barrier exception to the Georgia Department of Community Health's CON regulations. The Board determined that neither the use of out-of-state services, nor the reluctance of the area's physicians to refer patients to in-state facilities, created a geographical barrier warranting an exception.

       Appellate court reinstated the agency denial of a Certificate of Need to establish an inpatient psychiatric hospital because the agency's conclusion that the applicant did not meet the applicant's burden of establishing no adverse impact on similar existing programs was supported by substantial evidence, in particular, expert testimony and exhibits regarding the applicant's unrealistic projections, overinflated market share, and failure to account for an existing facility's additional 30 pediatric beds.

       - Determination by the State Health Planning Agency (now Department of Community Health) that the establishment of open heart surgery service at two applying hospitals would adversely impact existing service was supported by evidence that open heart service at another hospital would be reduced to less than 350 procedures annually and by more than ten percent of its total annual volume.

       Trial court erred by reversing a decision of the Department of Community Health denying an ambulatory surgery center's application for a certificate of need to develop an orthopedic center in a city as the trial court substituted the court's own judgment for that of the agency since the Department made a finding that the service area already had a surplus of operating rooms, which were significantly underutilized, and the ambulatory surgery center failed to prove that any specific patient population was in need of the new center or that any barrier to quality care existed.

        <p>
       Appellate court reinstated the agency denial of a Certificate of Need to establish an inpatient psychiatric hospital because the agency's conclusion that the applicant did not meet the applicant's burden of establishing no adverse impact on similar existing programs was supported by substantial evidence, in particular, expert testimony and exhibits regarding the applicant's unrealistic projections, overinflated market share, and failure to account for an existing facility's additional 30 pediatric beds.

       <p>
        <p>
       Reversal of the agency and denial of a Certificate of Need (CON) was affirmed because the atypical barrier exception did not support the agency's grant of the CON as its interpretation of the atypical barrier exception in the rule was inconsistent with the plain language of the rule, clearly erroneous, and prejudiced the substantial rights of the challenging hospitals who already provided the same services.

       - Given the ability of an area's patients to secure adult open-heart surgery service at a significant rate, the Georgia Health Planning Review Board (now Certificate of Need Appeal Panel) did not exceed the board's authority, abuse the board's discretion, act arbitrarily or without substantial evidence, or otherwise err by rejecting the hearing officer's determination that a certificate of need (CON) should be issued to the area's medical center under a geographical barrier exception to the Georgia Department of Community Health's CON regulations. The Board determined that neither the use of out-of-state services, nor the reluctance of the area's physicians to refer patients to in-state facilities, created a geographical barrier warranting an exception.

       Appellate court reinstated the agency denial of a Certificate of Need to establish an inpatient psychiatric hospital because the agency's conclusion that the applicant did not meet the applicant's burden of establishing no adverse impact on similar existing programs was supported by substantial evidence, in particular, expert testimony and exhibits regarding the applicant's unrealistic projections, overinflated market share, and failure to account for an existing facility's additional 30 pediatric beds.

       Effective July 1, 2008, there is created the Certificate of Need Appeal Panel, which shall be an agency separate and apart from the department and shall consist of a panel of independent hearing officers. The purpose of the appeal panel shall be to serve as a panel of independent hearing officers to review the department's initial decision to grant or deny a certificate of need application. The Health Planning Review Board which existed on June 30, 2008, shall cease to exist after that date and the Certificate of Need Appeal Panel shall be constituted effective July 1, 2008, pursuant to this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1b">
       On and after July 1, 2008, the appeal panel shall be composed of five members appointed by the Governor for a term of up to four years each. The Governor shall appoint to the appeal panel attorneys who practice law in this state and who are familiar with the health care industry but who do not have a financial interest in or represent or have any compensation arrangement with any health care facility. Each member of the appeal panel shall be an active member of the State Bar of Georgia in good standing, and each attorney shall have maintained such active status for the five years immediately preceding such person's appointment. The Governor shall name from among such members a chairperson and a vice chairperson of the appeal panel. The vice chairperson shall have the same authority as the chairperson; provided, however, the vice chairperson shall not exercise such authority unless expressly delegated by the chairperson or in the event the chairperson becomes incapacitated, as determined by the Governor. Vacancies on the appeal panel caused by resignation, death, or any other cause shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointment. No person required to register with the Secretary of State as a lobbyist or registered agent shall be eligible for appointment by the Governor to the appeal panel.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1c">
       The appeal panel shall promulgate reasonable rules for its operation and rules of procedure for the conduct of initial administrative appeal hearings held by the appointed hearing officers, including an appropriate fee schedule for filing such appeals. Members of the appeal panel shall serve as hearing officers for appeals that are assigned to them on a random basis by the chairperson of the appeal panel. The members of the appeal panel shall receive no salary but shall be reimbursed for their expenses in attending meetings and for transportation costs as authorized by Code Section 45-7-21, which provides for compensation and allowances of certain state officials; provided, however, that the chairperson and vice chairperson of the appeal panel shall also be compensated for their services rendered to the appeal panel outside of attendance at an appeal panel meeting, such as for time spent assigning hearing officers, the amount of which compensation shall be determined according to regulations of the Department of Administrative Services. Appeal panel members shall receive compensation for the administration of the cases assigned to them, including prehearing, hearing, and posthearing work, in an amount determined to be appropriate and reasonable by the Department of Administrative Services. Such compensation to the members of the appeal panel shall be made by the Department of Administrative Services.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1d">
       Any party that is permitted to oppose an application pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of Code Section 31-6-43 that has notified the department prior to its decision that such party is opposed to the application before the department shall have the right to an initial administrative appeal hearing before an appeal panel hearing officer or to intervene in such hearing. Such request for hearing or intervention shall be filed with the chairperson of the appeal panel within 30 days of the date of the decision made pursuant to Code Section 31-6-43. In the event an appeal is filed by a party that is permitted to oppose an application pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of Code Section 31-6-43, the appeal shall be accompanied by payment of such fee as is established by the appeal panel. In the event an appeal is requested, the chairperson of the appeal panel shall appoint a hearing officer for each such hearing within 30 days after the date the appeal is received. Within 14 days after the appointment of the hearing officer, such hearing officer shall confer with the parties and set the date or dates for the hearing, provided that no hearing shall be scheduled less than 60 days nor more than 120 days after the filing of the request for a hearing, unless the applicant consents or, in the case of competing applicants, all applicants consent to an extension of this time period to a specified date. Unless the applicant consents or, in the case of competing applicants, all applicants consent to an extension of said 120 day period, any hearing officer who regularly fails to commence a hearing within the required time period shall not be eligible for continued service as a hearing officer for the purposes of this Code section. The hearing officer shall have the authority to dispose of all motions made by any party before the issuance of the hearing officer's decision and shall make such rulings as may be required for the conduct of the hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1e">
       In fulfilling the functions and duties of this chapter, the hearing officer shall act, and the hearing shall be conducted as a full evidentiary hearing, in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," relating to contested cases, except as otherwise specified in this Code section. Subject to the provisions of Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50, all files, working papers, studies, notes, and other writings or information used by the department in making its decision shall be public records and available to the parties, and the hearing officer may permit each party to exercise such reasonable rights of prehearing discovery of such information used by the parties as will expedite the hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1f">
       In addition to evidence submitted to the department, a party may present any additional relevant evidence to the appeal panel hearing officer reviewing the decision of the department if the evidence was not reasonably available to the party presenting the evidence at the time of the department's review. The burden of proof as to whether the evidence was reasonably available shall be on the party attempting to introduce the new evidence. The issue for the decision by the hearing officer shall be whether, and the hearing officer shall order the issuance of a certificate of need if, in the hearing officer's judgment, the application is consistent with the considerations as set forth in Code Section 31-6-42 and the department's rules, as the hearing officer deems such considerations and rules applicable to the review of the project. The appeal hearing conducted by the appeal panel hearing officer shall be a de novo review of the decision of the department. The hearing officer shall also consider:
       <ol>
        <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1f1">
         Whether the department committed prejudicial procedural error in its consideration of the application;

         Whether the appeal lacks substantial justification; and

         Whether such appeal was undertaken primarily for the purpose of delay or harassment.
         <p>
          The burden of proof shall be on the appellant. Appellants or applicants shall proceed first with their cases before the hearing officer in the order determined by the hearing officer, and the department, if a party, shall proceed last. In the event of a consolidated hearing on applications which were joined for comparative review pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 31-6-43, the hearing officer shall have the same powers specified for the department in subsection (f) of Code Section 31-6-43 to order the issuance of no certificate of need or one or more certificates of need.

      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1g">
       All evidence shall be presented at the initial administrative appeal hearing conducted by the appointed hearing officer. A party or intervenor may present any relevant evidence on all issues raised by the hearing officer or any party to the hearing or revealed during discovery and shall not be limited to evidence or information presented to the department prior to its decision, except that an applicant may not present a new need study or analysis responsive to the general need consideration or service-specific need formula as provided in the applicable rules that is substantially different from any such study or analysis submitted to the department prior to its decision and that could have reasonably been available for submission. The hearing officer may consider the latest data available, including updates of studies previously submitted, in deciding whether an application is consistent with the applicable considerations or rules. The hearing officer shall consider the applicable considerations and rules in effect on the date the appeal is filed, even if the provisions of those considerations or rules were changed after the department's decision. The hearing officer may remand a matter to the department if the hearing officer determines that it would be beneficial for the department to consider new data, studies, or analyses that were not available before the decision or changes to the provisions of the applicable considerations or rules made after the department's decision. The hearing officer shall establish the time deadlines for completion of the remand and shall retain jurisdiction of the matter throughout the completion of the remand.

       After the issuance of a decision by the department pursuant to Code Section 31-6-43, no party to an appeal hearing, nor any person on behalf of such party, including the department, shall make any ex parte contact with the appeal panel hearing officer appointed to conduct the appeal hearing, any other member of the appeal panel, or the commissioner in regard to a decision under appeal.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1i">
       Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of law as to each consideration as set forth in Code Section 31-6-42 and the department's rules, including a detailed statement of the reasons for the decision of the hearing officer. If any party has alleged that an appeal lacks substantial justification or was undertaken primarily for the purpose of delay or harassment, the decision of the hearing officer shall make findings of fact addressing the merits of the allegation. The hearing officer shall file such decision with the chairperson of the appeal panel who shall serve such decision upon all parties, and shall transmit the administrative record to the commissioner. Any party, including the department, which disputes any finding of fact or conclusion of law rendered by the hearing officer in such hearing officer's decision and which wishes to appeal that decision may appeal to the commissioner and shall file its specific objections with the commissioner or his or her designee within 30 days of the date of the hearing officer's decision pursuant to rules adopted by the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c06s31-6-44ol1j">
       The decision of the appeal panel hearing officer will become the final decision of the department upon the sixty-first day following the date of the decision unless an objection thereto is filed with the commissioner within the time limit established in subsection (i) of this Code section.

         In the event an appeal of the hearing officer's decision is filed, the commissioner may adopt the hearing officer's order as the final order of the department or the commissioner may reject or modify the conclusions of law over which the department has substantive jurisdiction and the interpretation of administrative rules over which it has substantive jurisdiction. By rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule, the department must state with particularity its reasons for rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule and must make a finding that its substituted conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule is as or more reasonable than that which was rejected or modified. Rejection or modification of conclusions of law may not form the basis for rejection or modification of findings of fact. The commissioner may not reject or modify the findings of fact unless the commissioner first determines from a review of the entire record, and states with particularity in the order, that the findings of fact were not based upon any competent substantial evidence or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with the essential requirements of law.

         If, before the date set for the commissioner's decision, application is made to the commissioner for leave to present additional evidence and it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the additional evidence is material and there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceedings before the hearing officer, the commissioner may order that the additional evidence be taken before the same hearing officer who rendered the initial decision upon conditions determined by the commissioner. The hearing officer may modify the initial decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decision with the commissioner. Unless leave is given by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the appeal panel may not consider new evidence under any circumstances. In all circumstances, the commissioner's decision shall be based upon considerations as set forth in Code Section 31-6-42 and the department's rules.

       If, based upon the findings of fact by the hearing officer, the commissioner determines that the appeal filed by any party of a decision of the department lacks substantial justification and was undertaken primarily for the purpose of delay or harassment, the commissioner may enter an award in his or her written order against such party and in favor of the successful party or parties, including the department, of all or any part of their respective reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, as the commissioner deems just. Such award may be enforced by any court undertaking judicial review of the final decision. In the absence of any petition for judicial review, then such award shall be enforced, upon due application, by any court having personal jurisdiction over the party against whom such an award is made.

       Unless the hearing officer's decision becomes the department's final decision by operation of law as provided in subsection (j) of this Code section, the decision of the commissioner shall become the department's final decision by operation of law. Such final decision shall be the final department decision for purposes of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." The appeals process provided by this Code section shall be the administrative remedy only for decisions made by the department pursuant to Code Section 31-6-43 which involve the approval or denial of applications for certificates of need.

       A party responding to an appeal to the commissioner may be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs of such appeal if it is determined that the appeal lacked substantial justification and was undertaken primarily for the purpose of delay or harassment; provided, however, that the department shall not be required to pay attorney's fees or costs. This subsection shall not apply to the portion of attorney's fees accrued on behalf of a party responding to or bringing a challenge to the department's authority to enact a rule or regulation or the department's jurisdiction or another challenge that could not have been decided in the administrative proceeding, nor shall it apply to costs accrued when the only argument raised by the appealing party is one described in this subsection.

       - Health Planning Review Board (now Certificate of Need Appeal Panel) is a solely adjudicatory, quasi-judicial body, and is an inappropriate party to an appeal of the board's rulings in court. A decision by the Health Planning Review Board is a final administrative decision for purposes of judicial appeal, and the Health Planning Agency, not the Review Board, is the proper party respondent to a petition seeking judicial review of the board's determination.

         Powers of administrative review.

        <p>
       - Review board, in reversing a decision of the Health Planning Agency (now Department of Community Health) which had denied a certificate of need for construction of a nursing home in Alpharetta County, acted beyond the board's powers of administrative review of contested cases by deeming the "County Deficit Rule" of the planning agency inapplicable in a controversy to which the rule applied by the rule's express terms, or by applying the rule to part of the county instead of to the entire county. Dogwood Square Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. State Health Planning Agency, <cite class="ga_court">255 Ga. 694</cite>, <cite class="app_court">341 S.E.2d 432</cite> (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Review Board's reliance upon the principles of res judicata
       
       to deny an application for a certificate of need was authorized since the original application had been denied on the basis of the "County Deficit Rule" and the applicant did not introduce evidence upon reapplication which was sufficient to show that the applicant's proposed facility would comport with the same rule. State Health Planning Agency v. Cribb Indus., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">204 Ga. App. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">419 S.E.2d 123</cite> (1992).

         Evidence sustaining denial of applications.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Determination by the State Health Planning Agency (now Department of Community Health) that the establishment of open heart surgery service at two applying hospitals would adversely impact existing service was supported by evidence that open heart service at another hospital would be reduced to less than 350 procedures annually and by more than ten percent of the total annual volume. Hospital Auth. v. State Health Planning Agency, <cite class="ga_app_court">211 Ga. App. 407</cite>, <cite class="app_court">438 S.E.2d 912</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Given the ability of an area's patients to secure adult open-heart surgery service at a significant rate, the Georgia Health Planning Review Board (now Certificate of Need Appeal Panel) did not exceed the board's authority, abuse the board's discretion, act arbitrarily or without substantial evidence, or otherwise err by rejecting the hearing officer's determination that a certificate of need (CON) should be issued to the area's medical center under a geographical barrier exception to the Georgia Department of Community Health's CON regulations. The Board determined that neither the use of out-of-state services, nor the reluctance of the area's physicians to refer patients to in-state facilities, created a geographical barrier warranting an exception. Ga. Dep't of Cmty. Health v. Satilla Health Servs., <cite class="ga_app_court">266 Ga. App. 880</cite>, <cite class="app_court">598 S.E.2d 514</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Appellate court reinstated the agency denial of a Certificate of Need to establish an inpatient psychiatric hospital because the agency's conclusion that the applicant did not meet the applicant's burden of establishing no adverse impact on similar existing programs was supported by substantial evidence, in particular, expert testimony and exhibits regarding the applicant's unrealistic projections, overinflated market share, and failure to account for an existing facility's additional 30 pediatric beds. Tanner Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Vest Newnan, LLC, <cite class="ga_app_court">337 Ga. App. 884</cite>, <cite class="app_court">789 S.E.2d 258</cite> (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Reversal of the agency and denial of a Certificate of Need (CON) was affirmed because the atypical barrier exception did not support the agency's grant of the CON as the agency's interpretation of the atypical barrier exception in the rule was inconsistent with the plain language of the rule, clearly erroneous, and prejudiced the substantial rights of the challenging hospitals who already provided the same services. ASMC, LLC v. Northside Hosp., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">344 Ga. App. 576</cite>, <cite class="app_court">810 S.E.2d 663</cite> (2018), cert. denied, 2018 Ga. LEXIS 610 (Ga. 2018).

       - Trial court erred in reversing the grant of a certificate of need on the ground that the applicant was attempting to circumvent a cease-and-desist order issued to a corporation owned by the same individual as the applicant; by seeking the certificate of need, the applicant was not doing anything that the law did not allow, the Department of Community Health held an extensive evidentiary hearing before granting the application, and the trial court improperly disregarded the corporate forms of the corporation and the applicant based on the fact that they were owned by the same individual. Global Diagnostic Dev., LLC v. Diagnostic Imaging of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">284 Ga. App. 66</cite>, <cite class="app_court">643 S.E.2d 338</cite> (2007).

       Superior court erred in reversing a decision of the Georgia Department of Community Health, which awarded a medical center a certificate of need, because the agency's decision was supported by substantial evidence, and the department's interpretation of the applicable regulations, as requiring only an amendment of the center's application, rather than a new application, was not plainly erroneous.

       - When the Department of Community Health's denial of a certificate of need was affirmed, the appellants' motion for attorney fees was improperly denied because the superior court's order on remand denied the appellee's petition, thus establishing that the appellants were the prevailing parties of the appeal to the superior court as decided by a final order of that court; the appellate court's previous order noted that a fee award in favor of the appellants would be issued following the return of the remittitur to the trial court; and the appellate court's previous decision affirmed the denial of the certificate on grounds independent of the appellee's constitutional challenge to the need rule, thus mooting those issues.

      The department shall require prior notice from a new health care facility for approval of any activity which is believed to be exempt pursuant to Code Section 31-6-47 or excluded from the requirements of this chapter under other provisions of this chapter. The department may require prior notice and approval of any activity which is believed to be exempt pursuant to paragraphs (10), (15), (16), (17), (20), (21), (23), (25), (26), (27), (28), and (29) of subsection (a) of Code Section 31-6-47. The department shall establish timeframes, forms, and criteria to request a letter of determination that an activity is properly exempt or excluded under this chapter prior to its implementation. The department shall publish notice of all requests for letters of determination regarding exempt activity and opposition to such request. Persons opposing a request for approval of an exempt activity shall be entitled to file an objection with the department and the department shall consider any filed objection when determining whether an activity is exempt. After the department's decision, an opposing party shall have the right to a fair hearing pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," on an adverse decision of the department and judicial review of a final decision in the same manner and under the same provisions as in Code Section 31-6-44.1. If no objection to a request for determination is filed within 30 days of the department's receipt of such request for determination, the department shall have 60 days from the date of the department's receipt of such request to review the request and issue a letter of determination. The department may adopt rules for deciding when it is not practicable to provide a determination in 60 days and may extend the review period upon written notice to the requestor but only for an extended period of no longer than an additional 30 days.

       Because the Georgia Society of Ambulatory Surgical Centers represented the interests of members that had adequate administrative remedies, and those members had not exhausted those remedies, the trial court was required to dismiss its case alleging that an annual survey the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) issued to ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) sought information beyond the scope of O.C.G.A.

    <p>
     - Since the requirement of carrying adequate casualty insurance is a matter which does not pertain to protection of health and lives of patients in institutions nor to kind and quality of building, equipment, facilities and institutional services that institutions shall have and use in order to properly care for patients, the Department of Human Resources (now the Department of Community Health for these purposes) cannot legally pass a valid rule requiring institutions to carry adequate casualty insurance. 1967 Op.

       To sue and be sued;

       To sell to others, or to lease to others for any number of years up to a maximum of 40 years, any lands, buildings, structures, or facilities constituting all or any part of any existing or hereafter established project. In the event a hospital authority undertakes to sell a hospital facility, such authority shall, prior to the execution of a contract of sale, provide reasonable public notice of such sale and provide for a public hearing to receive comments from the public concerning such sale. This power shall be unaffected by the language set forth in paragraph (13) of this Code section or any implications arising therefrom unless grants of assistance have been received by the authority with respect to such lands, buildings, structures, or facilities, in which case approval in writing as set forth in paragraph (13) of this Code section shall be obtained prior to selling or leasing to others within 20 years after completion of construction;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c07s31-7-75ol17">

Any lessee shall agree in the lease to pay rent sufficient in each year to pay the principal of and the interest on any revenue anticipation certificates proposed to be issued to finance the cost of the construction or acquisition of any such project and to pay off or refinance, in whole or in part, any outstanding debt or obligation of the lessee (including any redemption or prepayment premium due thereon) which was incurred in connection with the acquisition and construction of facilities of such lessee and the amount necessary in the opinion of the authority to be paid each year into any reserve funds which the authority may deem advisable to be established in connection with the retirement of the proposed revenue anticipation certificates and the maintenance of the project. Any such lease shall further provide that the cost of all insurance with respect to the project and the cost of maintenance and repair thereof shall be borne by the lessee. In carrying out a refinancing plan with regard to any outstanding debt or obligation of the lessee which was incurred in connection with the acquisition and construction of facilities of such lessee, the authority may use proceeds of any revenue anticipation certificates issued for such purpose to acquire such outstanding debt or obligation, in whole or in part, and may itself or through a fiduciary or agent hold and pledge such acquired debt or obligation as security for the payment of such revenue anticipation certificates. The powers granted in this paragraph shall be unaffected by the language set forth in paragraph (13) of this Code section or any implications arising therefrom unless grants of assistance have been received by the authority with respect to such project, in which case approval in writing as set forth in paragraph (13) of this Code section shall be obtained prior to leasing to others within 20 years after completion of construction. Any revenues derived by the authority from any such lease shall be applied by the authority to the payment of any revenue anticipation certificates issued in connection with the acquisition and construction of the project and the payment, in whole or in part, of any outstanding debt or obligation of the lessee which was incurred in connection with the acquisition and construction of facilities of such lessee (including any redemption or prepayment premium due thereon) or to the payment of any other expenses incurred in connection with acquiring, financing, maintaining, expanding, operating, or equipping the project;

       <p>
        <p>
       - Under the Hospital Authorities Law, the governmental obligation to provide for the health of people can be discharged by acquisition of existing hospital facilities, by construction of completely new hospitals, and by sale or lease of hospital to others (as well as by the hospital authority's operation thereof).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since corporations are separate and distinct entities in the eyes of the law, notwithstanding even common ownership of two corporations and the relationship of one corporation as the wholly-owned subsidiary of another, the requirement that there be a lease to others is fully satisfied by a lease between two such related corporations.

       - Even assuming a purely charitable purpose is not involved in a project, the project's funding by a hospital authority does not violate Ga. Const. 1976, Art. IX, Sec. IV, Para. III (see now Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, Sec. II, Para. VIII), because a hospital authority is not a county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision of this state. Bradfield v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Hospital authority's resolution requiring a physician to use in-house facilities and services for hospital patients, where offered, does not invade a physician's province. Although the physician is required to use the facilities and equipment provided within the hospital complex for testing rather than similar facilities and equipment outside, the physician is nevertheless free to interpret the results of such tests and free to diagnose and prescribe treatment for all the physician's patients.

        - Whether the hospital authority authorized the purchase of the hospital without considering, among other factors, the anticompetitive adverse effect of the acquisition on healthcare in the community and alternatives to leasing the hospital to the defendants were irrelevant. The state put the ultimate say-so for the provision and management of healthcare in the hands of the healthcare authorities. FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health Sys., 793 F.

Such proceeds in that fund may be invested in the same way that public moneys may be invested generally pursuant to general law and as permitted under Code Section 31-7-83, but money in that trust fund shall be used exclusively for funding the provision of health care for the indigent residents of the political subdivision which owned the hospital or by which the authority was activated or for which the authority was created. If the funds available for a political subdivision in that irrevocable trust fund are less than $100,000.00, the principal amount may be used to fund the provision of indigent health care; otherwise, only the income from that fund may be used for that care. Such funding or reimbursement for indigent care shall not exceed the diagnosis related group rate for that hospital in each individual case.

       The General Assembly declares that it is the intent of this article to provide a mechanism for the operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the several counties and municipalities of this state. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that, whenever an authority ceases to perform the minimum functions required for the continued operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the county or municipality, a procedure be made available to recognize the failure of the authority to perform these minimum functions and to provide for the orderly and responsible reorganization of the authority.

       Whenever it appears that an authority has ceased to perform the minimum functions required for the continued operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the county or municipality in which the authority is authorized to function, a petition may be filed in the superior court in the county requesting that the members of the authority be removed from office and that any vacancy created by a removal be filled as provided in Code Section 31-7-72 for the initial appointment of members of an authority. Each such petition shall be filed by one or more residents of the county in which the authority is authorized to function, or by the county governing authority, and shall be supported by petition of a number of residents of the county equal to 5 percent or more of the number of electors registered to vote in the general election last held in the county. In the case of an authority authorized to function solely within a municipality, the petition shall be filed by one or more residents of the municipality in which the authority is authorized to function, or by the municipal governing authority, and shall be supported by petition of a number of residents of the municipality equal to 5 percent or more of the number of electors registered to vote in the general election last held in the municipality.

       Upon the filing of any petition as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, the judge of the superior court shall set a hearing to inquire into the merits of the petition not sooner than ten days nor later than 30 days from the date of filing of the petition.

In making his determination the judge shall consider, but shall not be limited by, whether the authority has:

      Obligations of an authority evidenced by certificates and trust indentures and mortgages executed in connection therewith may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by the authority. The authority may in such instruments provide for pledging of all or any part of its gross or net fees, tolls, charges, revenues, and incomes and for mortgaging of all or any part of its real or personal property and may covenant against pledging any or all of its income, revenues, tolls, charges, or fees; and the authority may further provide for the disposition of proceeds realized from the sale of any mutilated certificates and necessary provisions as to payment and redemption of such certificates. Undertakings of an authority may likewise prescribe the procedure by which certificate holders may enforce rights against the authority and provide for such rights upon breach of any covenant, condition, or obligation of the authority. Trust indentures, mortgages, or deeds to secure debt executed by an authority may provide that, in the event of default by the authority in the payment of principal and interest on certificates or obligations or breach of any covenant, a trustee or trustees appointed under the terms of the indenture, mortgage, or deed to secure debt, which shall be a bank or trust company authorized to exercise trust powers, may take possession of and use, operate, and manage any project mortgaged as security for the repayment of any indebtedness of the authority and provide the terms and conditions upon which the trustee or trustees or holders of certificates may enforce any right relating to such certificates. Such trust indentures, mortgages, and deeds to secure debt may contain such provisions, not inconsistent with law, as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the authority.

       The General Assembly finds that hospital authorities and rural hospital organizations are essential in order to promote public health goals of the state. The General Assembly further finds that many rural hospital organizations are in desperate financial straits. In order to preserve the availability of primary health care services provided by such hospitals to residents of rural counties, the General Assembly has determined that a program of state grants is necessary and recommends funds be made available to such hospitals. These grants will be conditioned upon those hospitals continuing to furnish essential health care services to residents in their areas of operation as well as engaging in the long-range planning and any restructuring which may be required for those hospitals to survive by devising cost-effective and efficient health care systems for meeting local health care needs.

         There exists in this state a seriously inadequate supply of and a critical need for facilities which can furnish the comprehensive services required by elderly persons in a single location, including, without limitation, residential care and the types of services provided in skilled nursing homes, intermediate care homes, assisted living communities, and personal care homes (hereinafter referred to as "residential care facilities for the elderly");

         An adequate supply of residential care facilities for the elderly to provide the special facilities and services needed by elderly persons cannot be provided through the ordinary operation of private enterprise, and therefore the involvement of a public agency, as is contemplated in this article, in such an undertaking would not be competitive with private enterprise.

          Accordingly, it is determined that it is a valid public purpose, as a matter of public health, safety, convenience, and welfare, to assist in providing residential care facilities for the elderly.

        is apparently to afford hospitals and similar institutions rendering medical care to examine, in the first instance, the propriety of procedures used within their institutions, in order to take curative action to remedy questionable procedures or to prevent stigmatization of certain physicians under investigation that would necessarily follow from disclosure of such proceedings, whether the medical review committee's (now organization's) disposition is favorable or unfavorable to the physician under investigation, and injury to hospital's ability to make in-house examination of adequacy of treatment afforded its patients is sufficiently great to warrant its confidentiality. Scott v. McDonald, 70 F.R.D. 568 (N.D. Ga. 1976).

       </h5>
       <p>
        - Georgia law did not allow for a self-critical analysis privilege; the fact that the peer review privilege is limited to review organizations within the healthcare field weighs heavily against extending such privilege to a corporate organization.

        - This section does not immunize production of documents from original sources that might have fortuitously been considered during hearing, nor does the statute prevent some participant from medical review proceedings from giving testimony as to matters within the participant's knowledge or as to an applicable standard of care; it merely prohibits requiring a member of the committee (now organization) to testify as to what the member or another person might have said during the course of proceedings.

The interests of the people of this state demand that all appropriate resources, including inpatient facilities, be available to assist in the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and amelioration of psychological problems and emotional and mental disorders. The General Assembly recognizes that psychology is an independent health profession as set forth and prescribed by the State Board of Examiners of Psychologists and Chapter 39 of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.

      The purpose of the public hearing shall be to ensure that the public's interest is protected when the assets of a nonprofit hospital are acquired by an acquiring entity by requiring full disclosure of the purpose and terms of the transaction and providing an opportunity for local public input. The disposition of a nonprofit hospital to an acquiring entity shall not be in the public interest unless there has been adequate disclosure that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that the transaction is authorized, to safeguard the value of charitable assets, and to ensure that any proceeds of the transaction are used for appropriate charitable health care purposes. Such disclosure shall address, at a minimum, the following factors:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c07s31-7-406ol11">

       The procedures used by the nonprofit corporation in making its decision to dispose of its assets, including whether appropriate expert assistance was used;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c07s31-7-406ol15">
       Whether any conflict of interest was disclosed, including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest related to directors or officers of the nonprofit corporation and experts retained by the parties to the transaction;

      In order to promote and preserve the health of the people of this state, there is established a Hospital Care for the Indigent Program to be administered by the Department of Community Health. The purpose of this program is to assist counties in the purchase of hospital care for persons who are ill or injured and who can be helped by treatment in a hospital but are financially unable to meet the full cost of hospital care from their own resources or from the resources of those upon whom they are legally dependent. The purchase of such hospital care shall be limited to the nonprofit basic cost of hospital care needed for the treatment of the ill or injured, as deemed necessary and ordered by the physician in charge of the case in accordance with this article and the rules, regulations, and standards adopted and promulgated pursuant to this article.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that there is an inequitable distribution of the public costs incurred in providing health care for indigent persons who receive such care outside their counties of residence. The publicly supported hospitals providing such health care are frequently not reimbursed for the costs thereby incurred, which either increases the tax burden of citizens supporting such hospitals or increases the charges made to paying patients or causes a combination of both types of such increases. It is the purpose of this article to recognize and provide for the state's responsibility to assist in the payment of cost of care for nonresident indigent patients by providing procedures for the reimbursement of such costs from state funds.

      The General Assembly finds that Georgia's high rates of infant mortality and morbidity are costly to the state in terms of human suffering and of expenditures for long-term institutionalization, special education, and medical care. It is well documented that appropriate care during pregnancy and delivery can prevent many of the expensive, disabling problems our children experience. The State of Georgia is making progress in improving services and funding. However, the General Assembly is concerned that some women continue to be refused service for financial reasons at hospitals when they request admission after labor has begun. It is the purpose of this article to assure that:

       The commissioner of community health shall adopt state-wide standards to determine indigency for the purposes of this article, which standards shall be based upon and consistent with 125 percent of the federal poverty level as it exists on May 1, 1985. These standards shall further provide for legal liability, based upon ability to pay some reasonable percentage of cost of care, for patients and other persons legally liable for the patients' cost of care if those patients or other persons do not meet the indigency standards based upon less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level but do meet those standards based upon between 100 and 125 percent of the federal poverty level, as such level exists on May 1, 1985.

       Within 30 days after receiving the standards provided by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section, the governing authority of each county, by resolution, shall designate a person, to be known as the health care advisory officer of the county, to make a determination of indigency for the residents of the county in accordance with the standards promulgated pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section. The health care advisory officer shall carry out such additional duties as may be assigned to him by the governing authority of the county. It shall be the duty of the governing authority of each county to mail a copy of such resolution to the commissioner or the commissioner's designee within 15 days after its adoption. The governing authority of any county may change the person designated as the health care advisory officer, but any such change shall be accomplished by resolution of the governing authority, and a copy of the resolution making such change shall be mailed to the commissioner or the commissioner's designee within 15 days after its adoption. If a county fails or refuses either to designate a health care advisory officer or to provide to the commissioner or the commissioner's designee the required notification of the county's designation of such officer, the county governing authority shall be deemed to be such officer for purposes of this article.

Such notification shall include a certification by the chief administrative officer of the hospital that an appropriate investigation has been made and that it has been determined that no portion of the cost of services may be paid by the medical assistance program for the needy under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, by insurance, or by any other governmental or public agency pursuant to any federal, state, or local program or a certification that an appropriate investigation has been made and that a portion of the cost of services may be paid from such sources. If it is determined that a portion of the cost of services may be paid from such sources, then the notification shall include a certification of the amount which may be so paid. Such notification shall also request a determination of indigency of the patient. As soon as practicable after receiving such notification but not later than 60 days thereafter, the health care advisory officer of the county shall notify the chief administrative officer of the hospital of his determination. If the health care advisory officer determines that the patient meets the indigency standards or if the health care advisory officer of a county fails to respond to a request for a determination of indigency from a hospital providing health care for such patient within the time limitation provided by this subsection, the county of residence of the patient shall be liable for the payment of cost of care of such patient in each hospital rendering the emergency services. In such event, each hospital and physician providing the emergency health care for the patient may bill the county of residence of the patient for the amount of the patient's cost of care. It shall be the duty of the governing authority of such county to pay the hospital and physician that billed amount plus, if that billed amount is not paid by the county within 120 days after the mailing of a request for a determination of indigency, interest on the billed amount at the rate specified in Code Section 48-2-40 for unpaid taxes.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that a significant number of older citizens of this state reside in long-term care facilities in this state and, because of their isolated and vulnerable condition, are more dependent on others for their protection and care. It is the intent of the General Assembly to protect and improve the quality of care and life for residents through the promotion of community involvement in long-term care facilities and by the establishment of a process to resolve complaints and problems of residents. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that the department, within available resources and pursuant to its duties under the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, ensure that the quality of care and life for such residents is maintained, that necessary reports are made and that, where necessary, corrective action is taken at the departmental level.

The state ombudsman may certify community ombudsmen and such certified ombudsmen shall have the powers and duties set forth in Code Sections 31-8-54 and 31-8-55. The state ombudsman shall require such community ombudsmen to receive appropriate training as determined and approved by the department prior to certification. Such training shall include an internship of at least seven working days in a nursing home and at least three working days in a personal care home. Upon certification, the state ombudsman shall issue an identification card which shall be presented upon request by community ombudsmen whenever needed to carry out the purposes of this article. Two years after first being certified and every two years thereafter, each such community ombudsman, in order to carry out his or her duties under this article, shall be recertified by the state ombudsman as continuing to meet the department's standards as community ombudsman.

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that persons residing within long-term care facilities are isolated from the community and often lack the means to assert fully their rights as individual citizens. The General Assembly further recognizes the need for these persons to live within the least restrictive environment possible in order to retain their individuality and personal freedom. It is therefore the intent of the General Assembly to preserve the dignity and personal integrity of residents of long-term care facilities through the recognition and declaration of rights safeguarding against encroachments upon each resident's need for self-determination. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that this article complement and not duplicate or substitute for other survey and inspection programs regarding long-term care facilities.

       Restriction to a designated area
      
      is a restraint on mobility of the resident and in effect isolates the resident. This is prohibited. A restriction from an area where friction between the residents tends to develop, i.e., the TV room, exercise room, or even the dining room, may be used by management as necessary as an aid in behavioral control, since it does not isolate or restrain the mobility of the resident from other areas of the grounds and is not a form of physical restraint.

The notice of the discharge by the resident or guardian, the expected and actual date thereof, and notice to the department, where required, shall be documented in the resident's records.

      The General Assembly finds that persons residing within personal care homes are often isolated from the community and often lack the means to assert fully their rights as individual citizens.The General Assembly also recognizes that in order for the rights of residents of personal care homes to be fully protected, residents must be afforded a means of recourse when such rights have been denied.It is therefore the intent of the General Assembly to preserve the dignity and personal integrity of residents of personal care homes by providing access to a legal process to hear and redress the grievances of such residents regarding their individual rights.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that a significant proportion of the residents of this state who are uninsured or Medicaid recipients are unable to access needed health care because health care providers fear the increased risk of medical negligence liability. It is the intent of the General Assembly that access to medical care for indigent residents be improved by providing governmental protection to health care providers who offer free quality medical services to underserved populations of the state. Therefore, it is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that health care professionals who contract to provide such services as agents of the state are provided sovereign immunity.

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

       - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a medical center and denying it to a patient's parent because the parent signed the form on behalf of the adult son as an agent, not in a personal capacity; thus, the parent was not personally liable for any unpaid medical bills.

        <p>
       - Patient's complaint could be read to adequately plead claims for fraud, battery, and negligent misrepresentation by alleging that the doctor failed to inform the patient of the doctor's known disabilities prior to the surgery; the known physical limitations caused the doctor to perform the surgery in a deficient manner; and the patient experienced complications as a direct result of the surgery. Holmes v. Lyons, <cite class="ga_app_court">346 Ga. App. 99</cite>, <cite class="app_court">815 S.E.2d 252</cite> (2018).

        Disclosure of general course of treatment to patient precludes any action based on lack of consent

       Since appellant signed a consent form authorizing surgery, and the record clearly established that appellant understood the general course of proposed treatment, the appellant was precluded from maintaining an action alleging that defendant/physician breached the physician's duty in failing to warn of risks of treatment or that appellant's consent was thereby rendered invalid absent a showing of fraudulent misrepresentations of material fact.

        <p>
       - If the consent form is inadequate, or if there is no written consent shown, summary judgment for physician may be obtained by establishing that plaintiff-patient knew, from any source, the general course of treatment to be undertaken.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When language in a consent form was ambiguous as to whether consent was given only to additional procedures which were both necessary and appropriate or which were either necessary or appropriate, and, whether if two different classes of additional procedures existed, within which class the procedure performed on plaintiff existed, because of the inequality of the bargaining position between defendant physicians and plaintiff, the ambiguity was construed against the defendants as encompassing only additional procedures which were both necessary and appropriate when rendered.

       - Patient's consent to a general course of treatment does not preclude an action for battery for the treatment actually undertaken.

Accordingly, a doctor was not liable for failing to inform a heart patient of a relatively unknown therapy treatment as an alternative to open heart surgery. Moore v.

       While breach of the statute's requirements may support a cause of action under the medical malpractice statutes, the statute presupposes that one of the identified procedures was performed.

        <p>
       Even if the informed consent statute applied to the patient's action against the dentist for damage the dentist allegedly caused when the dentist gave the patient an injection to numb pain, as the patient requested, the statute explicitly provided that violation of the statute did not give rise to a separate cause of action, but instead may give rise to a medical malpractice action; accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting partial summary judgment to the dentist on the patient's allegation that the informed consent statute was violated.
   Additionally, the injection was neither a surgical procedure nor one of the diagnostic procedures specified in the statute regarding the situations in which a healthcare provider had to obtain a patient's informed consent. Pope v. Davis, <cite class="ga_app_court">261 Ga. App. 308</cite>, <cite class="app_court">582 S.E.2d 460</cite> (2003).

      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) In the founding of the United States of America, the State of Georgia and the several states affirmed that: 'We hold these Truths to be self evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness -
   that to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among men;'

      <p>
       "(2) To protect the fundamental rights of all persons, and specifically to protect the fundamental rights of particular classes of persons who had not previously been recognized under law, the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, providing that, 'nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws';
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) Modern medical science, not available decades ago, demonstrates that unborn children are a class of living, distinct persons and more expansive state recognition of unborn children as persons did not exist when
       <i>
        Planned Parenthood v. Casey
       </i>
       (1992) and

       </i>
       (1973) established abortion related precedents;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) The State of Georgia, applying reasoned judgment to the full body of modern medical science, recognizes the benefits of providing full legal recognition to an unborn child above the minimum requirements of federal law;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5) Article I, Section I, Paragraphs I and II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia affirm that '[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property except by due process of law'; and that '[p]rotection to person and property is the paramount duty of government and shall be impartial and complete.
   No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws'; and
      </p>
      <p>

     <p>
      In any civil proceeding or action relating to this chapter or a breach of duty under this chapter, the court shall rule whether the anonymity of any female upon whom an abortion has been performed shall be preserved from public disclosure if she does not give her consent to such disclosure. The court, upon motion or sua sponte, shall make such a ruling and, upon determining that her anonymity should be preserved, shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel and shall direct the sealing of the record and exclusion of individuals from courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard her identity from public disclosure. Each such order shall be accompanied by specific written findings explaining why the anonymity of the female should be preserved from public disclosure, why the order is essential to that end, how the order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, and why no reasonable less restrictive alternative exists. This Code section may not be construed to conceal the identity of the plaintiff or of witnesses from the defendant.

       - Certified copy of death certificate properly filed is no longer prima facie evidence of facts stated therein, and when facts stated therein are shown to result from statements made by others, such facts amount to hearsay. Under present law a certified copy of a duly filed death certificate is allowed in evidence only for purpose for which it was intended, that is, to show that person named therein is no longer in life.

       - Death certificate is prima facie evidence of facts therein stated but presumption raised is rebuttable. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Holcombe, <cite class="ga_app_court">132 Ga. App. 111</cite>, <cite class="app_court">207 S.E.2d 537</cite> (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Death certificate serves as prima facie evidence only of death and immediate agency of death, and other conclusions, such as those regarding events leading up to death or whether cause of death was intentional or accidental, are not admissible. King v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 762</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 485</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Certified copy of death certificate properly filed is no longer prima facie evidence of facts stated therein, and when facts stated therein are shown to result from statements made by others, such facts amount to hearsay. Under present law, a certified copy of a duly filed death certificate is allowed in evidence only for the purpose for which it was intended, that is, to show that the person named therein is no longer in life. Interstate Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Wilmont, <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga. App. 337</cite>, <cite class="app_court">180 S.E.2d 913</cite> (1971), criticized in Allstate Ins. Co. v.

        <p>

        Certified copy of birth certificate shall be prima facie evidence
       
       only of facts therein contained and such evidence may be rebutted. It was therefore competent for the state to introduce a birth certificate to prove that a witness was under 14 years of age, and to further prove by parol evidence that the record contained an error as to the witness' race and that of the witness' parents. Cunningham v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">85 Ga. App. 216</cite>, <cite class="app_court">68 S.E.2d 614</cite> (1952).

       - Under rule of strict construction that must be applied to this section, a death certificate is not admissible to prove particular matters stated in the certificate: (1) if the statement is based on hearsay and not upon personal knowledge of a physician or official completing certificate; or (2) if the statement is one of opinion to which a physician or official would not be qualified to testify personally. In these instances, statements contained in the certificate are not statements of fact within the meaning of the statute and an exception to the hearsay rule is inapplicable. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins.

       The Board of Public Health shall have the authority on behalf of the state to designate and contract with a public or nonprofit local entity to coordinate and administer the EMSC Program for each health district designated by the Department of Public Health. The local coordinating entity thus designated shall be responsible for recommending to the board or its designee the manner in which the EMSC Program is to be conducted. In making its recommendations, the local coordinating entity shall give priority to making the EMSC Program function as efficiently and economically as possible. Each licensed ambulance provider in the health district shall have the opportunity to participate in the EMSC Program.

       The local coordinating entity shall request from each licensed ambulance provider in its health district a written description of the territory in which it can respond to emergency calls, based upon the provider's average response time from its base location within such territory; and such written description shall be due within ten days of the request by the local coordinating entity.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-3ol1c">
       After receipt of the written descriptions of territory in which the ambulance providers propose to respond to emergency calls, the local coordinating entity shall within ten days recommend in writing to the board or its designee the territories within the health district to be serviced by the ambulance providers; and at this same time the local coordinating entity shall also recommend the method for distributing emergency calls among the providers, based primarily on the considerations of economy, efficiency, and benefit to the public welfare. The recommendation of the local coordinating entity shall be forwarded immediately to the board or its designee for approval or modification of the territorial zones and method of distributing calls among ambulance providers participating in the EMSC Program in the health district.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-3ol1d">
       The board, or its designee, is empowered to conduct a hearing into the recommendations made by the local coordinating entity, and such hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in Code Section 31-5-2.

       The recommendations of the local coordinating entity shall not be modified unless the board or its designee shall find, after a hearing, that the determination of the district health director is not consistent with operation of the EMSC Program in an efficient, economical manner that benefits the public welfare. The decision of the board or its designee shall be rendered as soon as possible and shall be final and conclusive concerning the operation of the EMSC Program; and appeal from such decision shall be pursuant to Code Section 31-5-3.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the decision by the designee of the Board of Human Resources to exclude licensed private ambulance service from automatic routing of emergency calls took numerous factors into account and based the board's decision upon hotly contested facts, there were genuine issues of material fact and the trial court erred in awarding summary judgment against the designee.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t31c11s31-11-3" target="_self">31-11-3</a></cite> is phrased as a mandatory directive to the designee, the statute does not purport to confine the designee to the same limited standard of review to which the judiciary is confined respecting administrative decisions, nor does the statute overcome the constitutional proscription against plenary judicial review of such decisions. DeKalb County v. Metro Ambulance Servs., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">253 Ga. 561</cite>, <cite class="app_court">322 S.E.2d 881</cite> (1984).

       the specific factual inquiry made by the Board of Human Resources' designee concerning the double burden of citizens' funding local emergency medical services as well as paying private ambulance service's fees fell within the board's discretion to take into consideration the factors of economy and efficiency so as to benefit local citizens.

        Term "shall have an opportunity to participate"
       
       should be construed in pari materia with the mandatory statutory criteria of efficiency, economy, and public welfare, and the extent of a private ambulance service's participation in the automatic funneling of emergency calls is contingent upon the Board of Human Resources designee's discretionary determination of how best to fulfill the statutory criteria.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t31c11s31-11-8" target="_self">31-11-8</a></cite> provided immunity against liability for the paramedics' conduct. Thomas v. DeKalb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">227 Ga. App. 186</cite>, <cite class="app_court">489 S.E.2d 58</cite> (1997).

       Since plaintiff presented no evidence that defendants, emergency medical technicians, believed the defendant's conduct was unconscionable or that the circumstances required further investigation, even if the defendants exercised bad judgment and acted negligently, such conduct did not amount to a lack of good faith and, accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the defendants.

       Paramedic was an employee of the county emergency medical services, which was licensed to provide ambulance services and the administratrix did not present any evidence suggesting that defendants did not act in good faith; viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the administratrix, the evidence showed, at best, that the defendants exercised bad judgment and acted negligently in caring for the decedent but this was not enough to show a lack of good faith for purposes of statutory immunity.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol11">
       The rapid identification, diagnosis, and treatment of stroke can save the lives of stroke patients and in some cases can reverse neurological damage such as paralysis and speech and language impairments, leaving stroke patients with few or no neurological deficits;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol12">
       Despite significant advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and the number one cause of disability in this country; an estimated 800,000 new and recurrent strokes occur each year in this country, and with the aging of the population, the number of persons who have strokes is projected to increase;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol13">
       Although new treatments are available to improve the clinical outcomes of stroke, many acute care hospitals often face challenges in obtaining staff and equipment required to optimally triage and treat stroke patients, including the provision of optimal, safe, and effective emergency care for these patients;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol14">
       Although the Georgia Coverdell Acute Stroke Registry currently exists within the Department of Public Health as a program whose purpose is to increase improvement of the quality of acute stroke care through collaborative efforts with participating hospitals in this state, less than one-third of Georgia's hospitals are currently enrolled in the program. Therefore, increased participation in and funding of this program in conjunction with the adherence to the tenets of this article would have profound effects on the quality of care for acute stroke patients in this state;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol15">
       An effective system to support stroke survival is needed in our communities in order to treat stroke patients in a timely manner and to improve the overall treatment of stroke patients in order to increase survival and decrease the disabilities associated with stroke. There is a public health need for acute care hospitals in this state to establish stroke centers to ensure the rapid triage, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of patients suffering a stroke;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol16">
       At least three levels of stroke centers should be established for the treatment of acute stroke:
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol16A">
         Comprehensive stroke centers should be established in hospitals to provide complete and specialized care to patients who experience the most complex strokes, which require specialized testing, highly technical procedures, and other interventions, and to provide education and guidance to primary and remote treatment stroke centers;
        </li>
        <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol16B">
         Primary stroke centers should be established in as many acute care hospitals as possible to evaluate, stabilize, and provide or arrange for treatment, care, and rehabilitative services to patients diagnosed with acute stroke; and
        </li>
        <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol16C">
         Remote treatment stroke centers should be established to evaluate, stabilize, and provide treatment to patients diagnosed with acute stroke in rural and other underserved areas of the state, because access to stroke care is limited in these areas due to the limited availability of professional specialists, high-tech imaging equipment, and transportation services;
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol17">
       Coordination between stroke centers should be encouraged through the establishment of coordinated stroke care agreements; and
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-110ol18">
       Therefore, it is in the best interest of the residents of this state to establish a program to identify certified stroke centers throughout the state, to provide specific patient care and support services criteria that stroke centers must meet in order to ensure that stroke patients receive safe and effective care, and to provide financial support to acute care hospitals to encourage them to develop stroke centers in all areas of the state. Further, it is in the best interest of the people of this state to modify the state's emergency medical response system to assure that stroke patients may be quickly identified and transported to and treated in facilities that have specialized programs for providing timely and effective treatment for stroke patients.

      The General Assembly finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-130ol11">
       Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and in Georgia;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-130ol12">
       Georgia ranks as the thirty-eighth worst in the nation for numbers of deaths from cardiovascular disease;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-130ol13">
       There were 79,901 deaths in Georgia in 2015, and cardiovascular disease (excluding stroke) accounted for 23.6 percent of such deaths;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-130ol14">
       Approximately 40 percent of cardiac deaths occur suddenly, the result of a heart attack that is manifested by an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-130ol15">
       As of 2016, several states, but notably Arizona and Washington, have designated hospitals that are expert in cardiovascular disease care, much in the way that Georgia has stroke and trauma centers; Arizona and Washington have some of the lowest death rates for patients who have heart attacks, in part due to their designated cardiac centers; and
      </li>
      <li id="t31c11s31-11-130ol16">
       Therefore, it is in the best interest of the residents of this state to establish a program to identify emergency cardiac care centers throughout the state to ensure the rapid triage, assessment, treatment, and transport of patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or heart attack or its complications.

       The Georgia General Assembly makes the following findings: The attacks of September and October, 2001, on the United States have heightened concerns that terrorists may have access to the smallpox virus and may attempt to use it against the American public. In light of these concerns, and in order to secure public health and national security, the United States government has launched, and the State of Georgia has cooperated in, a smallpox vaccination and treatment program, with a recommendation for initial smallpox vaccinations for certain hospitals, health care workers, and emergency response workers. However, due to the virulent nature of smallpox and its vaccine, participation by hospitals and health care workers in such a program potentially increases their exposure to liability that, without sufficient legal protections, may significantly discourage their participation in the program. The federal government has determined, and the General Assembly agrees, that liability protection for those hospitals and health care workers who participate in such programs are integral to ensuring its maximum success. Accordingly, to achieve a potent and widespread smallpox vaccination and treatment program and maintain an effective defense against possible terrorist attacks, it is critical that hospitals and health care workers participating in such program be protected from potential legal liability absent their gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. The General Assembly therefore concludes that certain steps must be taken to encourage participation in the smallpox vaccination and treatment program in order to reserve to Georgia citizens continued access to smallpox vaccination and treatment services in the event of a terrorist attack.

       - Trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss or the motion for summary judgment filed by various defendants in a suit brought by plaintiff child, by and through the child's parent, which asserted negligence and negligence per se for failing to inform the plaintiff and the parent, at the time of the plaintiff's birth, that the plaintiff had sickle cell disease. The trial court properly ruled that no private right of action exists for violation of O.C.G.A.
   §

       Immediately upon the filing of a petition pursuant to Code Section 31-14-2, the judge of the superior court shall set the matter for a full and fair hearing on the petition. Such hearing shall be held no sooner than seven days and no later than 12 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, subsequent to the time of filing of the petition. The court shall serve personal notice of the hearing upon the person named in the petition and upon the petitioner. The notice required by this Code section shall include the time and place of the hearing; notice of the person's right to counsel, that the person may apply for court appointed counsel if the person cannot afford counsel, and that the court will appoint counsel unless the person indicates in writing that he or she does not wish to be represented by counsel; and notice that the person may waive his or her rights to a hearing under this Code section. A copy of the petition and physician's certificate filed under Code Section 31-14-2 shall be attached to the notice. The judge shall, where prayed for in the petition, provide for the examination of the person named therein by a physician licensed under Chapter 34 of Title 43, which examination shall include sputum examinations by a laboratory approved by the department and a recent chest X-ray of good diagnostic quality interpreted by a physician licensed to practice under Chapter 34 of Title 43, as a part of the order setting the matter for hearing; the order shall require the person or persons named therein to make such examination. Any X-ray and accompanying report or any written report as to a sputum examination shall be admissible as evidence without the necessity of the personal testimony of the person or persons making such examination and report. A physician may rely upon this evidence as the basis for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis and the defendant may offer opposing evidence on this issue by testimony or otherwise. All court costs incurred in proceedings under this chapter, including costs of examinations required by order of court but excluding any examinations procured by the person named in the petition, shall be borne by the county wherein the proceedings are brought. The fee to be paid to an attorney appointed under this Code section to represent a person who cannot afford counsel shall be paid by the county board of health instituting proceedings for commitment.

       A full and fair hearing shall mean a proceeding before a hearing examiner under Code Section 31-14-8.1 or before the superior court in a proceeding under subsection (a) of this Code section. The hearing may be held in a regular court room or in an informal setting, in the discretion of the hearing examiner or the court, but the hearing shall be recorded electronically or by a qualified court reporter. The person named as defendant shall be provided with the opportunity for the assistance of counsel. If the defendant cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the defendant or the hearing examiner shall request that the court appoint such counsel; provided, however, that the defendant shall have the right to refuse in writing appointment of counsel. Both parties shall have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, to offer evidence, and to subpoena witnesses. Both parties shall have the right to require testimony before the hearing examiner or in court in person or by deposition from any physician upon whose evaluation the decision of the hearing examiner or the court may rest. The hearing examiner and the court shall apply the rules of evidence applicable in civil cases, except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. The burden of proof shall be upon the party seeking commitment of the defendant. The standard of proof shall be by clear and convincing evidence. At the request of the defendant, the public may be excluded from the hearing. The defendant may waive his or her right to be present at the hearing. The reason for the action of the court or the hearing examiner in excluding the public or permitting the hearing to proceed in the defendant's absence shall be reflected in the record.

   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that:
   "(1) Osteoporosis affects 28 million Americans and each year results in 1.5 million fractures of the hip, spine, wrist, and other bones, costing the nation $14 billion annually; (2) Osteoporosis progresses silently, in many cases undiagnosed until a fracture occurs, and once a fracture occurs, the disease is already advanced, and the likelihood is high that another fracture will occur; (3) One in two women and one in eight men 50 years of age and over will suffer a fracture due to osteoporosis; (4) Since osteoporosis progresses silently and currently has no cure, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment are key to reducing the prevalence and devastation of this disease; (5) Medical experts agree that osteoporosis is preventable and treatable; however, once the disease progresses to the point of fracture, its associated consequences may lead to disability and institutionalization and may exact a heavy toll on quality of life; (6) Given the current focus on reducing unnecessary health care expenditures through the use of health promotion and disease prevention programs, it is cost effective to make available coverage of services such as bone mass measurement, which will lead to early diagnosis, prevention of fracture, and timely treatment of osteoporosis; (7) Bone mass measurement is a reliable way to detect the presence of low bone mass and to ascertain the extent of bone loss to help assess the individual's risk for fracture, which aids in selecting appropriate therapies and interventions, while ordinary X-rays are not sensitive enough to detect osteoporosis until 25-40 percent of bone mass has been lost and the disease is advanced; (8) Current available technologies for measuring bone mass or bone loss include single and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, computed tomography, radiographic absorptiometry, and biochemical markers, and other technologies for determining bone mass or bone loss are under investigation and may become scientifically proven technologies in the future; and (9) Scientifically proven technologies for detecting bone loss and other services related to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis can be used effectively to reduce the pain and financial burden that osteoporosis inflicts upon its victims."

       It is declared and found that one of the most serious and tragic problems facing the public health and welfare is the death of hundreds of persons in this state every year from chronic renal disease, although the present state of medical arts and technology could return these persons to a socially productive life. Advances and discoveries in the treatment of patients suffering from chronic renal disease now allow not mere survival but rehabilitation of these patients to their normal occupations and activities. Presently, these patients are dying for lack of personal financial resources to pay for the expensive equipment and care which they need.

It is believed that these programs will, by making treatment of chronic renal disease easily available, steadily lower the cost of such treatment.

   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that:
   "The General Assembly finds that chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease which may cause serious complications in persons infected with it, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.
   Pregnant women infected with chlamydia may suffer from symptoms such as stillbirths, low birth weight babies, and other serious physical and mental complications for their infants.
   Chlamydia is often asymptomatic in women and cannot be detected except with special, though inexpensive, screening tests.
   Cure of chlamydia is usually both easy and inexpensive.
   The General Assembly further finds that requiring health care insurance and managed care plan coverage of annual chlamydia screening tests for females in the age group most likely to be infected with chlamydia will encourage the testing and treatment needed to detect and cure this destructive disease and result in a marked improvement in the general health of the citizens of this state and the savings of both public and private moneys being spent to deal with the serious consequences of this disease."

   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its causative agent, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), pose a grave threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. In the absence of any effective vaccination or treatment for this disease, it threatens almost certain death to all who contract it. The disease is largely transmitted through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use, not through casual contact, and, while deadly, is therefore preventable. The key component of the fight against AIDS is education. Through public education and counseling our citizens can learn how the disease is transmitted and, thus, how to protect themselves and prevent its spread. The Department of Human Resources is encouraged to continue its efforts to educate all Georgians about the disease, its causative agent, and its means of transmission. In addition, voluntary testing should be encouraged for anyone who feels at risk of infection. While education, counseling, and voluntary testing are vital to the elimination of this epidemic, other measures are needed to protect the health of our citizens, and it is the intention of the General Assembly to enact such measures in the exercise of its police powers in order to deal with AIDS and HIV infection."

       Declaration of policy. The General Assembly finds that the present laws of this state provide no means for the performance of sterilization procedures upon persons who, because of a developmental disability, brain damage, or both, are irreversibly and incurably mentally incompetent to the degree that such persons, with or without economic aid (charitable or otherwise) from others, could not provide care and support for any children procreated by them in such a way that such children could reasonably be expected to survive to the age of 18 years without suffering or sustaining serious mental or physical harm.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c20s31-20-3ol1b">
       Definitions. As used in this Code section, the term "person subject to this Code section" means a person who, because of a developmental disability, brain damage, or both, is irreversibly and incurably mentally incompetent to the degree that such person, with or without economic aid (charitable or otherwise) from others, could not provide care and support for any children procreated by such person in such a way that such children could reasonably be expected to survive to the age of 18 years without suffering or sustaining serious mental or physical harm, when there has been, according to the procedures of this Code section as hereinafter stated, the required finding that the condition of such person is irreversible and incurable.

      <li id="t31c20s31-20-3ol1c">
       Prerequisites to performing a sterilization procedure on a person subject to this Code section. A sterilization procedure may be performed by a physician on a person subject to this Code section pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section only after satisfaction of all of the following conditions precedent:
       <ol>
        <li id="t31c20s31-20-3ol1c1">
         A petition shall be filed by one or more of the parents or legal guardian or next of kin of the person alleged to be subject to this Code section stating the reasons why such person is alleged to be subject to this Code section and containing the written consent of the parent or parents not filing the petition, if such parents are surviving, can be found after reasonable effort, and are mentally competent. If no such parent or parents survive or can be found after reasonable effort or if such parent or parents are mentally incompetent, the petition shall contain the written consent of a guardian ad litem who shall be appointed by the probate court and who shall make investigation and report to such court before the hearing shall commence, provided that such guardian ad litem shall be a duly qualified and licensed member of the State Bar of Georgia. The written consent of any parent shall not be required if such parent has not within six months of the date of filing of the petition provided any support or maintenance to the person alleged to be subject to this Code section and such parent does not reside within the same household as such person;

         The judge of the probate court shall appoint an examining team composed of a psychologist or psychiatrist qualified in the area of developmental disabilities and brain damage and one physician, neither of whom is the physician who proposes to perform the sterilization procedure on the person alleged to be subject to this Code section and neither of whom is a member of the committee of the accredited hospital described in paragraph (3) of this subsection. Said persons so appointed shall make an investigation and make a consolidated report to the court before the hearing shall commence that they have examined the person alleged to be subject to this Code section and whether or not they find such person to be a person subject to this Code section and whether, in their opinion, the condition of such person is irreversible and incurable. Such report shall include the reasons and factual information as to why such person should be subject to this Code section and the reasons, if any, why such person would not be subject to this Code section. If the examining team determines that such person is subject to this Code section, then the team shall include in its report some of the less permanent methods of preventing conception and shall report on the feasibility of each such method for that person. The person alleged to be subject to this Code section, the applicant, the parents of the person, the guardian ad litem, and the attorney representing the person shall receive a copy of the report not later than five days prior to the hearing and, upon a timely request by any party to the probate court proceedings, each author of that report shall be subject to cross-examination either by testimony in court or by deposition;

         Prior to the hearing on the application, evidence shall be presented to the court that a sterilization procedure has been approved for the person alleged to be subject to this Code section by a committee of the medical staff of the accredited hospital in which the operation is to be performed. Such committee shall be one established and maintained in accordance with the standards promulgated by a nationally recognized health care accreditation body, and its approval must be by a majority vote of a membership of not less than three members of the hospital staff, the physician proposing to perform the sterilization procedure not being counted as a member of the committee for this purpose. The approval of such committee as above specified shall be based upon a finding that the condition of the person alleged to be subject to this Code section is irreversible and incurable in the opinion of the majority of the committee as above specified. The person alleged to be subject to this Code section, the applicant, the parents of the person, the guardian ad litem, and the attorney representing the person shall receive a copy of the consolidated report not later than five days prior to the hearing and, upon a timely request by any party to the probate court proceeding, each author of that finding shall be subject to cross-examination either by testimony in court or by deposition;

Notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing shall be provided to the person alleged to be subject to this Code section and the attorney for the person alleged to be subject to this Code section at least ten days prior to the hearing;

The proceedings before the superior court shall constitute a trial de novo and upon application of either party shall be heard before a jury. If the person alleged to be subject to this Code section requests that the trial be closed to the public, the judge shall close the trial to the public unless an overriding or compelling reason can be shown as to why such trial should not be closed to the public. The ruling by the judge whether to open the trial to the public or not shall be in writing. Any decision of the superior court in such cases may be appealed to the higher courts of this state as in other civil cases. The cost of appeal, if any, to the superior and higher courts shall be taxed as in other civil cases. The pendency of any appeal shall stay the proceedings in the probate court until the appeal is finally determined. Affidavits in forma pauperis regarding court costs and costs of appeal may be filed as in other cases made and provided by the laws of this state; and

   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides:
   "The General Assembly finds that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its causative agent, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), pose a grave threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state.
   In the absence of any effective vaccination or treatment for this disease, it threatens almost certain death to all who contract it.
   The disease is largely transmitted through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use, not through casual contact, and, while deadly, is therefore preventable. The key component of the fight against AIDS is education. Through public education and counseling our citizens can learn how the disease is transmitted and, thus, how to protect themselves and prevent its spread.
   The Department of Human Resources is encouraged to continue its efforts to educate all Georgians about the disease, its causative agent, and its means of transmission.
   In addition, voluntary testing should be encouraged for anyone who feels at risk of infection. While education, counseling, and voluntary testing are vital to the elimination of this epidemic, other measures are needed to protect the health of our citizens, and it is the intention of the General Assembly to enact such measures in the exercise of its police powers in order to deal with AIDS and HIV infection."

    - Requirement of the Mass Gathering Act, O.C.G.A. Ch. 27, T. 31, that a permit be obtained from the Department of Human Resources without specifying when, or even if, an application for a permit must be acted upon constitutes a prior restraint on speech in violation of the First Amendment.

     <p>
    Because the Mass Gatherings Act, O.C.G.A. Ch. 27, T. 31, fails to provide a time limit within which the Department of Human Resources (DHR) must act upon an application for a permit, the statute delegates overly broad discretion to the DHR and, therefore, constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint on the exercise of First Amendment rights.

      The person holding or promoting a mass gathering shall provide a bond of $1 million issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state. The purpose of the bond shall be to guarantee full compliance with this chapter as well as other applicable provisions of this title and the provisions of Title 12, relating to air quality control and water supply quality control, and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to cover cleanup of the site. This bond shall be in favor of the state for the benefit of any person who is damaged as a result of the activity of a mass gathering. Any person claiming against the bond may maintain an action at law against the person holding or promoting the mass gathering and the surety. In lieu of furnishing the bond, the person holding or promoting a mass gathering may deposit with the commissioner a cash deposit in like amount. However, the bond specified in this Code section shall not be required in cases where the other requirements of this chapter are met by the applicant for a permit and an incorporated municipality or county owns the area upon which the mass gathering is to be held and commits itself, in writing, to clean up the site upon which the gathering is to be held.

When, in the judgment of such board or its duly authorized agents, it is necessary and proper that such application for a permit be denied or that a permit previously granted be suspended or revoked, the applicant or holder of the permit shall be notified thereof in writing and shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing as provided in Article 1 of Chapter 5 of this title. In the event that such application is finally denied or such permit finally suspended or revoked, the applicant or holder thereof shall be given notice in writing, which notice shall specifically state the reasons why the application or permit has been suspended, revoked, or denied.

     Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

      "GEORGIA ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR HEALTH CARE
   By: ________________________________________ Date of Birth: __________________
   (Print Name)
   (Month/Day/Year)
      <i>
       This advance directive for health care has four parts:
      </i>
      PART ONE
   HEALTH CARE AGENT.
      <i>
       This part allows you to choose someone to make health care decisions for you when you cannot (or do not want to) make health care decisions for yourself.
    The person you choose is called a health care agent.
    You may also have your health care agent make decisions for you after your death with respect to an autopsy, organ donation, body donation, and final disposition of your body.
    You should talk to your health care agent about this important role
      </i>
      .
   PART TWO
   TREATMENT PREFERENCES.
      <i>
       This part allows you to state your treatment preferences if you have a terminal condition or if you are in a state of permanent unconsciousness.
    PART TWO will become effective only if you are unable to communicate your treatment preferences. Reasonable and appropriate efforts will be made to communicate with you about your treatment preferences before PART TWO becomes effective.
    You should talk to your family and others close to you about your treatment preferences
      </i>
      .
   PART THREE
   GUARDIANSHIP.
      <i>
       This part allows you to nominate a person to be your guardian should one ever be needed
      </i>
      .
   PART FOUR
   EFFECTIVENESS AND SIGNATURES.
      <i>
       This part requires your signature and the signatures of two witnesses.
    You must complete PART FOUR if you have filled out any other part of this form
      </i>
      .
      <i>
       You may fill out any or all of the first three parts listed above. You must fill out PART FOUR of this form in order for this form to be effective.
    You should give a copy of this completed form to people who might need it, such as your health care agent, your family, and your physician. Keep a copy of this completed form at home in a place where it can easily be found if it is needed. Review this completed form periodically to make sure it still reflects your preferences. If your preferences change, complete a new advance directive for health care.
    Using this form of advance directive for health care is completely optional. Other forms of advance directives for health care may be used in Georgia.
    You may revoke this completed form at any time. This completed form will replace any advance directive for health care, durable power of attorney for health care, health care proxy, or living will that you have completed before completing this form.
      </i>
      [ PART ONE: HEALTH CARE AGENT ]
      <i>
       [PART ONE will be effective even if PART TWO is not completed. A physician or health care provider who is directly involved in your health care may not serve as your health care agent. If you are married, a future divorce or annulment of your marriage will revoke the selection of your current spouse as your health care agent. If you are not married, a future marriage will revoke the selection of your health care agent unless the person you selected as your health care agent is your new spouse.]
      </i>
      <b>
       (1) Health Care Agent
    I select the following person as my health care agent to make health care decisions for me:
    Name: ____________________________________________________________________
    Address: _________________________________________________________________
    Telephone Numbers: _______________________________________________________
    (Home, Work, and Mobile)
    (2)
       <i>
        Back-up Health Care Agent
     [This section is optional.
       </i>
       <i>
        PART ONE will be effective even if this section is left blank.]
       </i>
       If my health care agent cannot be contacted in a reasonable time period and cannot be located with reasonable efforts or for any reason my health care agent is unavailable or unable or unwilling to act as my health care agent, then I select the following, each to act successively in the order named, as my back-up health care agent(s):
    Name: ____________________________________________________________________
    Address: _________________________________________________________________
    Telephone Numbers: _______________________________________________________
    (Home, Work, and Mobile)
    Name: ____________________________________________________________________

    (3)
       <i>
        General Powers of Health Care Agent
       </i>
       My health care agent will make health care decisions for me when I am unable to communicate my health care decisions or I choose to have my health care agent communicate my health care decisions.
    My health care agent will have the same authority to make any health care decision that I could make. My health care agent's authority includes, for example, the power to:

      <span>
       <b>
        ì
       </b>
      </span>

      <span>
       <b>
        ì
       </b>

      <span>
       <b>
        ì
       </b>
      </span>
      <b>
       Contract for any health care facility or service for me, and to obligate me to pay for these services (and my health care agent will not be financially liable for any services or care contracted for me or on my behalf).
    My health care agent will be my personal representative for all purposes of federal or state law related to privacy of medical records (including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) and will have the same access to my medical records that I have and can disclose the contents of my medical records to others for my ongoing health care.
    My health care agent may accompany me in an ambulance or air ambulance if in the opinion of the ambulance personnel protocol permits a passenger and my health care agent may visit or consult with me in person while I am in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, or other health care facility or service if its protocol permits visitation.
    My health care agent may present a copy of this advance directive for health care in lieu of the original and the copy will have the same meaning and effect as the original.
    I understand that under Georgia law:
      </b>
      <span>
       <b>
        ì
       </b>
      </span>
      <b>
       My health care agent may refuse to act as my health care agent;

      <span>
       <b>
        ì
       </b>
      </span>
      <b>
       A court can take away the powers of my health care agent if it finds that my health care agent is not acting properly; and

      <span>
       <b>
        ì
       </b>
      </span>
      <b>
       My health care agent does not have the power to make health care decisions for me regarding psychosurgery, sterilization, or treatment or involuntary hospitalization for mental or emotional illness, developmental disability, or addictive disease.
    (4)
       <i>
        Guidance for Health Care Agent
       </i>
       When making health care decisions for me, my health care agent should think about what action would be consistent with past conversations we have had, my treatment preferences as expressed in PART TWO (if I have filled out PART TWO), my religious and other beliefs and values, and how I have handled medical and other important issues in the past. If what I would decide is still unclear, then my health care agent should make decisions for me that my health care agent believes are in my best interest, considering the benefits, burdens, and risks of my current circumstances and treatment options.

       <i>

        This advance directive for health care will be effective even if PART THREE is left blank. If you wish to nominate a person to be your guardian in the event a court decides that a guardian should be appointed, complete PART THREE. A court will appoint a guardian for you if the court finds that you are not able to make significant responsible decisions for yourself regarding your personal support, safety, or welfare. A court will appoint the person nominated by you if the court finds that the appointment will serve your best interest and welfare. If you have selected a health care agent in PART ONE, you may (but are not required to) nominate the same person to be your guardian. If your health care agent and guardian are not the same person, your health care agent will have priority over your guardian in making your health care decisions, unless a court determines otherwise.]

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

    - Sovereign immunity of a county was not waived by O.C.G.A. Ch. 35, T. 31 since the law does not create a general duty for counties to vaccinate officers. The chapter only requires vaccination at the request of an employee. Diaz v. Gwinnett County, <cite class="ga_app_court">225 Ga. App. 807</cite>, <cite class="app_court">485 S.E.2d 42</cite> (1997).

    Official immunity of county employees was not waived since there was no evidence that the employees acted maliciously, willfully, or corruptly in connection with the failure of a police officer to be vaccinated against hepatitis B.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that, by reason of their employment, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and public safety officers are required to work in the midst of and are subject to exposure to infectious diseases, especially hepatitis B and hepatitis C; that the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have estimated that 200,000 persons in the United States are infected each year with hepatitis B and of that number 25 percent become ill, 10,000 require hospitalization, and 5,000 die; that it is estimated that there are from 500,000 to 1,000,000 infectious hepatitis B carriers in the United States, of which up to 80 percent of such chronic carriers are unaware that they have hepatitis B and are capable of spreading it; that 3.9 million Americans are infected with chronic hepatitis C; that 350,000 to 450,000 new cases of chronic hepatitis C occur each year; that there is no known cure for hepatitis B or hepatitis C and for firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and public safety officers, there is no way of knowing who among those being helped at an accident, a fire, or any incident are hepatitis B or hepatitis C carriers. The General Assembly further finds and declares that all the aforementioned conditions exist and arise out of or in the course of such employment.

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

      The General Assembly finds that although cardiopulmonary resuscitation has proved invaluable in the reversal of sudden, unexpected death, it is appropriate for an attending physician, in certain circumstances, to issue an order not to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a patient where appropriate consent or authorization has been obtained.The General Assembly further finds that there is a need to establish and clarify the rights and obligations of patients, their families or representatives, and health care providers regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the issuance of orders not to resuscitate.The General Assembly further finds that, in the interest of protecting individual autonomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation in some circumstances may cause loss of patient dignity and unnecessary pain and suffering. In recognition of the considerable uncertainty in the medical and legal professions as to the legality of implementing orders not to resuscitate, in recognition of the request of the Supreme Court of Georgia for legislative guidance in this area, and in recognition of the dignity and privacy which patients have a right to expect, the General Assembly declares that the laws of the State of Georgia shall recognize the right of patients or other authorized persons to instruct physicians and other health care personnel to refrain from cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

       It shall be lawful for the attending physician to issue an order not to resuscitate pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. Any written order issued by the attending physician using the term "do not resuscitate," "DNR," "order not to resuscitate," "do not attempt resuscitation," "DNAR," "no code," "allow natural death," "AND," "order to allow natural death," or substantially similar language in the patient's chart shall constitute a legally sufficient order and shall authorize a physician, health care professional, nurse, physician assistant, caregiver, or emergency medical technician to withhold or withdraw cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Such an order shall remain effective, whether or not the patient is receiving treatment from or is a resident of a health care facility, until the order is canceled as provided in Code Section 31-39-5 or until consent for such order is revoked as provided in Code Section 31-39-6, whichever occurs earlier.

   If there is no second parent, if the other parent is not present, or if the other parent simply prefers not to participate in the decision, the consent of one parent to a DNR order is legally sufficient under the statute.
   However, if there is a second custodial parent who disagrees with the decision to forego cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the second parent may revoke consent under the terms of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A.

       The General Assembly finds that childhood lead poisoning is a devastating environmental health hazard to the children of this state. Exposure to even low levels of lead increases a child's risks of developing permanent reading and learning disabilities, intelligence quotient deficiencies, impaired hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity, behavior problems, and other neurological problems. It is estimated that thousands of children below the age of six are affected by lead poisoning in Georgia. Childhood lead poisoning is dangerous to the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c41s31-41-2ol1b">
       Childhood lead poisoning is the result of environmental exposure to lead. The most significant source of environmental lead is lead-based paint, particularly in housing built prior to 1978, which becomes accessible to children as paint chips, house dust, and soil contaminated by lead-based paint. The danger posed by lead-based paint hazards can be controlled by abatement, renovation, or interim controls of lead-based paint or by measures to limit exposure to lead-based paint hazards.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c41s31-41-2ol1c">
       It is crucial that the identification of lead hazards and subsequent implementation of interim control, renovation, or abatement procedures be accomplished in a manner that does not result in additional harm to the public or the environment. Improper lead abatement or renovation constitutes a serious threat to persons residing in or otherwise using an affected structure or site, to those performing such work, to the environment, and to the general public.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c41s31-41-2ol1d">
       The General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to establish minimum standards for the training and certification or licensure of all persons performing lead hazard reduction activities and for inspections, risk assessments, and planning and performance of interim controls, renovation, or abatement measures for such activities.

       The General Assembly finds that childhood lead poisoning prevention activities are currently carried out within the Environmental Health and Injury Prevention, Epidemiology and Prevention, and Laboratory Branches of the Department of Public Health. These activities include lead poisoning case identification, laboratory support, identification of exposure sources, environmental management, and lead hazard reduction. Childhood lead poisoning cases are identified through screening tests conducted by public health clinics and private health care providers and by laboratory reporting of test results. In 1994, lead poisoning was established as a notifiable condition and made part of the Notifiable Disease reporting system.

      <li id="t31c41s31-41-11ol1b">
       The General Assembly further finds that the Georgia Public Health Laboratory is licensed and certified to analyze blood specimens for lead. Laboratory services are provided for children screened in public health clinics and for children without health insurance screened by private health care providers. For each reported case of lead poisoning, an environmental investigation is conducted to identify the source of lead. Environmental health specialists assess the primary residence and other locations frequented by the lead poisoned child. Information is collected from parents and caregivers; on-site surface testing and environmental sample collection and analysis are done as needed. When the lead source is identified, recommendations are made for the mitigation or abatement of the lead hazard. Identified lead poisoning cases are tracked collaboratively by public health nurses and environmental health specialists to assure that appropriate treatment is received and that the child does not reenter the environment where the exposure occurred.

The term includes municipal, school, hotel, or motel pools and any pool to which access is granted in exchange for payment of a daily fee. This chapter shall not apply to a private pool or hot tub serving a single-family dwelling and used only by the residents of the dwelling and their guests. This chapter also shall not apply to apartment complex pools, country club pools, subdivision pools which are open only to residents of the subdivision and their guests, therapeutic pools used in physical therapy programs operated by medical facilities licensed by the department or operated by a licensed physical therapist, therapeutic chambers drained, cleaned, and refilled after each individual use, or to religious ritual baths used solely for religious purposes.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the United States, limiting daily activities for more than 17.4 million citizens;
    </p>

     "(4) Although prevailing myths inaccurately portray arthritis as an old person's disease, arthritis is a multigenerational disease that has become one of this country's most pressing public health problems;

     "(5) This disease has a significant impact on quality of life, not only for the individual who experiences its painful symptoms and resulting disability, but also for family members and caregivers;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Compounding this picture are the enormous economic and social costs associated with treating arthritis and its complications; in 2003, the costs were $127.3 billion with $80.8 billion and $47 billion attributable to medical care expenditures and lost earnings, respectively; $3.9 billion of that was the cost in Georgia;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) Currently, the challenge exists to ensure delivery of effective, but often underutilized, interventions that are necessary in the prevention or reduction of arthritis related pain and disability;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) Although there exists a large quantity of public information and programs about arthritis, it remains inadequately disseminated and insufficient in addressing the needs of specific diverse populations and other underserved groups;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(9) The Arthritis Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials have led in the development of a public health strategy, the National Arthritis Action Plan, to respond to this challenge; and
    </p>
    <p>

     "(3) Establish a solid scientific base of knowledge on the prevention of arthritis and related disabilities through surveillance, epidemiology, and prevention research;

      </p>
      <p>
       WHEREAS, the Member States seek to increase individual liberty and control over personal Health Care decisions, and believe the best method to achieve these ends is by vesting regulatory authority over Health Care in the States; and

      <p>
       WHEREAS, by acting in concert, the Member States may express and inspire confidence in the ability of each Member State to govern Health Care effectively; and

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that it is estimated that as many as 55,000 Georgia residents suffer from lupus, a life-long autoimmune disease in which the immune system becomes unbalanced, causing inflammation, tissue damage, seizures, strokes, heart attacks, miscarriages, and organ failure. Although anyone can develop lupus, it strikes mostly women of childbearing age; African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women are two to three times more likely than Caucasians to develop lupus. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose and often is misdiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. It is in the public interest for this state to establish an entity to develop and implement a comprehensive program to improve education and awareness about lupus for health care providers and the general public.

      The General Assembly finds that Georgia faces population and community health challenges. The current health infrastructure must be adapted to adequately integrate state and private resources in a manner that will serve to maximize the state's goals, including improved access to care, effective health management strategies, and cost control measures. All components of the state's health care system must be more strategic and better coordinated. The General Assembly, therefore, declares it to be the public policy of the state to unite the major stakeholders of the state's health care system under a strategic vision for Georgia. The public policy shall be realized through an agency focused on strategic health care management and coordination.
