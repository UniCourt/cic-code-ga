      Bank's exercise of power of sale not state action.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Statutory authorization of right of creditor bank to contract with debtors for power of sale under deed to secure debt does not, when combined with state's general regulation of banking industry's loan making procedures, convert exercise of such power of sale into state action; therefore, any contention that the creditor's exercise of the creditor's power of sale under a deed to secure debt violated the debtors' rights to procedural due process under U.S. Const., amend. 14 is without merit.

Each day during which the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

The financial institution or other person assessed as provided in this subsection shall have the right to request a hearing into the matter within ten days after notification of the assessment has been served upon the financial institution involved; otherwise, such penalty shall be final except as to judicial review as provided in Code Section 7-1-90.

Saturday shall not be construed to be a business day and any business conducted on Saturday may be deferred to the next succeeding business day, provided such deferral is applicable to all business conducted by said financial institution on that day and is in accordance with a resolution adopted by the board of directors of the institution. Customers of any financial institution adopting such a deferral policy shall be notified of any such deferral of business by prominent notice posted in the lobby of the financial institution and by circularization in regular statement mailings at least 30 days prior to the effective date of any such deferral policy. Any financial institution changing its permissive closing day, temporarily or otherwise, shall post a notice of the change and the effective date thereof in a conspicuous place at each location affected by the change at least 30 days preceding the date of the change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, credit unions serving a limited membership base may establish uniform business hours and days consistent with the needs of their membership.

     <p>
      Any financial institution of whose business or property the department has taken possession as receiver may, at any time within ten days after the department has become receiver, apply to the principal court for an order requiring the department to show cause why it should not be enjoined from continuing as receiver. Service may be made in such action by serving the commissioner personally or by leaving a copy with the deputy in charge of his or her office in the department or by serving the deputy receiver appointed by the department to manage the affairs of such financial institution. The court shall, after a hearing upon the merits, either dismiss the application or order the department to surrender to the financial institution possession of its business and property; but no such injunction shall issue where the department has been appointed receiver by action of a court of competent jurisdiction or by action of the financial institution itself, in accordance with this chapter. Such application for injunction may in the discretion of the court be heard at any time after service as provided in this Code section, with the right by either party to appeal, as in other cases of applications for temporary injunction.

      All claims against the financial institution, action upon which has not been commenced prior to the time the department took possession, shall be presented in the regular manner provided by this chapter for the presentation of claims. Neither a depositor or other creditor of the financial institution nor any other claimant may maintain any action at law or in equity upon such claim, except by regular method provided by this chapter for exceptions to the accounting of the department as receiver. However, an action for the return of specific property or property with respect to which the plaintiff holds a perfected security interest or security title which could have been recovered by the plaintiff from the financial institution in receivership may be maintained in the principal court against the department in its name as receiver of the financial institution. All actions pending against the financial institution when the department takes possession shall be automatically stayed during the receivership, provided that all such actions, except those specified in subsection (b) of Code Section 7-1-190, may proceed with prior approval of the principal court.

       The notice to depositors shall state the amount which the books or other records of the financial institution show to be due to such depositor. It shall also state that unless such depositor shall, within a specified time, present to the department his bank statement or passbook or other evidence of his account showing a different amount to be due or unless such depositor shall, within a specified time from the date of such notice, otherwise prove in the manner provided by this chapter that a different amount is due, the amount shown to be due by the books of the financial institution will be conclusively presumed to be correct unless the court, pursuant to this chapter, grants him an extension of time.

       The department shall also advertise, in the manner prescribed by this chapter, its determination to liquidate the financial institution. Such advertisement shall state that the department has filed an inventory and appraisement of the assets of the institution and shall designate the superior court with which such documents have been filed and shall describe the legal consequences to depositors and other creditors of failure to prove those claims within the time set in the notice. For purposes of this advertisement and other notices or advertisements required hereunder, the department may, to the extent it deems appropriate, describe shareholders of credit unions as such, not by use of the defined term "depositors" used in this chapter.

       The department shall specify as the last day upon which depositors and other creditors can prove their claims a date at least 30 days after the date of the sending of such notice to depositors and creditors. However, claims based upon deficiencies in, or surcharges with respect to, assets which such financial institution held in a fiduciary capacity may be proved at any time within six months after the appointment of a substituted fiduciary of the estate of which such assets were a part and the adjudication of the account of such estate by the competent court.

      Any reasonable expenditure made by the department as receiver of a financial institution, including any expense incurred in the management, reorganization, consolidation, liquidation, or distribution of the assets and affairs of the financial institution, any payment of a loan or interest thereon under Code Section 7-1-164, and any compensation paid to the deputy receiver, attorneys, or any other person employed to assist the department in such management, reorganization, consolidation, liquidation, or distribution shall be paid out of the assets of the financial institution, provided it is included in any partial or final account filed by the department pursuant to this chapter and is approved by the principal court in which such account is filed. Where such expenses are incurred or such compensation is paid for the benefit of the estate of more than one financial institution in the possession of the department as receiver, an equitable portion of such expenses or compensation shall be paid out of the assets of each financial institution on whose behalf such expenditures were incurred or paid.

       At any time after the expiration of the period fixed by the department for the presentation of claims, it may file a partial account of its administration of the business and property of the financial institution, duly verified under oath or affirmation, with the principal court. If the department does not file its first account within one year after it takes possession of a financial institution, any depositor, other creditor, or shareholder of such financial institution may petition the court to order the department to file an account. The court may, in its discretion, grant or refuse the petition. Whenever it becomes economically advisable to wind up finally the affairs of a financial institution in liquidation, the department shall file with the principal court its final account, duly verified under oath or affirmation. The clerk of the principal court shall not be under any duty to recopy or otherwise to record any account and shall make no charge except the regular fee for filing such or similar papers.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c01s7-1-198ol1b">
       The account shall present the department's administration of the estate, including a statement of all receipts or expenditures, a list of all claims which have been allowed, and a separate list of claims which have been objected to or are disputed, showing as to all depositors and other creditors, their names and addresses, the amounts due or claimed to be due to them, and any priorities in the order of distribution granted to or claimed by them. A final account need not present matters previously settled incident to partial accounts.

       The department shall forthwith give written or printed notice of the filing of an account to all corporations or persons whom it knows to be, or who claim to be depositors or other creditors or who have given to it notice claiming a right of attachment or execution. Such notice shall also state that unless an exception to the account or to any item therein is filed with the principal court within 30 days from the date of the filing thereof, it will be confirmed absolutely. The department shall also advertise such notice in a newspaper or newspapers as provided in this chapter, stating the date upon which it has filed its partial or final account and that all exceptions to the account must be filed within 30 days from the date of the filing of the account. The department shall forthwith file with the court, under oath or affirmation, a statement that it has, in the manner provided by this chapter, sent both the notice of its determination to liquidate and the notice of its filing of an account to all corporations or persons entitled thereto. The department shall also file the proofs of publication of the advertisements required by this Code section.

       Any corporation or person who is or who claims to be a depositor, other creditor, or shareholder of a financial institution or who has given to the department notice of his claim to the right of execution or attachment or who asserts any other type of claim against a financial institution may, within 30 days after the filing of an account by the department, file in the principal court specific exceptions in writing, under oath or affirmation, to such account or to any item therein. Notice of any exception to an individual item in an account shall forthwith be personally served upon or sent by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the corporation or person whose claim is thus objected to or his counsel and also the department or the deputy receiver managing the affairs of the particular financial institution or the counsel of either. Affidavit of the serving or sending of such notice shall forthwith be filed with the court.

       Whenever an exception is filed to any expenditure made by the department as an expense of administration, the department shall keep an accurate record of the salaries and other expenses properly incurred by it in the contesting of such exception. If the exception is overruled and the expenditure is sustained, the court may, in its discretion, assess such expenses and salaries, together with the regular costs provided by law, upon the depositor, other creditor, or shareholder filing such exception.

If any funds are available for distribution, the department shall then declare and pay out of such funds a partial or a final dividend, according to the priorities established by law. If the department has rejected any deposit or claim or if any exception has been filed, the court shall confirm the account as to all other matters and claims.

After its final accounting and discharge, the department shall have power to make further distribution to the creditors, depositors, and shareholders when, in its opinion, sufficient funds are realized to justify such distribution after deducting reasonable costs for collection, preservation, and distribution. If the department is of the opinion that the funds collected or probably to be collected will be insufficient to make a distribution practicable and that all interested claimants will not in the future have their claims satisfied, it shall, after deducting reasonable costs for collection and preservation, hold the remainder of such property subject to Article 5 of Chapter 12 of Title 44. Thereafter, the articles of incorporation or charter shall no longer be valid and the department shall notify the Secretary of State that the receivership has been concluded.

       - When principal-agent relationship exists between the bank and the depositor for purpose of collecting a check and an agency ceases due to the failure of the bank and takeover of the bank by the superintendent of banks (now commissioner of banking and finance), the check and the check's proceeds are property of the depositor and not subject to the provisions of this section.

       - If, in administration of assets of insolvent bank, the superintendent of banks (now commissioner of banking and finance), comes into possession of deeds given to the bank conveying title to the land, leaving debtor to bank owner of a mere equity in premises conveyed, the state's waiver of the state's right to first collect the state's taxes (in favor of depositors' claims), as embodied in Ga.

      A financial institution or mortgage lender, as such term is defined by Code Section 7-1-1000, may charge a convenience fee provided that such fee is permissible in accordance with Code Section 13-1-15. For purposes of this Code section, the term "convenience fee" means any additional amount imposed to a consumer at the time of a transaction for the election of making a payment by electronic means. A convenience fee may include, but is not limited to, any fee charged for payment to an account with the assistance of a live representative or agent of the financial institution or mortgage lender, by telephone, using a voice response unit, or other electronic means. A convenience fee does not include a discount offered by a lender or merchant to a person for payment by cash, check, or similar means.

       Operation of a general insurance agency does not qualify as an "incidental power"
      
      as it is not convenient or useful in connection with one of the bank's activities established pursuant to the exercise of the bank's express powers. The business of a general insurance agency encompasses selling various types of insurance to the general public. In operating such an agency, a bank would be engaged in an independent, profit-seeking venture unrelated to the bank's express powers. Independent Ins. Agents of Ga., Inc. v.

        Operation of general insurance agency does not qualify as "incidental power"
       
       as it is not convenient or useful in connection with one of the bank's activities established pursuant to the exercise of the bank's express powers. The business of a general insurance agency encompasses selling various types of insurance to the general public. In operating such an agency, a bank would be engaged in an independent, profit-seeking venture unrelated to the bank's express powers. Independent Ins. Agents of Ga., Inc. v.

       Operation of general insurance agency does not qualify as "incidental power"
      
      as it is not convenient or useful in connection with one of the bank's activities established pursuant to the exercise of the bank's express powers. The business of a general insurance agency encompasses selling various types of insurance to the general public.

      Notwithstanding the limitations of Code Section 7-1-288, a bank may purchase, sell, underwrite, and hold securities which are obligations in the form of bonds, notes, or debentures or mutual funds, investment trusts, or pools primarily consisting of such bonds, notes, or debentures, and may purchase, sell, and hold corporate debt obligations, to the extent authorized by regulations of the department. The department may issue regulations which prescribe operating restrictions and standards of conduct dealing with potential conflicts of interest and shall prescribe rules for divestiture of securities held in violation of such regulations and fines for violations not to exceed $10,000.00 per day during which each violation remains uncorrected. A bank may hold without limit securities which are obligations of the United States or obligations which are guaranteed fully as to principal and interest by the United States or general obligations of any state.

       For purposes of this Code section, the term "federal power" means any banking or corporate power, right, benefit, privilege, or immunity of a national bank, the deposits of which are federally insured, that may be exercised by a national bank doing business in this state pursuant to the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq.; any other federal statute; or any regulation, ruling, circular, bulletin, order, or interpretation issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Such term shall include only the provisions set forth above which were effective on January 1, 2018.

       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, a bank may exercise any federal power while a national bank may also exercise such power subject to the same limitations and restrictions as are applicable to national banks, provided that the requirements of subsection (d) of this Code section have been satisfied. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as authorizing a bank chartered by this state to exercise a federal power prior to compliance with subsection (d) of this Code section.

       In furtherance of the commissioner's statutory duties to regulate, supervise, and examine, a bank shall notify the commissioner in writing by certified or registered mail that, pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this Code section, it intends to exercise a federal power or to avail itself of any federal preclusion or preemption of any provision of law, rule, or regulation of this state. Such notice shall include the specific federal authorization of the activity to be utilized, the proposed action to be undertaken by the bank, documentation indicating that the bank satisfies the prescribed federal standards, if any, to engage in the activity, and such other information as may be required by the department. Upon receipt of such notice, the commissioner shall determine whether the exercise of any federal power or the availing of any federal preclusion or preemption, or any part thereof, by the bank is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or presents undue risk to the safety and soundness of the banking system. In making such a determination, the commissioner shall consider the financial condition of the bank, the regulatory safety and soundness ratings of the bank, the ability of bank management to administer and supervise the activity, and the overall impact on the safety and soundness to all other state chartered banks. Based on such a determination, the commissioner may object to the exercise of the federal power, in whole or in part, or to the federal preclusion or preemption of the law, rule, or regulation of this state, in whole or in part, including objecting to a level or quantity above which a bank may be seeking to exercise a federal power or availing itself of any federal preclusion or preemption of law, rule, or regulation of this state. If the commissioner so objects, the commissioner shall deliver such objection in writing by certified or registered mail to the bank within 45 days of receipt of the notice; provided, however, that the commissioner may extend such period of review for an additional 45 days by providing the bank with written notice of such extension prior to the expiration of the initial notice period. If the commissioner sends such an objection, the federal power, preclusion, or preemption, or the part thereof, objected to by the commissioner shall not be exercised by the bank pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this Code section. The objection by the commissioner of a bank's intent to exercise a federal power or avail itself of any federal preclusion or preemption shall not preclude such bank from providing notice to the department of its intent to exercise the same federal power or to avail itself of the same federal preclusion or preemption at a later date; provided, however, that the requirements of this subsection shall be applicable for any such additional notice. Further, in the event a bank determines, after satisfying the notice provisions of this subsection, that it no longer wishes to exercise a federal power or avail itself of any federal preclusion or preemption, then such bank shall provide written notice of such fact to the commissioner by certified or registered mail.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-352" target="_self">7-1-352</a></cite>, a bank incurs no liability for the uses to which trust funds are applied after the funds are withdrawn. On the other hand, the statute contains no language protecting the bank against liability for honoring forged or otherwise improper checks or endorsements. Trust Co. Bank v.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-370" target="_self">7-1-370</a></cite>) was directed at a bank's short-term deposits in other financial institutions. The language of former Code 1933,
   §
   41A-1701 was broad enough to cover a savings and loan account as a deposit, therefore, former Code 1933,
   §
   41A-1309 was inapplicable to deposits in mutual savings and loan associations and former Code 1933,
   §
   41A-1701 permitted banks to deposit the bank's funds in these associations. Since the Georgia Supreme Court has not ruled on the question of whether such a deposit was equivalent to the purchase of shares in a corporation, federal law will not permit a state bank member of the federal reserve to make deposits in a Georgia building and loan association; however, there was no reason why a state bank which is not a member of the federal reserve cannot deposit the bank's funds in a state association. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-66.

The failure of a bank or trust company to maintain at least five directors at any time does not exculpate the remaining directors from their obligations and liabilities associated with the actions and decisions made as directors of the financial institution, nor does it in any way void any actions taken or decisions made by the board of directors during any such time that there were less than five directors.

The FDIC rebutted the business judgment presumption, and the FDIC's claims could go forward, as the allegations of the complaint, taken together, painted a picture of the officers and directors failing to implement any safeguards and ignoring the ones actually put in place so that they could pursue a rapid growth strategy and accumulate large profits in a short period of time.

      In addition to other provisions in this chapter and federal law, a bank or trust company shall not make loans or otherwise extend financing to any one of its directors or policy-making officers except on terms, rates, and conditions which are not preferential. Preferential terms, rates, and conditions shall be determined by comparison to those terms, rates, and conditions offered contemporaneously to other borrowers making substantially similar loan requests, having substantially similar credit histories, and offering substantially similar collateral. Such loans shall be made only after the application of prudent loan underwriting criteria normally applied to loan requests of a similar nature from applicants who are not directors and policy-making officers. Approval procedures for such loans should be designed to minimize any potential abuse by bank insiders.

        - To determine whether a bank facility is a branch office, the court should look to four pertinent factual criteria; i.e., distance separating main banking house and the facility, number of intervening structures, lack of physical connection between main banking house and the facility, and the economic effect of the facility on the balance of competition between area banks.

If such a policy is adopted, written notice of the policy and the effective date of such policy shall be provided to each member of the credit union not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of such policy.

In the case of a federal credit union converting to a state credit union, such converting credit union may keep its existing members at the time of conversion, but after conversion eligibility for membership in the converted credit union must comply with state law.

The central credit union shall maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and such other reserves as may be required by the rules and regulations of the department.

Section 1751, et seq.; any other federal statute; or any regulation, ruling, circular, bulletin, order, or interpretation issued by the National Credit Union Administration. Such term shall include only the provisions set forth above which were effective on January 1, 2018.

Such notice shall include the specific federal authorization of the activity to be utilized, the proposed action to be undertaken by the credit union, documentation indicating that the credit union satisfies the prescribed federal standards, if any, to engage in the activity, and such other information as may be required by the department. Upon receipt of such notice, the commissioner shall determine whether the exercise of any federal power or the availing of any federal preclusion or preemption, or any part thereof, by the credit union is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or presents undue risk to the safety and soundness of the banking system. In making such a determination, the commissioner shall consider the financial condition of the credit union, the regulatory safety and soundness ratings of the credit union, the ability of credit union management to administer and supervise the activity, and the overall impact on the safety and soundness to all other state chartered credit unions. Based on such a determination, the commissioner may object to the exercise of the federal power, in whole or in part, or to the federal preclusion or preemption of the law, rule, or regulation of this state, in whole or in part, including objecting to a level or quantity above which a credit union may be seeking to exercise a federal power or availing itself of any federal preclusion or preemption of law, rule, or regulation of this state. If the commissioner so objects, the commissioner shall deliver such objection in writing by certified or registered mail to the credit union within 45 days of receipt of the notice; provided, however, that the commissioner may extend such period of review for an additional 45 days by providing the credit union with written notice of such extension prior to the expiration of the initial notice period. If the commissioner sends such an objection, the federal power, preclusion, or preemption, or the part thereof, objected to by the commissioner shall not be exercised by the credit union pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this Code section. The objection by the commissioner of a credit union's intent to exercise a federal power or avail itself of any federal preclusion or preemption shall not preclude such credit union from providing notice to the department of its intent to exercise the same federal power or to avail itself of the same federal preclusion or preemption at a later date; provided, however, that the requirements of this subsection shall be applicable for any such additional notice. Further, in the event a credit union determines, after satisfying the notice provisions of this subsection, that it no longer wishes to exercise a federal power or avail itself of any federal preclusion or preemption, then such credit union shall provide written notice of such fact to the commissioner by certified or registered mail.

       Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Code section, the department may require an applicant or a licensee to provide additional coverage for the adequate protection of payment instrument holders if the average daily outstanding balances for payment instrument sellers exceed the current bond amount, the average daily outstanding orders to transmit not yet paid for money transmitters exceed the current bond amount, or the department determines that additional coverage is necessary in order to satisfy the department that the provisions of subsection (a) of Code Section 7-1-684 are fulfilled. A licensee's level of outstandings shall be determined by the portion of the licensee's financial reports dealing with transactions originating in Georgia which shall be submitted to the department as set forth in its rules and regulations.

Damage payments due under the bond include moneys owed to the department for fees, fines, or penalties. In no event shall the aggregate liability of the surety exceed the principal sum of the face amount of the bond. Claimants against the licensee may bring an action directly on the surety bond.

The department may issue the applicant a license to transmit money or sell payment instruments if the department determines to its general satisfaction that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t07c01s7-1-684ol1a1">

       The department shall not issue a license or may revoke a license if it finds that the applicant, licensee, or authorized agent; any person who is a director, officer, partner, covered employee, or ultimate equitable owner of the applicant, licensee, or authorized agent; or any individual who directs the affairs of or controls or establishes policy for the applicant, licensee, or authorized agent has been convicted of a felony in any jurisdiction or of a crime which, if committed within this state, would constitute a felony under the laws of this state. For the purposes of this article, a person shall be deemed to have been convicted of a crime if such person shall have pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to a charge thereof before a court or federal magistrate or shall have been found guilty thereof by the decision or judgment of a court or federal magistrate or by the verdict of a jury, irrespective of the pronouncement of sentence or the suspension thereof and regardless of whether first offender treatment without adjudication of guilt pursuant to the charge was entered or an adjudication or sentence was otherwise withheld or not entered on that charge, unless and until such plea of guilty or such decision, judgment, or verdict shall have been set aside, reversed, or otherwise abrogated by lawful judicial process or until probation, sentence, or both probation and sentence of a first offender have been successfully completed and documented or unless the person convicted of the crime shall have received a pardon therefor from the President of the United States or the governor or other pardoning authority in the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred or shall have received an official certification of pardon granted by the state's pardoning body where the conviction occurred which removes the legal disabilities resulting from such conviction and restores civil and political rights.

The department may submit directly to the Georgia Crime Information Center two complete sets of fingerprints of such person, together with the required records search fees and such other information as may be required. Fees for background checks that the department administers shall be sent to the department by applicants, licensees, and authorized agents together with the fingerprints.

Fees for background checks that the department administers shall be submitted to the department by applicants, licensees, and authorized agents together with two complete sets of fingerprints, and the department is authorized to net such fees to recover any costs incurred by the department related to running the background checks. Upon receipt of fingerprints, fees, and other required information, the Georgia Crime Information Center shall promptly transmit one set of fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a search of bureau records and an appropriate report and shall retain the other set and promptly conduct a search of its own records and records to which it has access. The Georgia Crime Information Center shall notify the department in writing of any derogatory finding, including, but not limited to, any conviction data regarding the fingerprint records check, or if there is no such finding. All conviction data received by the department or by the applicant, licensee, or authorized agent shall be used by the party requesting such data for the exclusive purpose of carrying out the responsibilities of this article, shall not be a public record, shall be confidential, and shall not be disclosed to any other person or agency except to any person or agency which otherwise has a legal right to inspect such data. All such records shall be maintained by the department and the applicant, licensee, or authorized agent pursuant to laws regarding such records and the rules and regulations of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Georgia Crime Information Center, as applicable. As used in this Code section, "conviction data" means a record of a finding, verdict, or plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendere with regard to any crime, regardless of whether an appeal of the conviction has been sought.

Applicants and licensees shall be responsible for any applicable fees charged by the Georgia Crime Information Center.

This provision does not apply to directors, officers, partners, or ultimate equitable owners of applicants or licensees or to persons who direct the affairs of or control or establish policy for applicants or licensees, whose background shall have been investigated through the department before taking office, beginning employment, or securing ownership. Upon receipt of information from the Georgia Crime Information Center that is incomplete or that indicates a covered employee has a criminal record in any state other than Georgia, the employer shall submit to the department two complete sets of fingerprint cards for such person, together with the applicable fees and any other required information.

      As used in this article, the term "domestic international banking facility" means the location within this state of any banking office, other than an "international bank agency," as defined in Code Section 7-1-710, which derives its funds (1) from sources outside of the United States, (2) from another domestic international banking facility, or (3) from temporary advances from its parent organization and employs those funds for banking purposes outside of the United States or through its parent organization, but does not accept deposits subject to check or draft. A domestic international banking facility, when properly established pursuant to this article, shall not be considered to be a "branch office" or "main office" as defined in Code Section 7-1-600.

When the word franchise is considered in connection with other items exempted from taxation, it must be taken as meaning powers conferred by a sovereignty, and that exemption granted is from taxation of property right in powers so conferred, and not exemption from license or occupation fee required by municipality in order to do business.

    - When a deposit is made in joint form for convenience only and not for the purpose of making a gift to the other party, the party making the deposit may recover. The presumption of joint ownership is a rebuttable one and when the joint account was created as a matter of convenience with no intention of conferring a beneficial interest upon the codepositor the presumption is rebutted.

       "Net contribution" of a party to a multiple-party account as of any given time means the sum of all deposits thereto made by or for him, less all withdrawals made by or for him which have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance. The term includes, in addition, any proceeds of deposit life insurance added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c01s7-1-810ol17">
       "Party" means a person who, by the terms of the account, has a present right, subject to request, to payment from a multiple-party account. A P.O.D. payee or beneficiary of a trust account is a party only after the account becomes payable to him by reason of his surviving the original payee or trustee. Unless the context otherwise requires, it includes a guardian, conservator, personal representative, or assignee, including an attaching creditor, of a party. It also includes a person identified as a trustee of an account for another, whether or not a beneficiary is named; but it does not include any named beneficiary unless he has a present right of withdrawal.

       "Request" means a proper request for withdrawal or a check or order for payment which complies with all conditions of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the financial institution; but, if the financial institution conditions withdrawal or payment on advance notice, for purposes of this article the request for withdrawal or payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for withdrawal.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c01s7-1-810ol113">
       "Sums on deposit" means the balance payable on a multiple-party account, including interest, dividends, and, in addition, any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of a party.

       "Trust account" means an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries where the relationship is established by the form of the account and the deposit agreement with the financial institution and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account; it is not essential that payment to the beneficiary be mentioned in the deposit agreement. A trust account does not include a regular trust account under a testamentary trust or a trust agreement which has significance apart from the account or a fiduciary account arising from a fiduciary relation such as attorney-client.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c01s7-1-810ol115">

       - In a dispute over a joint account created by a father, mother, and daughter, although only the father made contributions to the account, the daughter's contributions could include deposits made by the father for the daughter; because some evidence indicated an intent that the money would belong to the daughter, the trial court erred by concluding that all of the funds belonged to the mother after the father's death.

       - In a dispute over a joint account created by a father, mother, and daughter, although only the father made contributions to the account, the daughter's contributions could include deposits made by him for her; because some evidence indicated an intent that the money would belong to the daughter, the trial court erred by concluding that all of the funds belonged to the mother after the father's death.

        - Viewed in conjunction with everything presented to the court, the trustee's evidence did not clearly lead to the conclusion that the claimant intended to make a voluntary transfer of the claimant's property to the debtor. Therefore, the trustee failed to overcome the presumption that the funds belonged to the claimant. In re Thornton, 549 Bankr. 922 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2016).

       - When savings certificates were issued jointly to a decedent and another party and since the certificates contain no language expressly creating a survivorship interest, one of two presumptions will be applied, depending on the date of issue of the certificates: (1) if the certificates were issued before the effective date of former Code 1933,
   §
   41A-3804 (see now O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-813" target="_self">7-1-813</a></cite>), July 1, 1976, the presumption is that there was no right of survivorship intended; or (2) if the certificates were issued after July 1, 1976, there is a presumption that a right of survivorship was intended unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Collins v. Collins, <cite class="ga_app_court">176 Ga. App. 79</cite>, <cite class="app_court">335 S.E.2d 307</cite> (1985).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-813" target="_self">7-1-813</a></cite> was effectively rebutted since there was testimony from a family member that around the time decedent opened a certificate account with the money from the decedent's sister's estate, the decedent gave assurances that the money was "taken care of" and would eventually reach those the money was intended to reach, as the plaintiff would "do the right thing with it".

       When as the decedent had done with other assets, a decedent designated the defendant as co-owner with the decedent of subordinated debentures with right of survivorship, evidence was sufficient to show that decedent intended that the defendant should receive the gifts which resulted from the defendant's transfer of their debentures and the sale of stock decedent owned individually.

       - In an action by the executor of a joint tenant's estate against the executor of the surviving joint tenant's estate, evidence presented by the former was not sufficient to overcome the presumption that funds in joint bank accounts belong to the survivor's estate.

        <p>
       Denial of a sister's and an executrix's motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict were reversed as a constructive trust could not be imposed over the proceeds of a condemnation since: (1) a mother did not make any agreement with her children regarding the quitclaim deeds or the proceeds of the condemnation; (2) the documents signed by the siblings were unequivocal and unrestricted; (3) the mother did not make any promise with the intent not to carry it out; (4) there was nothing to indicate that when the mother obtained a certificate of deposit and opened a money market account in her and the executrix's and the sister's names as joint tenants with right of survivorship, she meant to do anything other than that; and (5) the siblings did not raise the issue of a constructive trust in the condemnation proceedings and were collaterally estopped from raising the issue in a later action. Jenkins v. Jenkins, <cite class="ga_app_court">281 Ga. App. 756</cite>, <cite class="app_court">637 S.E.2d 56</cite> (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 87 (Ga. 2007).

       - In an action to recover property of an estate, when the administrator presented evidence that the decedent intended to divide the decedent's estate among the decedent's children equally and did not intend for the decedent's two youngest sons to have the funds in the joint accounts at the decedent's death, and also presented evidence of undue influence in the creation of the accounts, there was some evidence to overcome the presumption arising from O.C.G.A

       - Trial judge's determination that the decedent's lack of intention to make a gift of the funds to the decedent's daughter was established by clear and convincing evidence; thus, applying either O.C.G.A
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-813ol1a" target="_self">7-1-813(a)</a></cite> or pre-existing law, the trial judge was authorized to declare that the funds belonged to the estate. James v.

       Evidence showing that the decedent's daughter had suggested putting another name on the decedent's certificates of deposit "in case Mama got sick," provided clear and convincing support for the jury's determination that the decedent had added the daughter's name to the certificates for convenience rather than to effect a gift of the funds to the daughter. Turner v. Mikell, <cite class="ga_app_court">195 Ga. App. 766</cite>, <cite class="app_court">395 S.E.2d 20</cite> (1990).

       Since the decedent's expressed intent in establishing joint accounts was for the convenience of the decedent's niece in writing checks, paying bills and expenses, and handling the decedent's affairs during the decedent's illness, there was sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the niece, as surviving joint tenant, was entitled to the accounts.

       - After a decedent had given a power of attorney to the decedent's nephews, and created joint accounts with one of the nephews, while expressing a concern that someone have access to the decedent's money should the decedent become ill, but there was testimony that the decedent understood the effect of survivorship accounts, there existed a material issue regarding the decedents' intent, which created a jury question.

       In a dispute over a joint account created by a father, mother, and daughter, although only the father made contributions to the account, the daughter's contributions could include deposits made by him for her; because some evidence indicated an intent that the money would belong to the daughter, the trial court erred by concluding that all of the funds belonged to the mother after the father's death.

       - When the husband and wife died simultaneously there is no evidence, either "clear and convincing" or otherwise, which would authorize a finding that the husband did not intend for the wife to have a right of survivorship as to the joint bank accounts.

       - When the issue of the division of marital assets of a former husband and wife had not been resolved at the time of the husband's death, property acquired as a direct result of the labor and investments of the former husband during the course of the marriage was subject to equitable division in spite of the fact that it was titled in the former wife's name after the former husband's death as a matter of contract law.

       - In a dispute between an estate administratrix and the decedent's ex-spouse, the trial court did not err by granting the ex-spouse summary judgment as to the accounts that were jointly held with the decedent because their divorce settlement agreement did not address such accounts and Georgia law entitled the ex-spouse to the balance remaining.

       - When husband deposited in bank a sum of money belonging to himself, in name of his wife but with understanding that all or any part thereof might be withdrawn either by himself or by the wife, but by no one else, thus reserving to himself a free right of withdrawal, but giving to the wife the same right, the effect was to make a joint deposit with the conditions stated attached thereto. Had money been thus withdrawn by the wife or by the
   husband, the bank, under such conditions would in such disbursement have been protected against suit by a legal representative of the other; but when the deposit remained intact and nothing was withdrawn by either the husband or wife, both of whom subsequently died, title to such moneys vested jointly in the estates of the husband and wife.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Without qualifying any other statutory right to setoff or lien and subject to any contractual provision, if a party to a multiple-party account is indebted to a financial institution, the financial institution has a right to setoff against the account in which the party has or had immediately before his death a present right of withdrawal. The amount of the account subject to setoff is that proportion to which the debtor is or was immediately before his death beneficially entitled and, in the absence of proof of net contributions, an equal share with all parties having present rights of withdrawal.

       <p>
        - Under Georgia law, a contract allowing a bank a setoff of the bank's indebtedness to depositors against the depositors' indebtedness to the bank was not substantively unconscionable and the language in the agreement regarding arbitration was conspicuous so the provision was not procedurally unconscionable; thus, the arbitration clause was enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.

For purposes of this article, a mortgage loan originator shall be deemed to have been convicted of a crime if he or she has pleaded guilty to, been found guilty of, or entered a first offender or nolo contendere plea to a felony in a domestic, foreign, or military court; provided, however, that any pardon of a conviction shall not be a conviction.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the department has the discretion to examine a mortgage broker or mortgage lender less frequently, provided that its record of complaints, comments, or other information demonstrates that mortgage broker's or mortgage lender's ability to meet the standards of Code Sections 7-1-1003, 7-1-1003.2, and 7-1-1004. In the case of registrants, the department shall not be required to conduct such examinations if it determines that the registrant has been adequately examined by another bank regulatory agency.

The second 2019 amendment, effective July 1, 2019, deleted the paragraph (b)(1) designation and deleted former paragraph (b)(2), which read: "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the department may issue a notice of intent to suspend license to a mortgage loan originator when such mortgage loan originator is no longer sponsored by a licensed or registered mortgage broker or lender. If the mortgage loan originator is sponsored by a licensed or registered mortgage broker or lender within 30 days of the date of issuance of the notice of intent to suspend, such notice shall be rescinded. If the mortgage loan originator is not sponsored by a licensed or registered mortgage broker or lender within 30 days of the date of such issuance, the mortgage loan originator license shall automatically expire after 30 days and the person shall not act as a mortgage loan originator unless a new license application is submitted, all applicable fees are paid, and a license is issued by the department."

Such cease and desist order shall be final 20 days after it is issued unless the person to whom it is issued makes a written request within such 20 day period for a hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." A cease and desist order to an unlicensed person that orders such person to cease doing a mortgage business without the appropriate license shall be final 30 days from the date of issuance, and there shall be no opportunity for an administrative hearing.

     - Under Georgia law, public policy dictates that loans based partly on illegal consideration are void and money paid pursuant to such contracts need not be repaid, and since this is the same remedy as provided in this chapter for loans which violate it, the distinction between illegal loans and loans based in part on illegal consideration is of no importance.

     <p>
      Every licensee under this chapter may loan any sum of money not exceeding $3,000.00 for a period of 36 months and 15 days or less and may charge, contract for, collect, and receive interest and fees and may require the fulfillment of conditions on such loans as provided in this Code section:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol11">
       INTEREST. A licensee may charge, contract for, receive, and collect interest at a rate not to exceed 10 percent per annum of the face amount of the contract, whether repayable in one single payment or repayable in monthly or other periodic installments. On loan contracts repayable in 18 months or less, the interest may be discounted in advance; and, on contracts repayable over a greater period, the interest shall be added to the principal amount of the loan. On all contracts, interest or discount shall be computed proportionately on equal calendar months;
      </li>
      <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol12">
       LOAN FEE. In addition thereto, a licensee may charge, contract for, receive, or collect at the time the loan is made a fee in an amount not greater than 8 percent of the first $600.00 of the face amount of the contract plus 4 percent of the excess; provided, however, that such fee shall not be charged or collected on that part of a loan which is used to pay or apply on a prior loan or installment of a prior loan from the same licensee to the same borrower made within the immediately preceding six-month period; provided, however, if the loan balance is $300.00 or less, the said period shall be two months, not six months; provided, further, that nothing contained in this paragraph and paragraph (1) of this Code section shall be construed to permit charges, interest, or fees of any nature whatsoever in the aggregate in excess of the charges, interest, and fees which would constitute a violation of Code Section 7-4-18 and this chapter shall in no way affect Code Section 7-4-18. If a borrower prepays his or her entire loan to a licensee and within the following 15 days makes a new loan with that licensee and if this is done within the six-month period or the two-month period above described, as may be applicable, the fee may be charged only on the excess by which the face amount of the new contract exceeds the amount which the borrower repaid to that licensee within the said 15 day period;
      </li>
      <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol13">
       INSURANCE PREMIUMS. A licensee may charge and collect from the borrower premiums actually paid or to be paid for insurance obtained for the borrower. A licensee may accept as security on any loan or advance made under this chapter any one or any combination of the following:
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol13A">
         Insurance on tangible property against substantial risks or loss;
        </li>
        <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol13B">
         Reasonable insurance on the life and health of the principal party; or
        </li>
        <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol13C">
         Reasonable insurance against accident of the principal party;
         <p>
          provided, however, that any such insurance shall be reasonably related to the type and value of the property insured and to the amount and term of the loan and shall be obtained from an insurance company authorized to conduct such business in the State of Georgia and at rates lawfully filed by such company with the Commissioner of Insurance and through a regular insurance agent licensed by the Commissioner of Insurance; provided, further, the amount of life, health, or accident insurance required as security for loans made under this chapter shall not exceed the amount of the loan, including charges, to be secured; and the premiums on such insurance required of the principal party obligated shall be limited to premiums reasonably based upon reliable actuarial experience and sound insurance practice; and the Commissioner is authorized and directed to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate this provision in accordance with the spirit and intent thereof. It shall be the duty of the Commissioner from time to time under the foregoing direction, after public hearing in the manner provided in subsection (b) of Code Section 7-3-7, to determine and promulgate the rates and maximum premiums permissible to be charged for life, health, and accident insurance required as security for a loan made under this chapter and to make regulations incident thereto necessary to effectuate the same; such premiums, when thus established and as changed from time to time in the manner aforesaid, shall be the maximum effective and permissible charges under this paragraph. Premiums paid or to be paid pursuant to the authority of this paragraph shall not constitute interest. The insurance company in turn may pay to the party writing the insurance policy sold in connection with the loan a fee or commission in an amount which is reasonable in relationship to the transaction and in no event in excess of the amount of fee or commission customarily paid within the industry where comparable insurance is sold in a transaction not involving credit, as determined by the Commissioner;

      </li>
      <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol14">
       LATE CHARGE. A licensee may charge and collect from the borrower a late or delinquent charge of $10.00 or an amount equal to 5› for each $1.00 of any installment which is not paid within five days from the date such payment is due, whichever is greater, provided that this late or delinquent charge shall not be collected more than once for the same default; and
      </li>
      <li id="t07c03s7-3-14ol15">
       MAINTENANCE CHARGE. In addition thereto, a licensee may contract for, charge, receive, and collect a maintenance charge of $3.00 for each month in the term of the loan contract on each loan made, whether repayable in one single payment or repayable in weekly, monthly, or other periodic installments. Refunds of unearned maintenance charges shall be made in accordance with the method prescribed in Code Section 7-3-17, and such maintenance charges will be subject to paragraph (4) of this Code section. Nothing contained in Code Section 7-4-18, as now or hereafter amended, shall be construed to apply to this paragraph; and loans made in conformity with this paragraph shall in no way constitute a violation of Code Section 7-4-18, as now or hereafter amended.

       - In enacting O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c03s7-3-14" target="_self">7-3-14</a></cite>, the General Assembly was concerned with the possible exorbitant and unmerited exaction of profits by the original lender in a renewal or refinancing. Although there is nothing to indicate that the General Assembly specifically considered the "anti-competition" problem, the clear thrust and underlying policy of this legislation is to provide some protection to debtors in small loan transactions, while there is no indication that solicitude for second lenders was even a minor policy consideration.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c03s7-3-1" target="_self">7-3-1</a></cite> et seq.) is to define and prevent usury. One consideration underlying the usury laws is that a creditor should not avail oneself of the necessitous condition of one's debtor to exact
   burdensome and oppressive terms. Securities Inv. Co. v. Pearson, <cite class="ga_app_court">111 Ga. App. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">143 S.E.2d 36</cite> (1965).

USA Payday Cash Advance Ctrs. v. Oxendine, <cite class="ga_app_court">262 Ga. App. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">585 S.E.2d 924</cite> (2003).

       - In a class action suit seeking to hold a lender liable for payday loans, the trial court did not err in concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the lender was the true lender of the loans made after May 14, 2004, because evidence was presented sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the lender actually received only a 49 percent economic interest for the lender's services and even if the lender did so, whether the lender nevertheless, by contrivance, device, or scheme, attempted to avoid the provisions of O.C.G.A.

         Rule of 78's applicable in refinancing situation.

       <p>
        - One statute the General Assembly has written to allow for use of the Rule of 78's in situations involving the prepayment of all or any part of the unpaid balance of an installment contract prior to maturity should be held applicable when a borrower retires one note held by a particular lender by using the proceeds of a second note from the same lender. The General Assembly's decision to allow more than a pro rata loss of interest in prepayment situations indicates the General Assembly's desire to allow a similar loss by the borrower in a refinancing situation since both transactions are initiated by the borrower and are evidences of the borrower's failure to fulfill the borrower's contractual obligation to repay the lender pursuant to the initial installment contract. That failure has caused the General Assembly to exact a penalty against the borrower in the form of allowing a creditor's use of the Rule of 78's in a prepayment situation, and in the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, the same penalty should be exacted against the refinancing borrower. Simpson v. Termplan, Inc., 535 F. Supp. 36 (N.D. Ga. 1981). (But see, Ford v. Termplan, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981)).

    - Usury statute in effect at the time a loan is secured is no defense to an action by the creditor to secure repayment of the debt when the usury statute is repealed before the defense of usury is raised. Fountain v. Dixie Fin. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">252 Ga. 543</cite>, <cite class="app_court">314 S.E.2d 906</cite> (1984).

         Four requisites of usurious transactions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - There are four requisites of every usurious transaction: (1) a loan or forebearance of money, either express or implied; (2) upon understanding that principal shall or may be returned; (3) that for such loan or forebearance a greater profit than is authorized by law shall be paid or is agreed to be paid; and (4) that the contract was made with intent to violate the law.

       - It is duty of court to look, not at form and words, but at substance of transaction. Rushing v.

         Usurious original transaction infects renewal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Contract for usurious loan not purged of usury by renewal note when original contract continues. Hammond v. Buys, <cite class="ga_court">1 Ga. 416</cite> (1846).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If there was usury in the original loan which was not purged out when renewal was given, they are contaminated just as original contract was, and all payments made in interval are to be treated not as payments of usury, but payments made on original debt. Archer v. McCray, <cite class="ga_court">59 Ga. 546</cite> (1877); McGee v. Long, <cite class="ga_court">83 Ga. 156</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E. 1107</cite> (1889); Lockwood v. Muhlberg, <cite class="ga_court">124 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E. 92</cite> (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When original transaction was usurious, the usury infects any renewal note for the same debt or any part thereof, if the usury was never purged. Hartsfield Co. v. Watkins, <cite class="ga_app_court">67 Ga. App. 411</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E.2d 440</cite> (1942).

         Usurious contract not cured by compromise and settlement for less.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since usury consists not only in reserving and taking but in contracting to reserve and take more than legal rate, fact that agreed excess was compromised and settled for a less amount would not free a transaction from usury.

       - When facts show without dispute a device to extract more than legal rate of interest for use of money, such question need not be submitted to the jury. Accordingly, when undisputed pleadings show such a scheme, it is not error for the trial court to grant the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings under provisions of

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Purpose of the statute against usury is, at most, only a check on the conscience of the lender. The necessity to borrow on one hand, and greed on the other, prompted the legislature, no doubt, to fix from time to time a limit on the value of money. This value is merely arbitrary in the legislative mind. Green v. Equitable Mtg. Co., <cite class="ga_court">107 Ga. 536</cite>, <cite class="app_court">33 S.E. 869</cite> (1899).

         Distinction between legal interest and lawful interest.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Generally, the terms legal interest and lawful interest have different meanings. The former means exact rate of interest named in statute, while latter means anything up to maximum rate which law allows. Daniel v. Gibson, <cite class="ga_court">72 Ga. 367</cite>, 53 Am. R. 845 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Legal interest rates are prima facie "equitable"
       
       and any award deviating from the legal rates must be based on sufficient evidence demonstrating that another rate is appropriate. Atlantic States Constr., Inc. v. Beavers, <cite class="ga_app_court">169 Ga. App. 584</cite>, <cite class="app_court">314 S.E.2d 245</cite> (1984).

        Promise of liberal interest will not justify more than the legal interest.

         Postdefault interest rate higher than predefault interest rate.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In a suit by a lender on a note and guaranties, the note's postdefault interest rate was only three percent higher than the predefault rate of five percent, so the total rate of eight percent per year was well within the legal limit of 60 percent and was permissible under O.C.G.A.

        These provisions apply to counties,
       
       as well as to individuals. A county is bound to pay eight percent interest when that rate is specified in writing, if there is compliance with all other legal requirements.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In a suit challenging the bank's overdraft fees, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in certifying the class because the legality of fees required the examination of a common set of terms in identical form contracts that applied to all members of the putative class as the claims arising from an interpretation of form agreements were classic cases for treatment as a class action.

        - Law recognizes a seller's right to make a difference in the seller's cash price and the seller's time price for the seller's property; and, though in a given instance this difference may exceed the maximum allowable rate, usury laws are not applicable. If, however, property is sold at a cash price, and time is given by vendor to purchaser upon a portion of the purchase money, and a greater rate of interest than that allowed by law is charged on such deferred payments, the contract is usurious.

       - Former Civil Code 1910,

        - Taint of usury does not result from payment of usurious interest, but from agreement to do so, whether performed or unperformed. Duderwicz v. Sweetwater Sav. Ass'n, 595 F.2d 1008 (5th Cir. 1979).

        Once there is usury, the usury infects any renewal note
       
       for the same debt or any part thereof unless the usury is purged. A determination as to the application of former O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c04s7-4-7" target="_self">7-4-7</a></cite>, which provided for no limit of interest rate on loans of $100,000.00 or more, cannot be decided without a complete accounting to purge all usurious interest (to be applied to principal, if paid) and then a determination made as to whether or not the principal of the original note was for $100,000 or more, which would insulate it against the defense of usury. McNair v. Gold Kist, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 782</cite>, <cite class="app_court">305 S.E.2d 478</cite> (1983).

        <p>
       - Before a borrower who has executed a deed infected with usury can have affirmative equitable relief, such as injunction to prevent exercise of power of sale by grantee in such security deed, the borrower must pay or tender to the grantee the principal sum due.

       Since interest only is subject to forfeiture, principal amount of indebtedness must be tendered before equity will intervene to prevent foreclosure sale. Citizens &amp; S.S. DeKalb Bank v.

       <p>

       Defense of usury is personal to debtor,
      
      and may not be urged save by borrower or borrower's privies. Clark v. Kaiser Agric. Chems., <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 251</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1980); Plowden v. Peoples Fin. Corp. (In re Pair), 14 Bankr. 732 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plea of usury is personal and because the usury laws protect the debtor, not the debt, the parties' various rights concerning the debt belongs to them only so long as they remain within a lender-borrower relationship. Lindenberg v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 528 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 691 F.2d 974 (11th Cir. 1982).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Usury is a defense and need not be asserted as a counterclaim or in separate suit. Williams v. First Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga. App. 879</cite>, <cite class="app_court">269 S.E.2d 923</cite> (1980).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Defense of usury is a matter personal to the debtor and, before the debtor has made such defense, the debtor's obligation to pay the indebtedness infected with usury is prima facie valid. Napier v. Jordan, <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 585</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E. 854</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Borrower cannot use usury statute to take advantage of own wrong.
       
       Eiberger v. West, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 767</cite>, <cite class="app_court">281 S.E.2d 148</cite> (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Estoppel can lie to bar defense of usury.
       
       Eiberger v. West, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 767</cite>, <cite class="app_court">281 S.E.2d 148</cite> (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Failure to plead usury results in an estoppel to rely upon it as a defense. Clark v. Kaiser Agric. Chems., <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 251</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        One failing to set up defense of usury is concluded by judgment.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Debtor who has had the debtor's day in court will not be heard to attack levy of execution on ground that the debt was infected with usury. Wilkinson v. Holton, <cite class="ga_court">119 Ga. 557</cite>, <cite class="app_court">46 S.E. 620</cite> (1904); Clark v. Kaiser Agric. Chems., <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Fact that after creditor has advertised property for sale for payment of a usurious debt, the debtor, in a bill in equity to enjoin sale, sets up usury and shows that the debtor has paid all that the debtor was legally liable for, and obtains a judgment against the creditor for an amount which debtor overpaid, does not so relate as to give any tortious character to the creditor's original act in advertising property for sale. Napier v. Jordan, <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 585</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E. 854</cite> (1936).

       <p>
        <p>
       - While plea of usury is a personal one which can be set up by a debtor only, when the debtor is insolvent and there is a fund in court to be distributed, equity will allow one creditor to suggest usury as to claim of another, and compel usurious creditor to write off usury and receive only principal and legal interest. Stone v. Georgia Loan &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">107 Ga. 524</cite>, <cite class="app_court">33 S.E. 861</cite> (1899).
       </p>
       <p>

   §
   2878 petitioning creditors in bankruptcy may attack validity of deed by which alleged bankrupt has conveyed to another creditor a valuable part of the bankrupt's estate on the ground that it was usurious, and the court of bankruptcy has power to enjoin the sale of property by the grantee pending adjudication of the question.

        <p>
       - One obtaining money judgment in lower court, who unsuccessfully appeals one's favorable judgment, is entitled to interest on one's judgment during the pendency of the appeal. Henley v.

        Filing of garnishment proceedings
       
       by the judgment creditor during the pendency of an appeal by the debtor did not toll the accrual of post-judgment interest, even if the garnishee paid the funds into the court. Great S.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a claim for principal judgment debt interest arises in a later-filed garnishment action, it is more akin to a request for prejudgment interest because the judgment creditor seeks to recover interest running from before the trial court enters judgment in the garnishment action and, in fact, from before the garnishment action was even commenced.

   §
   1/HB 221, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "The General Assembly finds and declares that it is important to assess periodically child support guidelines and determine whether existing guidelines continue to be viable and effective or whether they have failed or ceased to accomplish their original policy objectives. The General Assembly further finds that supporting Georgia's children is vitally important to the citizens of Georgia. Therefore, the General Assembly has determined that it is in the best interests of the state and its citizenry to undertake an evaluation of the child support guidelines on a continuing basis. The General Assembly declares that it is important that all of Georgia's children are provided with adequate financial support whether the children's parents are living together or not living together. The General Assembly finds that both parents have a continuing obligation with respect to providing financial and emotional stability for their child or children. It is the hope of the members of the General Assembly that all parents work together to advance the best interest of their children."

       - Trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Office of Child Support enforcement, was upheld on appeal in a class action suit brought by a recipient challenging the department's failure to collect post-judgment interest on unpaid child support since a statement of understanding, though stating it was a contract, afforded complete discretion to the department in rendering services and used the vague term appropriate services, which rendered the purported agreement too vague and uncertain to be enforced as a contract.

        <p>
       - When a promissory note is both executed and to be performed in another state, in an attack by the maker upon a note for usury, in an action brought in this state against the maker by the holder, when laws of the foreign states regulating interest charges and usury do not appear, the common law will be presumed to be there in force, and the right to collect interest in such suit, unless contrary to public policy or specific statutes of this state, will be governed by common law as it has been construed and applied in this state. Folsom v. Continental Adjustment Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 435</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 833</cite> (1934).

       <p>
        - Parties are free to bargain away their rights, and once the borrower is released from liability, whether by novation, a loan modification, or any other means, subsequent agreements for repayments of the debt are governed by the laws as of the date they are made, and not the date of the creation of the debt. Lindenberg v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 528 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ga. 1981), aff'd, 691 F.2d 974 (11th Cir. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Transactions involving the assumption of home loan obligations, the release of borrowers, and the substitution of new parties at escalated interest rates resulted in new contracts, notwithstanding that the loan modification agreements were not intended to be novations; so the date of the loan assumptions, rather than the original date of the notes, controlled the applicable usury rates.

       - When money is paid by mistake, and there is no fraud or misconduct by the party receiving the money, interest does not run until after demand, since prior to demand, by suit or otherwise, the receiver is in no default. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams Hosp. v. Nisbet, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 821</cite>, <cite class="app_court">14 S.E.2d 64</cite> (1941).

       In a condemnation action, the property owner was properly awarded prejudgment interest on the purchase price on a second parcel because the price was fixed, certain, and ascertainable under the terms of the parties' contract such that the debt owed by the county was liquidated and subject to prejudgment interest under O.C.G.A.

       Trial court did not err by awarding the lottery player prejudgment interest because the player's demand for interest was sufficient to be considered a demand for prejudgment interest under O.C.G.A.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Liquidation is an amount certain and fixed, either by act and agreement of parties, or by operation of law; a sum which cannot be changed by proof; it is so much or nothing; and the term does not necessarily refer to a writing. Nisbet v. Lawson, <cite class="ga_court">1 Ga. 275</cite> (1846); Council v. Hixon, <cite class="ga_app_court">11 Ga. App. 818</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E. 603</cite> (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        A liquidated demand is an amount certain and fixed . . . a sum which cannot be changed by proof. GECC v. Strickle Properties, 861 F.2d 1532 (11th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A liquidated sum is an amount certain and fixed, either by the act and agreement of the parties or by operation of law; a sum which cannot be changed by the proof; it is so much or nothing. Great Am. Ins. Co. v. International Ins. Co., 753 F. Supp. 357 (M.D. Ga. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Liquidated claim is for an amount certain and fixed. International Indem. Co. v. Terrell, <cite class="ga_app_court">178 Ga. App. 570</cite>, <cite class="app_court">344 S.E.2d 239</cite> (1986); American Family Life Assurance Co. v. United States Fire Co., 885 F.2d 826 (11th Cir. 1989); Tower Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">204 Ga. App. 910</cite>, <cite class="app_court">423 S.E.2d 257</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">204 Ga. App. 922</cite>, <cite class="app_court">423 S.E.2d 257</cite> (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Liquidated damages were damages that were in an amount that were certain and fixed, and since the trial court did not have before the court such evidence, the court erred in determining that the damages in the contract between the services provider and the corporation were liquidated, and entering a corresponding judgment. Mitchell v. Gilwil Group, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">261 Ga. App. 882</cite>, <cite class="app_court">583 S.E.2d 911</cite> (2003).
       </p>
       <p>

        - Fair rule to be applied in building contracts is to ascertain the stated debt due at a certain time and deduct therefrom a reasonable amount for remedying defects.

       Because account invoices sued upon by two contractors represented obligations for the payment of money arising out of transactions to furnish labor and materials, none of which involved a retail installment transaction, and involved liquidated claims, the trial court did not err in determining that those accounts were commercial accounts. Thus, an award of prejudgment interest as to the amounts owed was upheld on appeal. Hampshire Homes, Inc. v. Espinosa Constr. Servs., <cite class="ga_app_court">288 Ga.

       Subcontractor was entitled to recover from an insurer on a payment bond because a pay-when-paid clause in a contract of the contractor and subcontractor could not be used as a defense by the insurer when the insurer denied the subcontractor a federal remedy under the Miller Act.

       - When the sums owed to the subcontractor's supplier arose out of the furnishing of goods to the subcontractor on the project, not out of the furnishing of goods by the supplier to the general contractor, the supplier's action against the general contractor and the surety on the lien bond was not based on a commercial account with the subcontractor but on the supplier's rights under the lien bond - that is, the supplier's rights as a lien claimant.
   Accordingly, the general contractor's liability did not arise out of failure to pay the amounts owed to the supplier on a commercial account, and O.C.G.A.

       When the creditor made no attempt to collect interest on the overdue account prior to filing suit, but alleged in the creditor's complaint that the creditor was entitled to interest, there was no error in permitting evidence concerning the accrual of interest on the indebtedness or in charging the provisions of O.C.G.A.

       - When evidence in an action against a defendant-farmer on open account indicated that the plaintiff was basing the plaintiff's estimation of the defendant's indebtedness on the business records of another corporation it had purchased and the defendant denied indebtedness in the amount claimed by the plaintiff, and since the plaintiff's affidavit failed to establish the defendant's account to be a commercial one authorizing a certain annual finance charge pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of a debtor on all of the invoices that made up a creditor's claim against the debtor on the ground that the complaint was barred by the four-year limitation period for a suit on account because the trial court's grant of summary judgment was based on a purported admission by the creditor that its claims accrued on April 3, 2001, but the trial court misread the document, and the creditor submitted authenticated invoices, which showed dates more recent than four years prior to the date suit was filed; unless otherwise provided in the agreement, claims are barred if the claims are asserted more than four years after invoices are submitted to the buyer.

      When a payment is made upon any debt, it shall be applied first to the discharge of any interest due at the time, and the balance, if any, shall be applied to the reduction of the principal. If the payment does not extinguish the interest then due, no interest shall be calculated on such balance of interest and interest shall be calculated only on the principal amount up to the time of the next payment.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since former Code 1910,
   §
   3433 was for the benefit of creditor, it did not seem that the debtor could be heard to complain on account of interest-bearing principal having been reduced, with a consequent reduction to the debtor of the indebtedness, by application of the entire payment to principal instead of first extinguishing accrued interest. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co. v. Friedlander Bros., <cite class="ga_app_court">30 Ga.

         Creditor may apply payment made before interest is due to reduction of principal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When payment was made by the debtor, before interest was due on principal of debt, and the debtor did not direct that payment be applied to any particular claim, the creditor had the right to apply the payment to reduction of the principal of the debt. Massell Realty Co. v. Chamberlin, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 718</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 311</cite> (1933).

       <p>
        <p>

        In the case of a demand note,
       
       no time for payment is expressed; therefore, no interest would be due until payment is demanded. Unless the debtor has stipulated otherwise, the creditor has the right to apply any payments to the reduction of the principal of the debt when no interest was due at the time of payment. Spillers v. First S. Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">185 Ga. App. 580</cite>, <cite class="app_court">365 S.E.2d 151</cite> (1988).

         Right to recover interest after payment of principal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - It is the general rule that the right to recover interest after payment of principal sum due depends upon whether interest is due by terms of the contract, or whether it is merely an implied incident to the debt and is allowed by way of damages. If it is due by terms of the contract, payment of principal is no bar to a subsequent recovery of interest, but if it is not due by such terms, payment of principal sum is generally a bar to recovery, except that when the obligation is one which by statute bears interest, this is taken as an equivalent contractual obligation to pay interest, and in such a case payment of entire principal does not defeat subsequent recovery of accrued interest. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co. v. Friedlander Bros., <cite class="ga_app_court">30 Ga. App. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">117 S.E. 762</cite> (1923), aff 'd, <cite class="ga_court">158 Ga. 303</cite>, <cite class="app_court">122 S.E. 890</cite> (1924).

       County's payment to landowners who were awarded $ 16.5 million in a condemnation action was not sufficient to pay principal and interest on the judgment the landowners obtained, and the appellate court held that the landowners were entitled to collect post-judgment interest on the amount which the county still owed.

       - There is no statutory requirement that credit for proceeds must be applied to attorney fees first. Presumably, this matter is one which may be contractually agreed to by the parties.

       Attorney was authorized by statute to charge interest at the rate charged and to apply the client's payments first to the interest due and then to the principal. At all times, the client could have avoided any obligation to pay interest by paying the principal in full each month as the client agreed to do. Cooney v. Rowland, <cite class="ga_app_court">240 Ga.

       - Trial court did not err in granting a lender's motion for summary judgment because the doctrine of res judicata barred a debtor's suit alleging that the lender incorrectly charged interest on the debtor's unsecured revolving line of credit; the same matters were already litigated between the same parties in an action previously adjudicated on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction.

        Despite the decision in Johnson v. Fleet Finance, Inc., 785 F. Supp. 1003 (S.D. Ga. 1992), the bankruptcy court disagreed that "per month" implied a monthly average, stating that the legislature required that a criminal usury analysis be on a "per month" basis; however, since the most recent expression of the law by the district court specifically overruled a prior decision of a bankruptcy court within the district, Johnson, supra, the bankruptcy court was bound by that district court decision.

       - When profit received by money lender, by whatever name it may be called, and whether lawful on its face or not, is in reality a contrivance or device to obtain amount greater than lawful interest, and is made with intent to violate usury laws, the transaction is illegal, and name by which it is called is altogether immaterial.

       - Line of credit arrangement accessed through special drafts drawn on the lender which the borrower may make payable to a third party is clearly governed by the Lender Credit Card Act. The drafts are "lender credit cards" within the meaning of former
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-3ol12" target="_self">7-5-3(2)</a></cite> since the drafts constitute "credit confirmation or identification." 1985 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 85-32 (decided under former

       <p>
        <p>
       When the financial institution issues special drafts which the borrower may make payable only to the issuing financial institution and to draw on the line of credit, the borrower must either come back to the financial institution and cash one of the drafts or deposit the draft into the borrower's checking account at the financial institution and then use the borrower's personal check drawn on the borrower's deposit account, the third party would have no reason to know that a credit transaction was transpiring. Thus, lacking the requisite "credit confirmation or identification," it would not be governed by the Lender Credit Card Act, but, rather, would be governed by Georgia's usury provisions found at O.C.G.A.
   §

       When the drawee bank extends a line of credit to the customer against which the customer may draw by writing checks that would otherwise overdraw the drawee's checking account, because the customer's checks do not indicate the customer has overdraft protection nor is the customer given any article which the customer could present to a third party to give notification of overdraft protection, this arrangement would be governed by Georgia's general usury provisions rather than the Lender Credit Card Act. 1985 Op.

       No creditor may knowingly or intentionally engage in the unfair act or practice of "flipping" a home loan. Flipping a home loan is the consummating of a high-cost home loan to a borrower that refinances an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior five years when the new loan does not provide reasonable, tangible net benefit to the borrower considering all of the circumstances including, but not limited to, the terms of both the new and refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan, and the borrower's circumstances.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c6As7-6A-4ol1b">
       The home loan refinancing transaction shall be presumed to be a flipping where a high-cost home loan refinances an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior five years and that is a special mortgage originated, subsidized, or guaranteed by or through a state, tribal, or local government or a nonprofit organization, which either bears a below-market interest rate at the time the loan was originated or has nonstandard payment terms beneficial to the borrower, such as payments that vary with income, are limited to a percentage of income, or where no payments are required under specified conditions and where, as a result of the refinancing, the borrower will lose one or more of the benefits of the special mortgage. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this chapter, home loan refinancing transactions of first mortgage loans originated by, purchased by, or assigned to the Georgia Housing and Finance Authority shall not be presumed to be a flipping under this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c6As7-6A-4ol1c">
       Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this chapter regarding costs and attorneys' fees, in any action instituted by a borrower who alleges that the defendant violated this Code section, the borrower shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees only if the presiding judge, in the judge's discretion, allows reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the borrower as prevailing party, such fees and costs to be taxed as a part of the court costs and payable by the losing party upon a finding by the presiding judge that the party charged with the violation has willfully engaged in the act or practice and there was unwarranted refusal by such party to fully resolve the matter which constitutes the basis of such action.

       Without regard to whether a borrower is acting individually or on behalf of others similarly situated, any provision of a high-cost home loan agreement that allows a party to require a borrower to assert any claim or defense in a forum that is less convenient, more costly, or more dilatory for the resolution of a dispute than a judicial forum established in this state where the borrower may otherwise properly bring the claim or defense or limits in any way any claim or defense the borrower may have is unconscionable and void;
      </li>

       A creditor shall not make a high-cost home loan without first receiving certification from a counselor with a third-party nonprofit organization approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Georgia Housing and Finance Authority that the borrower has received counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction. No creditor, servicer, or its institution shall be required to contribute to the funding of any nonprofit organization that provides counseling required pursuant to this paragraph;

There is a rebuttable presumption that the borrower residing in the home is able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, said borrower's total monthly debts, including amounts under the loan, do not exceed 50 percent of said borrower's monthly gross income as verified by tax returns, payroll receipts, and other third-party income verification;

When tender is not required by the court, upon application to the court by the creditor, the court shall require the borrower to pay into the registry of the court all regularly scheduled home loan payments including property taxes and homeowners hazard insurance premiums if required by escrow agreement which are the responsibility of the borrower payable to the creditor or servicer under the terms of the home loan agreement which become due after the filing of the legal action, said home loan payments to be paid as such become due, and such other expenses provided under the home loan agreement as the court may deem just, provided that regularly scheduled payments shall not include any payments allegedly due under any acceleration provision of the home loan.

That part of the funds which is a matter of controversy in the litigation shall remain in the registry of the court until a determination of the issues by the trial court.
