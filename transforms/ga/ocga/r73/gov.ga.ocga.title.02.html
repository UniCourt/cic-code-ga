       2-2-11. Inspection warrants.
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the Constitution or laws of the United States or the State of Georgia require the issuance of a warrant to make an inspection under any law administered by the Commissioner of Agriculture or the Department of Agriculture, the procedure set forth in paragraphs (1) through (7) of this Code section shall be employed.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t02c02s2-2-11ol11">
       The Commissioner or any person authorized to make inspections for the Commissioner shall make application for an inspection warrant to a person who is a judicial officer within the meaning of Code Section 17-5-21.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c02s2-2-11ol12">
       An inspection warrant shall be issued only upon cause and when supported by an affidavit particularly describing the place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected and the purpose for which the inspection is to be made. In addition, the affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Cause shall be deemed to exist if either reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle, or there is reason to believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c02s2-2-11ol13">
       An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified therein, but not for a period of more than 14 days, unless extended or renewed by the judicial officer who signed and issued the original warrant, upon satisfying himself that such extension or renewal is in the public interest. Such inspection warrant must be executed and returned to the judicial officer by whom it was issued within the time specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the expiration of such time, the warrant, unless executed, is void.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c02s2-2-11ol14">
       An inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant shall be made between 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. of any day or at any time during operating or regular business hours. An inspection should not be performed in the absence of an owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle unless specifically authorized by the judicial officer upon a showing that such authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the regulation being enforced. An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible entry where facts are shown which are sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a violation of this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department, which, if such violation existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful. Where prior consent has been sought and refused and a warrant has been issued, the warrant may be executed without further notice to the owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c02s2-2-11ol15">
       It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to allow an inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant issued as provided in this Code section. Any person violating this paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c02s2-2-11ol16">
       Under this Code section, an inspection warrant is an order, in writing, signed by a judicial officer, directed to the Commissioner or any person authorized to make inspections for the Commissioner, and commanding him or her to conduct any inspection required or authorized by this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department or regulations promulgated pursuant to this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c02s2-2-11ol17">
       Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require an inspection warrant when a warrantless inspection is authorized by law or a permit issued under this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department.

The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided in subsection (n) of this Code section for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall mature at such times and bear interest at such rates as may be determined by the authority, payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds.

       The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company inside or outside the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest.

       In case any officer whose signature appears on any bonds or whose facsimile signature appears on any coupon ceases to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman or vice chairman of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary or assistant secretary of the authority; and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairman or vice chairman of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person, and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office.

The resolution or indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. The resolution or indenture may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued.

       It is recognized and declared:
       <ol>
        <li id="t02c06s2-6-2ol1a1">
         That the soil resources and fertility of the land of this state and the economic use thereof, the prosperity of the farming population of this state, the navigability of the rivers and harbors of this state, and the prevention of floods in this state are matters affected with a public interest;

        <li id="t02c06s2-6-2ol1a2">
         That the welfare of this state has been impaired and is in danger of being further impaired by destruction of its soil fertility, by uneconomic use and waste of its land, by exploitation and wasteful and unscientific use of its soil resources, by floods and impairment of its rivers and harbors and of the navigability of its waters and water courses as a result of soil erosion, and by the decrease in the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms in the state as compared with the net income per person in the state not on farms;
        </li>
        <li id="t02c06s2-6-2ol1a3">
         That such evils have been augmented and are likely to be augmented by similar conditions in other states and are so interrelated with such conditions in other states that the remedying of such conditions in this state requires action by this state in cooperation with the governments and agencies of other states and of the United States and requires assistance therein by the government and agencies of the United States; and

         That the formulation and effectuation by this state of state plans in conformity with Section 7 of the federal Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act is calculated to remedy such conditions and will tend to advance the public welfare of this state.

       Therefore, in order to promote the welfare of the people of this state by aiding in the preservation and improvement of soil fertility, in the promotion of the economic use and conservation of land, in the diminution of exploitation and wasteful and unscientific use of soil resources, in the protection of rivers and harbors against the results of soil erosion, and in the reestablishment, at as rapid a rate as is practicable and in the general public interest, of the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms and that of the net income per person not on farms that prevailed during the five-year period beginning August, 1909, and ending July, 1914, as determined from statistics available in the United States Department of Agriculture, and the maintenance of such ratio, this state assents to and accepts the federal Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and adopts the policy and purpose of cooperating with the government and agencies of other states and of the United States in the accomplishment of the policy and purposes specified in Section 7 of such act, subject, however, to the following limitations:

         Such powers shall not be used to discourage the production of supplies of foods and fibers in this state which are sufficient, when taken together with the production thereof in other states of the United States, to maintain normal domestic human consumption, as determined by the secretary of agriculture of the United States from the records of consumption in the years 1920 to 1929, inclusive, taking into consideration increased population, quantities of any commodities that were forced into domestic consumption by a decline in exports of particular commodities, and the quantities of substitutes available for domestic consumption within any general class of food commodities; and

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of this article is to regulate, in the public interest, the labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, use, and disposal of pesticides. The General Assembly finds that pesticides are valuable to this state's agricultural production and to the protection of man and the environment from insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be pests but that it is essential to the public health and welfare that they be regulated to prevent adverse effects on human life and on the environment. New pesticides which are valuable to the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, and plant regulators are continually being discovered or synthesized. The dissemination of accurate scientific information as to the proper use of any pesticide is vital to the public health and welfare and to the environment, both immediately and in the future. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of such pesticides.

     <p>
      The purpose of this article is to regulate, in the public interest, the use and application of pesticides to control pests, as defined in this article. Pesticides perform a valuable role by:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-91ol11">
       Controlling insects, fungi, nematodes, rodents, and other pests which ravage and destroy our supply of food and fiber, which serve as vectors of disease, and which otherwise constitute a nuisance in the environment or the home;
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-91ol12">
       Controlling weeds which compete in the production of food and fiber and which otherwise are unwanted elements in our environment; and
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-91ol13">
       Regulating plant growth to enhance both the quantity and quality of our supply of food and fiber and to facilitate its harvest.
       <p>
        New pesticides are continually being discovered, synthesized, or developed which are valuable for the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, and related purposes. However, such pesticides may be ineffective, may cause injury to man, or may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment if not properly used. Pesticides may injure man or animals, either by direct poisoning or by gradual accumulation of pesticide residues in the tissues. Crops or other plants may also be injured by the improper use of pesticides. The drifting or washing of pesticides into streams or lakes may cause appreciable damage to aquatic life. A pesticide applied for the purpose of killing pests in a crop which is not itself injured by the pesticide may drift and injure other crops or nontarget organisms with which it comes in contact. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of the use and application of such pesticides.

     <p>
      The Pest Control Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein. The compact is substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <div>
      <h5>
       PEST CONTROL COMPACT
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       ARTICLE I. FINDINGS.
      </h5>
      <p>
       The party states find that:
      </p>
      <ol class="alpha">
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1a">
        In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this compact, the annual loss of approximately 25 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1b">
        Because of varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1c">
        The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another, to complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1d">
        While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crop and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an Insurance Fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interests, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.
        <p>
         As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:
        </p>
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1e">
        "Insurance Fund" means the Pest Control Insurance Fund established pursuant to this compact.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1f">
        "Governing Board" means the administrators of this compact representing all of the party states when such administrators are acting as a body in pursuance of authority vested in them by this compact.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1g">
        "Executive Committee" means the committee established pursuant to Article V (e) of this compact.
        <p>
         There is hereby established the Pest Control Insurance Fund for the purpose of financing other than normal pest control operations which states may be called upon to engage in pursuant to this compact. The Insurance Fund shall contain monies appropriated to it by the party states and any donations and grants accepted by it. All appropriations, except as conditioned by the rights and obligations of party states expressly set forth in this compact, shall be unconditional and may not be restricted by the appropriating state to use in the control of any specified pest or pests. Donations and grants may be conditional or unconditional, provided that the Insurance Fund shall not accept any donation or grant whose terms are inconsistent with any provision of this compact.

       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1h">
        The Governing Board shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of the business of the Insurance Fund and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The Insurance Fund shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1i">
        The Insurance Fund annually shall make to the Governor and legislature of each party state a report covering its activities for the preceding year. The Insurance Fund may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c07s2-7-130ol1j">
        In addition to the powers and duties specifically authorized and imposed, the Insurance Fund may do such other things as are necessary and incidental to the conduct of its affairs pursuant to this compact.
        <p>
         1. Assist in the coordination of activities pursuant to the compact in his state; and
        </p>
        <p>
         2. Represent his state on the Governing Board of the Insurance Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         1. The maintenance of pest control and eradication activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of this compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         2. The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been done in the absence of this compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         1. A detailed statement of the circumstances which occasion the request for the invoking of the compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         2. Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.
        </p>
        <p>
         3. A statement of the extent of the present and projected program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefor, in connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of introduction of the pest concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
         4. Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         5. A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the invoking of the compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of monies from the Insurance Fund in one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         6. Such other information as the Governing Board may require consistent with the provisions of this compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Governing Board may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its functions. Any such advisory or technical committee, or any member or members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations. Upon request of the Governing Board or Executive Committee an advisory or technical committee may furnish information and recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from the Insurance Fund being considered by such Board or Committee and the Board or Committee may receive and consider the same: provided that any participant in a meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of the compact shall be entitled to know the substance of any such information and recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto or as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at which the Governing Board or Executive Committee makes its disposition of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
         This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

      </p>
      <p>
       The members of the Governing Board shall be entitled to one vote each on such Board. No action of the Governing Board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the Governing Board are cast in favor thereof. Action of the Governing Board shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the members are present.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Insurance Fund shall have a seal which may be employed as an official symbol and which may be affixed to documents and otherwise used as the Governing Board may provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governing Board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman, a secretary and a treasurer. The chairman may not succeed himself. The Governing Board may appoint an executive director and fix his duties and his compensation, if any. Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the Governing Board. The Governing Board shall make provision for the bonding of such of the officers and employees of the Insurance Fund as may be appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>

       RTICLE V. COMPACT AND INSURANCE FUND ADMINISTRATION.
      </p>
      <p>
       In each party state there shall be a compact administrator, who shall be selected and serve in such manner as the laws of his state may provide, and who shall:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefor within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the Governing Board of the Insurance Fund by not to exceed three representatives. Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, but no such representative shall have a vote on the Governing Board or on the Executive Committee thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governing Board shall meet at least once each year for the purpose of determining policies and procedures in the administration of the Insurance Fund and, consistent with the provisions of the compact, supervising and giving direction to the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund. Additional meetings of the Governing Board shall be held on call of the chairman, the Executive Committee, or a majority of the membership of the Governing Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       At such times as it may be meeting, the Governing Board shall pass upon applications for assistance from the Insurance Fund and authorize disbursements therefrom. When the Governing Board is not in session, the Executive Committee thereof shall act as agent of the Governing Board, with full authority to act for it in passing upon such applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Executive Committee shall be composed of the chairman of the Governing Board and four additional members of the Governing Board chosen by it so that there shall be one member representing each of four geographic groupings of party states. The Governing Board shall make such geographic groupings. If there is representation of the United States on the Governing Board, one such representative may meet with the Executive Committee. The chairman of the Governing Board shall be chairman of the Executive Committee. No action of the Executive Committee shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which at least four members of such Committee are present and vote in favor thereof. Necessary expenses of each of the five members of the Executive Committee incurred in attending meetings of such Committee, when not held at the same time and place as a meeting of the Governing Board, shall be charges against the Insurance Fund.

       RTICLE VI. ASSISTANCE AND REIMBURSEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves:
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, or whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent, or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use monies made available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall give due notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the Insurance Fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to the compact administrator of each party state and to such other officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party states. The requesting state and any other party state shall be entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The Governing Board or the Executive Committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefor shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a determination of the Executive Committee shall upon notice in writing given within 20 days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the Governing Board. Determinations of the Executive Committee shall be reviewable only by the Governing Board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the Governing Board may authorize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this compact may receive monies from the Insurance Fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the Insurance Fund. The Governing Board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before authorizing the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the Insurance Fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation which may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of the federal government for such assistance and participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Insurance Fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent and degree of assistance or participation between and among the Insurance Fund, cooperating federal agencies, states and any other entities concerned.

       RTICLE VIII. RELATIONS WITH NONPARTY JURISDICTIONS.
      </p>
      <p>
       A party state may make application for assistance from the Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such application shall be considered and disposed of by the Governing Board or Executive Committee in the same manner as an application with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in this Article.
      </p>
      <p>
       At or in connection with any meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of this compact a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate, and receive information only to such extent as the Governing Board or Executive Committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be entitled to review of any determination made by the Executive Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state only after determining that the conditions in such state and the value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify them. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may set any conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to expenditures and activities outside of party states.

       RTICLE IX. FINANCE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Insurance Fund shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget for the Insurance Fund for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for presentation to the legislature thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The requests for appropriations shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth of the total budget in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products, produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops and products the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of products.
      </p>
      <p>
       The financial assets of the Insurance Fund shall be maintained in two accounts to be designated respectively as the "Operating Account" and the "Claims Account." The Operating Account shall consist only of those assets necessary for the administration of the Insurance Fund during the next ensuing two-year period. The Claims Account shall contain all monies not included in the Operating Account and shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be sufficient to pay all legitimate claims on the Insurance Fund for a period of three years. At any time when the Claims Account has reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the addition of monies requested for appropriation by the party states, the Governing Board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata basis in such manner as to keep the Claims Account within such maximum limit. Any monies in the Claims Account by virtue of conditional donations, grants or gifts shall be included in calculations made pursuant to this paragraph only to the extent that such monies are available to meet demands arising out of claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Insurance Fund shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Insurance Fund may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with monies available to it under Article IV (g) of this compact, provided that the Governing Board takes specific action setting aside such monies prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Insurance Fund makes use of monies available to it under Article IV (g) hereof, the Insurance Fund shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of monies by the party states adequate to meet the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Insurance Fund shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Insurance Fund shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Insurance Fund shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and a report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Insurance Fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       The accounts of the Insurance Fund shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly authorized officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the Insurance Fund.

      </p>
      <p>
       Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until two years after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An assessment shall be levied upon all cotton growers in this state to cover, in whole or in part, the cost of boll weevil suppression and eradication programs authorized by this article, subject to the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-156ol11">
       All assessments imposed on cotton shall be levied on a per acre or per bale basis as determined by the Commissioner upon recommendation of the cotton growers' organization; provided, however, that the per acre assessment shall continue to be used so long as acreage certification is available to the department;
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-156ol12">
       The per acre or per bale assessment, the period for which it shall be levied, and the geographical area to which the assessment applies shall be established by the Commissioner, upon recommendation by the board of directors of the cotton growers' organization;
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-156ol13">
       When the assessment is imposed on a per bale basis, it shall be the duty of each first handler of cotton from cotton growers in this state to collect the assessments imposed pursuant to this article on such cotton, to file reports on forms prescribed by the Commissioner listing such sales and the name of the grower, and to remit the amounts so imposed and collected to the Commissioner within 30 days of the date of purchase of the cotton;
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-156ol14">
       The Commissioner of Agriculture is authorized, and it shall be the Commissioner's duty, to receive, collect, hold in trust, and disburse all assessments and any other funds created under this article as trust funds of the cotton growers' organization, without complying with the requirements applicable to funds collected for the use and benefit of the state. Such funds shall not be required to be deposited in the state treasury and appropriated therefrom. All moneys collected by the Commissioner shall be deposited in a bank or other depository approved by the growers' organization and shall be disbursed by the Commissioner only upon the written authorization of the certified cotton growers' organization for the administration and implementation of the boll weevil eradication program. Should the eradication program be discontinued or certification of the growers' organization be revoked by the Commissioner, the assessments authorized by this article shall be discontinued on the date specified by the Commissioner and any funds remaining in its hands at such time are authorized to be paid out by the Commissioner for existing obligations and for winding up the affairs of the certified cotton growers' organization. Any funds remaining over and above those required for completing the business of the cotton growers' organization shall be paid by the Commissioner to the contributing growers on a pro rata basis;
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-156ol15">
       Records maintained by the Commissioner on behalf of the certified cotton growers' organization shall be audited at least annually by the state auditor;
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-156ol16">
       The Commissioner shall have a lien for the payment of assessments under this article which shall be of equal dignity with liens for taxes in favor of the state. The Commissioner is authorized to issue executions for the collection of such assessments in like manner as executions are issued for ad valorem property taxes due the state. It shall be the duty of each and every sheriff of this state and their lawful deputies, upon request of the Commissioner, to levy and collect such executions and to make their return thereof to the Commissioner in like manner as such tax executions are levied and return thereof made to county tax collectors and tax commissioners; provided, however, that the Commissioner shall be authorized to levy and collect his or her own executions;
      </li>
      <li id="t02c07s2-7-156ol17">
       In addition to the lien provided in paragraph (6) of this Code section, the Commissioner shall have a special lien on cotton for payment of assessments which shall be superior to any other lien provided by law, shall arise as of the time the assessments become due and payable, and shall cover all cotton grown by or ginned from the cotton grower from the date the lien arises until such assessments are paid; provided, however, that any buyers of cotton shall take free of such lien if such buyer has not received written notice of the lien from the Commissioner. Such lien extends to the proceeds of sale received by the person who originally bought the cotton from the grower. Notice may be provided by tagging the cotton as being subject to a delinquency or by documentation in the sales agreement indicating that the cotton is subject to a delinquency. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative is authorized and empowered to so tag the cotton wherever found. In order to enforce such liens, the Commissioner is authorized to issue an execution for the collection of delinquent assessments due the Commissioner. The execution shall be directed to all and singular sheriffs of this state and shall command them to levy upon the cotton of the cotton grower or notified initial buyer; provided, however, that the Commissioner shall be authorized to levy and collect his or her own executions. Each sheriff or the Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative shall execute the execution as in cases of writs of execution from the superior courts. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative may levy and conduct judicial sales in the manner provided by law for sales by sheriffs and constables. The special lien on cotton may also be enforced by a foreclosure action or action at law, as appropriate, brought by the Commissioner in the superior court of the county of residence of the person who originally bought the cotton from the grower. A buyer of cotton other than a person buying cotton from the grower takes free of the lien created by this paragraph.

      Any lender which has made or makes a loan to a farmer to finance the costs of production of an emerging crop on land in Georgia may make application to the Georgia Development Authority for an interest loan to pay interest on the loan during the period from the beginning of production to harvest or initial sale of the product, which payment shall be made from the fund. The maximum amount of interest loans from the fund for the benefit of any one farmer shall be $50,000.00; provided, however, that the Georgia Development Authority in administering the fund shall give priority to smaller interest loans. During the period that the Georgia Development Authority pays the interest on a loan from the fund, the maximum rate of interest which may be charged on the loan by the lender shall be as established from time to time by the Georgia Development Authority. By payment of the interest on a loan, neither the Georgia Development Authority nor the State of Georgia shall be a guarantor of the loan. The Georgia Development Authority shall, by rule or regulation, require such security or lien as may be necessary to provide adequate security for the authority as condition for making an interest loan as authorized by this chapter.

      Unless the Commissioner refuses the application on one or more of the grounds provided in Code Section 2-9-7, he or she shall issue to such applicant, upon the execution and delivery of a bond as provided in Code Section 2-9-5, a state license entitling the applicant to conduct business as a dealer in agricultural products.

     <p>
      Before any license is issued the applicant shall make and deliver to the Commissioner a surety bond executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the Commissioner. Any and all bond applications shall be accompanied by a certificate of "good standing" issued by the Commissioner of Insurance. If any company issuing a bond shall be removed from doing business in this state, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Insurance to notify the Commissioner of Agriculture within 30 days. The bond shall be in such amount as the Commissioner may determine, not exceeding an amount equal to the maximum amount of products purchased from or sold for Georgia producers or estimated to be purchased or sold in any month by the applicant; provided, however, that the minimum amount of such bond shall be $10,000.00 and the maximum amount of such bond shall be $230,000.00; provided, further, that in the case of pecans, such bond shall not exceed $500,000.00. Such bond shall be upon a form prescribed or approved by the Commissioner and shall be conditioned to secure the faithful accounting for and payment to producers or their agents or representatives of the proceeds of all agricultural products handled or sold by such dealer. However, in lieu of a surety bond, the Commissioner may accept a cash bond, which shall in all respects be subject to the same claims and actions as would exist against a surety bond. Whenever the Commissioner shall determine that a previously approved bond has for any cause become insufficient, the Commissioner may require an additional bond or bonds to be given, conforming with the requirements of this Code section. Unless the additional bond or bonds are given within the time fixed by written demand therefor, or if the bond of a dealer is canceled, the license of such person shall be immediately revoked by operation of law without notice or hearing and such person shall be ineligible to reapply for such license for a period of four years after such revocation.

      <p>
       Ga. L. 2019, p. 43,
   §
   2/HB 324, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: (a) The General Assembly finds that the establishment of the Low THC Oil Patient Registry in 2015 allows Georgia patients to possess low THC oil but provides no way to access low THC oil. The General Assembly finds that thousands of Georgians have serious medical conditions that can be improved by the medically approved use of cannabis and that the law should not stand between them and treatment necessary for life and health. The General Assembly finds that the purpose of this Act is to allow the legitimate use of medical cannabis for health care, including palliative care. The General Assembly finds that this Act does not in any way diminish this state's strong public policy and laws against illegal drug use, nor should it be deemed in any manner to advocate, authorize, promote, or legally or socially accept the use of marijuana for children or adults for any nonmedical use.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly further finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1)
   Low THC oil can offer significant medical benefits to patients;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2)
   Low THC oil can only be derived from the cannabis plant;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3)
   A carefully constructed system of in-state cultivation to benefit only those patients authorized by Georgia law and approved by their physician would benefit patients within the State of Georgia;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4)
   The State of Georgia is deeply opposed to any recreational or nonmedical use of marijuana, and any system to help patients access low THC oil should be as limited in scope as possible;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5)
   Business opportunities resulting from a system of in-state cultivation should be inclusive of minority, women, and veteran owned businesses;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6)
   Businesses resulting from this Act should include at least 20 percent participation by minority, women, and veteran owned businesses as licensees, suppliers, and partners of businesses licensed under this Act; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(7)
   The State of Georgia should encourage active participation by minority, women, and veteran owned businesses, as well as take any steps necessary to ensure there is no discrimination in the issuance of licenses or participation in business activities resulting from this Act."

      The General Assembly declares that for the purpose of fostering improved agricultural methods, promoting advances in agricultural fields, and giving legal status to an existing practice and for the general welfare of the people it is necessary to establish as a policy of this state a method for protecting the public in the guarantee of the high quality of seeds and plants for various agricultural pursuits. It is the intent of the General Assembly to carry out that policy by this article, protecting the public from false claims and unwarranted statements as to genetic identity, varietal purity, and germinating viability of seeds and plants presented and claimed to be foundation, registered, or certified.

       After completion of the informal hearing by the council, a report of findings and recommendations shall be transmitted to parties present at the arbitration process pursuant to subsection (e) of Code Section 2-11-73. In such report, the council may make any recommendations it deems fair and equitable under the circumstances presented. These recommendations are up to the discretion of the council and may include, but are not limited to, the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t02c11s2-11-76ol1a1">

         That money damages be paid to the purchaser as a result of the alleged failure of the seed to conform to or perform as represented by the seed label, container, or invoice;
         <p>
          (2.1) That money damages be paid to the purchaser of a commercial fruit or nut tree or trees as a result of the alleged failure of the tree or trees to be the variety represented to the purchaser. Such damages shall not be less than three times the purchase price in the case of fruit trees or six times the purchase price in the case of nut trees;

       In any litigation involving a complaint which has been the subject of arbitration under this Code section, any party may introduce the report of arbitration as evidence of the facts found in the report as the court may see fit. Findings and conclusions of the council are not admissible as evidence. However, the court may take into account any determinations of the council with respect to the failure of any party to cooperate in the arbitration proceedings.

       Withdrawal from distribution orders. When the Commissioner or his authorized agent has reasonable cause to believe that any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of this chapter or any of the prescribed regulations under this chapter, he may issue and enforce a written or printed withdrawal from distribution order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until written permission is given by the Commissioner or the court. The Commissioner shall release the lot of commercial feed so withdrawn when such provisions and regulations have been complied with.

   §

       - Trial court erred in declaring a new Vidalia onion packing regulation invalid because, pursuant to the Vidalia Onion Act, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t02c14s2-14-130" target="_self">2-14-130</a></cite> et seq., the packing date rule was within the Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture's authority and was not inconsistent with the shipping date statute as all authority to regulate packing and shipping rested with the Commissioner; and because some evidence was presented to support a finding that the packing date rule was reasonable in light of the testimony and letters received by the Commissioner concerning the declining quality of the Vidalia onion and the threat to the industry. Black v. Bland Farms, LLC, <cite class="ga_app_court">332 Ga. App. 653</cite>, <cite class="app_court">774 S.E.2d 722</cite> (2015), cert. denied, No. S15C1669, 2015 Ga. LEXIS 713 (Ga. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in concluding that the plaintiff had standing to bring the declaratory judgment action as the plaintiff made a sufficient showing that the facts were complete and that its interest was not merely academic, hypothetical, or colorable, but actual because, as a Vidalia onion grower, the plaintiff was an interested party claiming a right to ship onions pursuant to the shipping statute - a right the plaintiff claimed was impeded by a newly enacted regulation; and because, if the plaintiff failed to comply with the new regulation, the Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture had that statutory authority to impose civil and criminal penalties. Black v. Bland Farms, LLC, <cite class="ga_app_court">332 Ga. App. 653</cite>, <cite class="app_court">774 S.E.2d 722</cite> (2015), cert. denied, No. S15C1669, 2015 Ga. LEXIS 713 (Ga. 2015).

       <p>
        <p>
       While the shipping date statute provides that Vidalia onions may be shipped prior to the announced shipping date with a U.S. No. 1 grade certificate, the freedom to do so can be further limited by the authority of the Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture to regulate packing.

      The General Assembly recognizes that persons who patronize farms specializing in pick-your-own agricultural products may incur injuries as a result of the risks involved in such activity. The General Assembly also finds that the state and its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from such activity. The General Assembly finds, determines, and declares that this article is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly to encourage the direct sale of agricultural products from farmers to the general public by limiting the civil liability of farmers involved in such activity.
