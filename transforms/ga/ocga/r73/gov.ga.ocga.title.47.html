       Once every two years, the board of trustees or other governing authority of each local retirement system shall have the system's actuary make an actuarial investigation. Such actuarial investigation shall include the results of any actuarial investigation into the then current assumptions as to rates of interest, mortality, disability, withdrawal, and retirement. The actuarial investigation shall also include consideration of the experience of the retirement system under its assumptions and a comparison of results with the previous actuarial investigations and may also include such other studies as may be necessary or desirable for the completeness and accuracy of the actuarial investigation. The actuarial investigation shall also include a valuation of the contingent assets and liabilities of the retirement system and a determination of the payments necessary to amortize over a stated period any unfunded accrued liability disclosed. As an exhibit to the actuarial investigation, the local retirement system board of trustees or other governing authority thereof shall attach a copy of all the provisions of the plan for the local retirement system, including the requirements and conditions for qualifying to participate, the nature of benefits under the plan, and the manner in which the local retirement system is funded.

      Based on the most recent actuarial investigations on file pursuant to subsection (d) of Code Section 47-1-3 and financial reports submitted under subsections (e) through (j) of Code Section 47-1-3, the state auditor, once every two years beginning on January 1, 1997, shall submit a report on the condition of local retirement systems to the Governor and each member of the General Assembly. The report shall deal specifically with any local retirement system which the state auditor has reason to believe is not in actuarially sound condition or has not been in compliance with the provisions of Code Section 47-1-12. A copy of the state auditor's report shall also be sent to the Attorney General and to the applicable governing authority of the political subdivision and the applicable board of trustees or other governing authority of the local retirement system which the state auditor finds is not in actuarially sound condition or has not been in compliance with the provisions of Article 7 of Chapter 20 of this title.

     - General Assembly has the authority to enact a statute which proposes the forfeiture of earned retirement benefits of future public employees due to the conviction of a crime; however, an amendment to the Georgia Constitution proposing such a forfeiture by employees who are currently by law vested with rights under the public retirement system would, in all probability, be unconstitutional under the federal Impairment Clause contained in U.S. Const., Art.

The board of trustees shall calculate the amount of employee or member contribution which the returning veteran would have paid if he or she had been a member of the system or fund during the period of qualified service. If such contribution is based on the member's salary, the returning veteran's salary shall be deemed to be the rate the member would have received but for the period of qualified service or, if determination of such rate is not reasonably certain, the member's average rate of compensation during the 12 month period immediately preceding the period of qualified service or such lesser time as the member was employed.

      Retirement rights vested by one statute cannot be taken away

     by a subsequent statute. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-122.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once a right has been extended to the membership of a public retirement system by statute, it becomes part of the employment contract of the affected employees and cannot thereafter be constitutionally deleted or impaired. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U77-20.

      Forfeiture of benefits by employees convicted of crime.

    </h5>
    <p>
     - General Assembly has the authority to enact a statute which proposes the forfeiture of earned retirement benefits of future public employees due to the conviction of a crime; however, an amendment to the Georgia Constitution proposing such a forfeiture by employees who are currently by law vested with rights under the public retirement system would, in all probability, be unconstitutional under the federal Impairment Clause contained in U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 10. 1985 Op. Att'y Gen. No. U85-3.

      "Contingency clerks" not in retirement system.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     - Membership in the retirement system was envisioned for full-time employees of the State of Georgia who occupy positions potentially and probably requiring continued, nonintermittent employment of more than 35 (now 30) hours per week during at least nine months of a year; therefore, personnel within the Department of Labor who occupy the position of "contingency clerk" should not be considered as members of the system and should not be required to contribute to the retirement system, nor should employer contributions be made on their behalves. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-59.

     - To whatever extent the forfeiture and resignation provisions enacted in 1962 may be applicable to judges of the superior courts generally, it cannot be applied constitutionally to a judge to restrict or impair the retirement rights and benefits the judge received under the statute in effect when the judge took office; the judge is not required to resign the judge's emeritus eligibility prior to seeking a seat on the Supreme Court of Georgia. 1974 Op.

        <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1a1">
         "Employee" means an employee subject to the provisions of Code Section 47-2-2 who is discharged from employment pursuant to that Code section and who is aggrieved by such discharge from employment.
        </li>
        <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1a2">
         "Employer" shall have the same meaning as the definition of that word provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of Code Section 47-2-2.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1b">
       An employee shall have the right to judicial review of the employee's discharge from employment pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 47-2-2. Proceedings for judicial review may be instituted by filing a petition within 30 days after the date the employee's discharge from employment becomes final as specified in the notice sent to the employee pursuant to subsection (i) of Code Section 47-2-2. The petition may be filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county of residence of the employee. The petition shall state the nature of the employee's interest and the grounds as specified in subsection (f) of this Code section upon which the employee contends that the employee's discharge from employment should be reversed or modified. The petition may be amended by leave of the court. The filing of the petition does not itself stay the enforcement of the employer's decision to discharge the employee, but the reviewing court may order a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1c">
       Within 30 days after service of the petition or within further time allowed by the court, the employer shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record, which shall include the report prepared by the employer pursuant to subsection (j) of Code Section 47-2-2, of the proceedings under review. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1d">
       If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and there were good reasons for failure to present it in the hearing before the employer, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the employer upon conditions determined by the court. The employer may modify the employer's findings and decision to discharge the employee by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1e">
       The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the employer, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1f">
       The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the employer as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the employer or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision of the employer to discharge the employee if substantial rights of the employee have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decision of the employer were:
       <ol>
        <li id="t47c02s47-2-3ol1f1">
         In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;
        </li>

         Affected by other error of law;

         Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or

       It is determined by the General Assembly of Georgia that an adjustment in the compensation of state employees is necessary to assure the future actuarial soundness of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia and to preserve and protect the fiscal integrity of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia so as to ensure the future payment of retirement benefits and allowances to those entitled to same.

This additional 1 percent deducted from the earnable compensation of members shall be paid monthly to the board of trustees and shall be credited to the individual accounts of the members in the annuity savings fund.

       <p>
        - The 1980 amendment to this and related sections was enacted, in part, to provide state employees with increases in disposable income through the employer's payment of most of the employee contributions to the Employees' Retirement System. Rather than making this contribution personally, a state employee will, subsequent to July 1, 1980, take home most of the amount of the employee's previous employee contributions. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen.

      The pension accumulation fund shall be the fund in which shall be held the reserves for all annuities in force and from which shall be paid all annuities and all benefits in lieu of annuities under this chapter. If a beneficiary is restored to membership, his or her annuity reserve shall be transferred from the pension accumulation fund to his or her individual account in the annuity savings fund. The pension accumulation fund shall also be the fund in which are accumulated all reserves for the payment of all pensions and other benefits payable from contributions made by employers and from which are paid all such pensions and other benefits. Employer contributions shall consist of a percentage of the earnable compensation of members, to be known as the "normal cost contribution," and an additional percentage of such earnable compensation, to be known as the "unfunded accrued liability contribution." These contributions shall be borne by appropriations from state and federal funds. The percentage rate of each portion of the employer contribution shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system, as shown by actuarial valuation, as provided for in subsection (b) of Code Section 47-2-26, subject to the provisions of Code Section 47-20-10. All interest and dividends earned on the funds of the retirement system shall be credited to the pension accumulation fund. Once each year the board of trustees shall transfer from the pension accumulation fund to the annuity savings fund such amounts as are sufficient to allow regular interest on the balances of the individual accounts of members in the annuity savings fund.

       The retirement allowance of any member of Division A who retires under this chapter and accepts employment from any state department or any agency which is supported in whole or in part by state funds, regardless of the source of such funds, shall be suspended during such time of his or her employment. If he or she is employed in a department subject to this chapter, he or she shall again become a member of Division A but shall contribute only the required social security tax.

If the member's annuity savings account is insufficient to cover the required amount of employee tax, it shall be the duty of the fiscal officer of his or her employer to deduct from the current salary of the member such amounts as are necessary for payment of the employee tax. For those members of Division A covered for social security, it shall be the duty of the fiscal officers of the various employers to retain from each of the 5 1/2 percent employee-7 1/2 percent employer contributions for retirement system purposes, 2 percent of the member's first $4,200.00 annual wages, such amount to apply toward the employee-employer tax required under the Social Security Act. Any additional rate of employee-employer tax for social security shall result in a corresponding increase in the amount of tax payable by the employee and employer. All employee-employer taxes required under the Social Security Act after December 31, 1956, shall be retained by the fiscal officers of the various employers and reported to the board of trustees in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board of trustees. In order to facilitate the making of deductions and to simplify the reporting thereof for those members of Division A covered for social security, the board of trustees shall adopt such tables of employer and employee contributions as will result in uniform monthly contributions to the retirement system throughout the year. Such tables as adopted by the board of trustees shall not be placed in effect prior to January 1, 1963.

Such member shall become entitled to a service retirement allowance (1) upon filing an application as provided in Code Section 47-2-110 and (2) upon attaining the age of 60 or, at the member's option, at any time subsequent thereto after filing such application. The retirement allowance in the case of any such member shall be the monthly amount the member would have received had the member retired on the last day the member contributed to the retirement system and at that time had been the same age as when the member actually retired. If a member with vested rights dies before reaching age 60, the member's accumulated contributions shall be paid to the member's named living beneficiary, otherwise to the member's estate.

       - State employee is not involuntarily discharged from employment when the employee knowingly and intentionally brings about the discharge, or engages in conduct, such as insubordination, excessive absences, or other misconduct which the employee knew or should have known would lead to the employee's dismissal from employment. Haggins v. Employees' Retirement Sys., <cite class="ga_court">255 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">338 S.E.2d 1</cite> (1986).

       <p>
        <p>
       Employee's objectionable conduct, consisting of the illegal acceptance of gratuities and the purposeful failure to comply with state laws and regulations, constituted the kind of activity that any employee would know or should have known would result in the employee's dismissal, and thus did not constitute involuntary separation within the meaning of O.C.G.A.

       For purposes of this Code section, the terms "Justice Emeritus of the Supreme Court" and "Justice Emeritus" mean both Chief Justice Emeritus and Associate Justice Emeritus, and the term "Justice" means both Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The provisions of this or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, any person who becomes a Justice of the Supreme Court after April 1, 1964, shall be a member of the retirement system and shall not be eligible for appointment as Justice Emeritus of the Supreme Court. The prohibition against appointment as Justice Emeritus shall not apply to any person holding either the office of Justice of the Supreme Court or Judge of the Court of Appeals on April 1, 1964. Any person serving as Justice of the Supreme Court on that date must notify the director of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia on or before March 31, 1965, if he desires to become a member of the retirement system and shall otherwise be ineligible for membership. No Justice of the Supreme Court shall be allowed to rescind notification nor shall he be allowed to give notification after March 31, 1965. Any Justice of the Supreme Court who becomes a member of the retirement system shall, upon the effective date of his membership, begin making regular employee contributions under this chapter and shall be entitled to all the retirement allowances and credits under this chapter in the same manner as if he had become a member of the retirement system on January 1, 1950, which credits shall include credit for prior service and any services performed by him as an employee subsequent to that date. All employer contributions which would have been reported for the Justices of the Supreme Court between January 1, 1950, and April 1, 1964, shall be paid by the employer into the pension accumulation fund in such manner and over such period of time as shall be agreed upon between the board of trustees and the employer. Eligibility for survivors benefits under Code Section 47-2-128 for a present Justice of the Supreme Court shall be determined on the same basis as that applicable to all other members who were in state employment on or after January 1, 1953, and benefit amounts shall be based upon the age of the Justice on the effective date of his membership. Eligibility for survivors benefits for any person who enters on duty as a Justice after April 1, 1964, shall be determined in the same manner as for any other new member of the retirement system.

       - It is clear that, under the language of this statute, the General Assembly used permissive words and not mandatory provisions. A close analysis of the provisions reveals that the governing authority of the county in which the court is located can deduct or collect employee contributions only from members, and there is no authorization contained therein that contributions shall apply in a mandatory manner to all officers and employees of the courts. This restrictive language, considered with the permissive words "authorized to become members," clearly shows this statute to be permissive and not mandatory. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 225 (see O.C.G.A.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t47c02s47-2-292" target="_self">47-2-292</a></cite> mandated that employees of the Madison County Tax Commissioner's Office (TCO) be subject to a merit system under which the employees were entitled to a hearing prior to termination. However, the statute contained no such requirement, and plaintiff did not point to any evidence that the TCO of Madison County promulgated a merit system that required a hearing prior to termination for cause; accordingly, plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing prior to termination and did not have a protected property interest in continued employment with the TCO.

       Any person who becomes a member after January 1, 1980, but before July 1, 1981, as a result of employment with a juvenile detention facility which has been acquired from a county by a state department and who was an employee of such county immediately prior to becoming a member of this retirement system in a position covered under its retirement or pension system shall have the option of transferring to the retirement system the employer and employee contributions credited to him for service as an employee of the juvenile detention facility. This option must be exercised within six months after becoming a member of the retirement system. It shall be exercised by notifying, in writing, the governing body of the county retirement or pension system and the board of trustees of the member's desire that such contributions be transferred.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c02s47-2-295ol1b">
       Within 30 days after receiving such notification, the governing body of the county retirement or pension system shall pay to the board of trustees of this retirement system an amount equal to such employer and employee contributions. Upon the receipt of such payment, the board of trustees shall deposit that portion representing employee contributions into the annuity savings fund as a credit to the member; and it shall deposit that portion representing employer contributions into the pension accumulation fund. Upon deposit of such contributions, the member shall receive credit for past service rendered as an employee of the county juvenile detention facility; but the amount of past service credited to such member shall be adjusted as necessary so that the accrued liability to this retirement system created by such past service shall be fully funded by the amount of the payment received by the board of trustees from the county retirement or pension system.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c02s47-2-295ol1c">
       If the payment received by the board of trustees is insufficient to cover all past service rendered as an employee of the county juvenile detention facility on a year-for-year basis, the governing authority of the county which formerly employed such member shall be authorized, but not required, to pay to the board of trustees an amount which, when combined with the payment of employer and employee contributions, shall be sufficient to fund all service rendered as an employee of the juvenile detention facility. In the event a county governing authority elects to pay such additional amount, it shall request, in writing, a certification from the board of trustees of such amount; and, upon such payment, the member shall be given credit for all service rendered as an employee of the county juvenile detention facility. The amount, if any, paid by a county governing authority shall be deposited by the board of trustees into the pension accumulation fund.

Employer contributions for continued membership in the local retirement system shall be computed at the same percentage rate applicable to all other state employees on the basis of the state salary paid to such employees electing to continue membership in the local retirement system and shall be paid by the Department of Corrections or by another state department when applicable to the local retirement system; provided, however, that, if the employer contributions paid by the Department of Corrections or other state department exceed the employer contributions applicable to all other employees of the local retirement system, the difference between the percentage rate of employer contributions paid by the Department of Corrections or other state department and the percentage rate of employer contributions applicable to all other employees of the local retirement system shall be applied to offset the percentage rate of employee contributions required of such state employees remaining in the local retirement system; provided, further, that, if the employer contributions to be paid by the Department of Corrections or other state department under this subsection would exceed the total employee and employer contributions required under the local retirement system, the Department of Corrections or other state department shall only be required to pay the total amount of such employee and employer contributions required under the local retirement system. An employee continuing membership under a local retirement system under this subsection shall retain all rights, benefits, and privileges under the local retirement system in the same manner and to the same extent as if the employee remained an employee of the county. An employee electing to continue membership in a local retirement system shall not be and may not become a member of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia.

       An employee who was a member of a local retirement system as provided in subsection (c) of this Code section may elect to become a member of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia, except as otherwise provided by subsection (f) of this Code section.

For each employee so electing, the governing authority of the applicable county or the board of trustees or other managing body of the applicable local retirement system, within 30 days after receiving the notice provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section, shall pay to the Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia a portion of the total employee contributions plus interest made by the employee to the local retirement system. This payment shall be equal to the employee contribution plus interest which would have been accumulated had the employee always been covered by the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia. Any additional amount, as determined by the Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia, shall be paid by the local retirement system to a maximum of prior county contributions plus interest. Any further additional sum required will be paid by the local governing authority. These two sums together with the contributions of transferring employees plus interest shall be sufficient to grant the creditable service under the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia authorized by this subsection without creating any accrued liability, as a result of granting such creditable service, against the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia. The employee contributions paid to the board of trustees under this subsection shall be deposited by the board into the annuity savings fund as a credit to the member. Other funds paid to the board of trustees under this subsection shall be deposited by the board into the pension accumulation fund. Upon receiving the payments provided for by this subsection, the board of trustees shall enter the creditable service provided for by this subsection upon the records of the member. The employee contributions in an amount exceeding those necessary to cover the period of creditable service as a state employee under the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia shall be refunded to the employee upon application to the board of trustees of the local retirement system.

        The Georgia Federal-State Shipping Point Inspection Service, hereinafter referred to as the "inspection service" in this Code section, is declared to be an adjunct of the Georgia Department of Agriculture, such inspection service assisting in the agricultural products inspection duties of that department. All employees of the inspection service shall be subject to a merit system of personnel administration established by the agencies which are parties to a cooperative agreement between the Consumer and Marketing Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Georgia Department of Agriculture. All employees shall perform services on the basis of merit, fitness, and efficiency. The establishment of this merit system prior to July 1, 1975, shall be a prerequisite to coverage of the inspection service under the retirement system.

       <li id="t47c02s47-2-310ol1b">
        Any person employed by the inspection service on July 1, 1975, is authorized to become a member of Division A of the retirement system. Any person first employed or reemployed by the inspection service after July 1, 1975, shall, as a condition of employment, become a member of Division A of the retirement system. In order to become or be required to be a member of the retirement system, an employee of the inspection service must be employed in this state in a position normally requiring actual performance of duty during not less than nine months of the year.
       </li>
       <li id="t47c02s47-2-310ol1c">
        The Georgia Department of Agriculture shall be responsible for making certain that the administrative officials of the inspection service shall deduct or collect from each member the employee contributions required by the retirement system and remit them to the retirement system as required by law or regulations. The Commissioner of Agriculture is authorized and directed to pay from the funds appropriated for the operation of the Georgia Department of Agriculture the employer contributions required by the retirement system or by regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Such employer contributions shall be paid by the Commissioner upon receipt of an invoice from the retirement system.

        Any person who becomes a member of the retirement system under this Code section, upon certified proof of previous service with the inspection service, shall be eligible to receive up to five years of credit for such previous service by paying the regular employer and employee contributions, including accrued interest, that would have accumulated during such period of employment. In the computation of such contributions and interest, the compensation of such member shall be deemed to have been the same as the compensation such member received on the date he first became a member. For any member claiming creditable service under this subsection on and after July 1, 1983, the board of trustees shall calculate the period of time the contributions and interest provided for above will fund as creditable service under the retirement system without creating any additional accrued liability of the retirement system; and the amount of creditable service so determined shall be the creditable service to which the member is entitled. The inspection service shall be authorized to supplement contributions and interest provided for above in an amount, as determined by the board of trustees, which, together with such contributions and interest, will fully fund as creditable service the total amount of previous service claimed without creating any additional accrued liability of the retirement system, and in the event such supplement is paid by the inspection service to the board of trustees, the member shall be entitled to receive all such previous service as creditable service up to the maximum of five years. Credit for previous service shall be available to a member only after he has worked for the inspection service for one full year following July 1, 1975, and must be exercised, if at all, within one year after the time any such member becomes eligible to elect such option or by not later than January 1, 1984, whichever date is later.

     </b>
     Like a private employer with the power to contract, a local school system may condition employment upon certain requirements so long as the requirements do not violate the Constitution or laws of this state. The teacher's contract may not be unilaterally modified in mid-term to include such a condition; therefore, unless a teacher otherwise agrees to participate in a tax sheltered annuity, the requirement of participation must be included in the employment contract prior to execution and must be agreed upon by both parties before such condition is enforceable. 1981 Op.

      Make greater increase in salary than required to pay superintendent's contribution.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - For a local school board to pay a local school superintendent's contributions to the Teachers Retirement System, for health insurance, and social security, it must increase the superintendent's salary since O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t47c03s47-3-41" target="_self">47-3-41</a></cite> provides that such contributions must be deducted from the superintendent's salary. However, the increase of the salary would itself be subject to the required deduction since it would increase the amount of earnable compensation; thus, the amount of increase required to pay the contribution would obviously have to be more than the amount of the contribution itself. Likewise, for a local school board to make such contributions under the Teachers Health Insurance Plan, it must increase the superintendent's salary since the law provides that such contributions must be withheld from the superintendent's salary. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-55.

        <p>
       - Statute defines an "employer" of a teacher as that agency "by which a teacher is paid"; therefore, when a teacher is paid by the Department of Education, that department should make the contribution to the retirement system; when a teacher is paid by a local board of education, the local board should make the contribution. 1948-49 Op.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - For a local school board to pay a local school superintendent's contributions to the Teachers Retirement System for health insurance and social security, the board must increase the superintendent's salary since O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t47c03s47-3-41" target="_self">47-3-41</a></cite> provides that such contributions must be deducted from the superintendent's salary. However, the increase of the salary would itself be subject to the required deduction since it would increase the amount of earnable compensation; thus, the amount of increase required to pay the contribution would obviously have to be more than the amount of the contribution itself. Likewise, for a local school board to make such contributions under the Teachers Health Insurance Plan, the board must increase the superintendent's salary since the law provides that such contributions must be withheld from the superintendent's salary. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-55 (see O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        - If a teacher has 13 years of accrued creditable service under the retirement system acquired before July 1, 1943 (now January 1, 1945), immediately prior to joining a local system, and that teacher applies ten of those years toward a local retirement fund, that retired teacher would have to serve five years of membership service under the retirement system at some time to be eligible for the normal retirement benefits payable on the three years not applied to the local system; also, if this teacher acquires the necessary five years of membership service in order to qualify for the creditation of prior service as a "regular member" of the retirement system, the teacher would be entitled to a benefit based on what would have been the annuity contributions during the ten transferred years had that teacher actually been paying contributions during that period; this teacher, however, would not be entitled to the pension amounts on these ten years applied to the local fund because those amounts must be paid to the local fund. 1950-51 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-113.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a teacher includes previous service in a system under the retirement system toward retirement under a local retirement fund, and the retirement system pays the pension amounts on that service to the local fund, the teacher cannot be allowed pension benefits from the retirement system based on those same years for which payments are being made to the local fund, as this would clearly amount to a double payment. 1974 Op.

        - Term
   "classroom teacher" is used within the definition of "teacher" in the Teachers Retirement Act. It is a recognized term already employed by the Act. If the General Assembly meant to limit the application of Ga. Laws 1974, pp. 1139-41, to classroom or "blackboard" teachers, surely the term "classroom teachers" would have been utilized. Furthermore, it would seem manifestly difficult to articulate the scope and definition of the term "public schoolteachers." If the General Assembly intended to limit the application of the 1974 amendment to a sub-class of "teachers," then more of a definition than "public schoolteachers" would have been provided. 1975 Op.

      "Employer" of teacher makes contribution to retirement system.

   1 (see O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t47c03s47-3-1" target="_self">47-3-1</a></cite>) defines an "employer" of a teacher as that agency "by which a teacher is paid"; therefore, when a teacher is paid by the Department of Education, that department should make the contribution to the retirement system; when a teacher is paid by a local board of education, the local board should make the contribution. 1948-49 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 149.

      Pension from retirement system not based on local retirement fund.

    </h5>
    <p>
     - If a teacher includes previous service in a system under the retirement system toward retirement under a local retirement fund, and the retirement system pays the pension amounts on that service to the local fund, the teacher cannot be allowed pension benefits from the retirement system based on those same years for which payments are being made to the local fund as this would clearly amount to a double payment. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 74-21.

         Make greater increase in salary than required to pay superintendent's contribution.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - For a local school board to pay a local school superintendent's contributions to the Teachers Retirement System, for health insurance, and social security, the board must increase the superintendent's salary since O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t47c03s47-3-41" target="_self">47-3-41</a></cite> provides that such contributions must be deducted from the superintendent's salary. However, the increase of the salary would itself be subject to the required deduction since it would increase the amount of earnable compensation; thus, the amount of increase required to pay the contribution would obviously have to be more than the amount of the contribution itself. Likewise, for a local school board to make such contributions under the Teachers Health Insurance Plan, the board must increase the superintendent's salary since the law provides that such contributions must be withheld from the superintendent's salary. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-55.

A member who has not withdrawn the member's contributions to the retirement system may be reinstated to membership without paying the reinstatement fees after the member renders at least one year of membership service subsequent to the break in service. All interest credits shall cease after any such break in service but shall begin again on the date of payment of the sum required for reinstatement to membership or on the first day of July immediately following the completion of one year of membership service following the break in service. The board of trustees may approve the continued membership of a member while in the armed forces of the United States or other emergency wartime service of the United States, or a member whose membership would be terminated because of illness which prevents the member from rendering the service otherwise required by this Code section. The board of trustees may also grant an additional year of leave to a teacher for each child born to or adopted by such teacher while on authorized leave.

Such teachers shall make no contributions to this retirement system and shall be eligible for pension benefits under this retirement system only under this Code section. If such a teacher retires under his or her local retirement fund and if at the time of his or her retirement he or she would have been eligible for service retirement under this retirement system had he or she been a member, the board of trustees shall pay from this retirement system to the managing board of the local retirement fund a pension equal to the pension for membership service which would have been payable under this retirement system in respect to the part of his or her earnable compensation payable from state funds if such member had been classified as a member of this retirement system immediately prior to the time of his or her retirement; provided, however, upon service retirement of any teacher who is a member of a local retirement fund, the local retirement fund under which such teacher retired shall receive a service retirement pension on account of his or her service thereunder, in accordance with the provisions of this Code section, which shall consist of:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t47c03s47-3-65ol11">
       A pension equal to the annuity which would have been allowable at age of retirement if such teacher had been a member of this retirement system and had made contributions of 5 percent of his or her earnable compensation payable from state funds, but not to exceed an annuity allowable at age 65, computed on the basis of such contributions as would have been made prior to age 65; and

        It shall be the duty of the employers operating local retirement funds to report to the board of trustees annually or at such other intervals as shall be set by the board of trustees the earnable compensation paid from state funds of each teacher in their employ who is paid from state funds and such other information as may be needed for establishing the prospective benefit of the member.

      Any provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any teacher shall be entitled to have all teaching service included in computing creditable service, notwithstanding breaks in membership of more than four years, provided that such teacher pays into the retirement system an amount equal to the minimum required for continuous members, plus regular interest that would have accrued on such contributions during periods of nonmembership. No member shall receive credit for teaching service if contributions were not made during the teaching service or have not later been contributed with interest that would have accrued on such contributions, provided that after three years' membership service a member may reestablish previous credits by paying into the retirement system, prior to retirement, contributions equal to 10 percent of such compensation as he received during those years and for which he desires to establish previous credit, plus regular interest that would have accrued on such contributions.

This reduction shall not apply in calculating the service allowance for disability retirement or death.Any member who retired with 30 or more years of creditable service and whose retirement benefits were reduced because such member retired at an age below the normal retirement age in effect at the time such member retired shall be entitled to an adjusted retirement benefit based upon a calculation made without the application of the age reduction factor.

The basis for such increase shall be the average percentage of increase in retirement benefits which results from the change in the retirement benefit formula. This subsection shall apply to all changes in the retirement benefit formula which have become effective since June 30, 1975, and those which may become effective at any time after June 30, 1977, for all beneficiaries under this chapter who retired on or before June 30, 1977. Any member who retires at any time after June 30, 1977, shall receive the benefit adjustment provided for in this subsection only for those changes in the retirement benefit formula which become effective after his retirement.

      (e.1)Option five shall consist of a reduced retirement allowance together with a partial lump sum distribution. This option may be elected by any retiring member including members electing another optional allowance under this Code section except that this option shall not be available to members retiring pursuant to Code Section 47-3-122 or members subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of Code Section 47-3-120. The amount of the lump sum distribution under this subsection may not exceed the sum of 36 months of the monthly retirement allowance the retiring member would have received had he or she not elected the partial lump sum option. The partial lump sum distribution will be made as a single payment payable at the time the first monthly retirement allowance is paid to the retired member.

The medical board shall approve the application if, after a medical examination of such member by a qualified physician appointed by the board of trustees, it finds that the applicant is mentally or physically incapacitated for further performance of duty involving active membership with the retirement system, that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the applicant should be retired. The effective date of retirement will be the first of the month in which the application is received by the board of trustees, provided that no retirement application will be effective earlier than the first of the month following the final month of the applicant's employment.

The board of trustees may make further changes in his disability benefit in response to further change in his earning capacity, provided that the new pension shall not cause the total of his disability retirement benefit together with the amount earnable by him to exceed the current rate of compensation, as determined by the board of trustees, for the position which he held at the time of his disability retirement.

       <p>
        - Term
   "classroom teacher" is used within the definition of "teacher" in the Teachers Retirement Act. It is a recognized term already employed by the Act. If the General Assembly meant to limit the application of Ga. Laws 1974, pp. 1139-41, to classroom or "blackboard" teachers, surely the term "classroom teachers" would have been utilized. Furthermore, it would seem manifestly difficult to articulate the scope and definition of the term "public schoolteachers." If the General Assembly intended to limit the application of the 1974 amendment to a sub-class of "teachers," then more of a definition than "public schoolteachers" would have been provided. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-9.

       It is declared to be the intent of the General Assembly to provide a method whereby the municipal corporations and certain other entities of this state may, in the discretion of their respective governing bodies, provide retirement and other benefits to their employees through a common administrative and investment system. Such a system based on joint participation will permit municipal corporations and other entities, regardless of size, to provide certain benefits to their employees, will reduce overall administrative costs which might be prohibitive if undertaken individually, will make possible better investment opportunities, and through a provision for continuity of service will provide added security for professional employees who transfer from one municipal corporation or other entity to another in the state. Creation of such a retirement system is considered to be in the public interest in order to attract and retain better qualified personnel in local governmental service and to provide greater personal security to local governmental employees in their old age.

         The board of trustees has the power to establish one or more master plans which may be adopted by any employer. The employees to be covered, the retirement and employee benefits to be provided, and the terms and conditions for retirement benefits and other benefits shall be provided in the master plan. A municipal corporation is empowered to adopt such a plan by ordinance or resolution and to execute an agreement with the board of trustees to provide retirement and employee benefits as provided in the plan. Other employers shall have the power to adopt such plans by resolution of its governing body and to execute such agreements. The agreement, plan, and trust entered into by each member employer shall constitute a separate plan and trust and should be considered as such by the board of trustees. A master plan providing employee benefits may provide for the method of funding such benefits through the use of insurance, self-funding, or otherwise.

     </p>
     <ol>

        <p>
       - Even though the position of senior judge is not an elected one, Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. III allows a senior judge to exercise judicial power in the superior courts when the assistance of a senior judge is necessary. O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There is no merit to the argument that the authorization for the service of senior judges conflicts with Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. I, vesting judicial power in designated courts, because creation of the position of senior judge does not establish a separate judicial forum. Smith v.

       - An order of the Governor that a judge emeritus (now senior judge) hear and determine "any and all other cases which may be pending" and "any and all other cases which may properly come before said court for disposition" is manifestly unauthorized by law, and hence confers no authority upon the judge to hear and determine such cases.

       - Because a superior court judge emeritus (now senior judge) had not been granted constitutional or statutory authority to serve as a superior court judge, except when the Governor was authorized to call upon the judge to do so, or the judge was selected to serve as such in a civil case under the provisions of former Code 1933,

       - Superior court judge is entitled to disability benefits although the judge has not attained the required retirement age, provided the judge otherwise meets the requirements of Ga. L. 1945, p. 362 (see O.C.G.A. Ch. 8, T. 47); if such a judge makes the election provided by these provisions, fully complies with the statutory terms, and dies after being entitled to disability benefits, the judge's widow thereby would be entitled to the benefits provided, instead of being forced to accept a return of contributions in accordance with this statute. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-331 (see O.C.G.A.

      The state shall pay benefits under this chapter to all superior court judges who are eligible for retirement under this chapter without regard to the sufficiency of the fund to pay such benefits. Prior to any withdrawal against general funds of the state for payment of benefits, all interest and moneys earned and accumulated by investment pursuant to Code Section 47-8-4 shall be disbursed as benefits. The employee contributions paid by the employer to the fund on behalf of a judge of the superior courts, as provided in subsection (a) of Code Section 47-8-44, after July 1, 1980, shall be considered to be payments made by the judge.

      Retirement eligibility, regardless of age.

    </h5>
    <p>
     - If a district attorney has served 19 years in that capacity, the district attorney is eligible to retire as a district attorney emeritus regardless of the district attorney's age. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-17.
    </p>

     <b>
      Service as an assistant district attorney may be credited
     </b>
     towards eligibility for appointment as district attorney emeritus as long as the assistant district attorney was performing the duties of a district attorney in the prosecution of cases in both the superior and city court, and such service as an assistant was immediately prior to appointment or election as district attorney; further, that, prior to appointment as a district attorney emeritus, the majority of time must have been as a district attorney. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-25.

    <p>
     <b>
      Service as a member of the General Assembly,
     </b>
     not to exceed three years, is creditable towards appointment under the district attorney emeritus program, provided payment into the retirement fund is properly made. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-25.

     <b>
      Service as city court solicitor

     is creditable, but the district attorney must make payments into the fund to cover the entire period for which retirement is to be paid; while the statute sets a time limit upon when payments for military service are to be made, it is silent as to the time when service as a city court solicitor must be paid for; consequently, the district attorney may make these payments at the conclusion of the district attorney's first term of office. 1972 Op.

     <p>
      In addition to listing and claiming credit for prior services as a sheriff under paragraph (4) of Code Section 47-16-40, the applicant may elect to list and claim credit for service in the armed forces of the United States, not to exceed four years, and service as a peace officer other than as a sheriff, not to exceed four years, provided that he was employed during such period as a peace officer by the state, a municipality, or any other political subdivision of this state and was required by the terms of such employment, whether by election or appointment, to devote his full time to the duties of a peace officer. Upon approval or acceptance of such claims by the board, the applicant shall be credited with such service as a basis for future contemplated retirement, provided that credit for such service shall be available only if the applicant shall have served as a sheriff for a minimum of eight years subsequent to December 31, 1960, and subsequent to periods of service for which credit under this Code section is claimed; provided, further, that amounts due under paragraph (5) of Code Section 47-16-40 have been paid for such periods.

       At the time a member becomes eligible for retirement benefits, he or she shall choose one of three payment options for retirement benefits. The member must indicate his or her choice of payment options upon the application for retirement benefits filed with the secretary-treasurer. Upon approval of the member's application by the board, such member shall be paid retirement benefits in the form of a monthly sum of money determined in accordance with the option he or she has selected. The three payment options are as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t47c16s47-16-101ol1a1">
         Option One shall be known as a "single life annuity" and shall provide retirement benefits for the life of the member only. If the member has no more than four years of service credited to such member under this chapter, the member shall be paid a benefit of $380.00 per month until the member's death. If the member has more than four years credited to such member under the provisions of this chapter, such member shall be paid a benefit of $380.00 per month, plus $95.00 per month for each additional year of service so credited to the member. If the member has additional service credit not totaling a full year, the further sum of one-twelfth of the amount paid per month for each additional year of service credit over four years shall be paid for each month of additional service so credited to the member; provided, however, that in no case shall such benefits exceed $2,850.00 per month; provided, further, that the board of commissioners shall be authorized to increase such benefits by an amount not to exceed 3 percent per annum based on the following factors:

         Option Two shall be known as a "100 percent joint life annuity" and shall provide retirement benefits for the life of either the member or his or her spouse, whichever is the survivor. The monthly amount to be paid under this option shall be based on the member's age and that of his or her spouse at the member's retirement and shall be the actuarial equivalent of the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Actuarial equivalents shall be computed using a current and accurate mortality table adopted by the board; and

         Option Three shall be known as the "50 percent contingency life annuity" and shall provide for payment of a 50 percent benefit for the life of the surviving spouse. The amount to be paid under this option shall be based on the member's age and that of his or her spouse at the member's retirement and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly benefit which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Actuarial equivalents shall be computed using a current and accurate mortality table adopted by the board. When a retired member has elected Option Two or Option Three, in the event the spouse predeceases the retired member, the monthly retirement benefit payable to the retired member after the death of the spouse shall be increased to the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. In the event any such retired member remarries or has remarried after the death of the former spouse, the retired member may elect to begin receiving the applicable reduced retirement benefit of equivalent actuarial value and reestablish on behalf of the new spouse the same option which was applicable to the deceased former spouse, but such option on behalf of the new spouse may not be reestablished until one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA51, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions.

        <li id="t47c16s47-16-101ol1b2">
         At any time after the entry of a final judgment of divorce, a retired member receiving benefits under either Option Two or Option Three may continue receiving benefits under the option so chosen for the benefit of the former spouse or may revoke the election. In the event the retired member revokes the election, the retired member shall begin receiving the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. Benefits paid under Option One to a retired member following such revocation shall not be retroactive. In the event that the retired member remarries after divorce from the former spouse and the member elected to revoke Option Two or Option Three as provided in this paragraph, the retired member may elect to begin receiving reduced monthly retirement benefits of actuarial equivalence under either Option Two or Option Three. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA5 1, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions.

    - Investigators at issue who are employed by the Georgia Forestry Commission and by the Georgia Department of Agriculture do not meet the definition of peace officer in O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t47c17s47-17-1ol15A" target="_self">47-17-1(5)(A)</a></cite> as that definition has been interpreted by the Georgia Supreme Court and that the investigators therefore are not eligible for membership in the Peace Officers Annuity Board Fund. Although it is clear that these investigators perform important functions for the citizens of this state, the investigators' specific missions do not meet the criteria established by the General Assembly, as interpreted by the Georgia Supreme Court, for membership in this supplemental retirement fund. This conclusion, of course, in no way limits their status as members of the Employees Retirement System of Georgia, the primary pension fund for state employees.

       <p>

       In determining whether a person is a "peace officer"
      
      as contemplated by this statute, the court has stressed the duties which the law imposes upon the person. Fleming v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 737</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 276</cite> (1969) (see O.C.G.A.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In determining the question of whether or not a party is a peace officer authorizing the party's membership in the fund, the party's authority to act as a peace officer "must be found in some public law." Fleming v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 737</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 276</cite> (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Party's classification by the personnel board as a civilian employee, the party's membership in the city's general pension fund, and the fact that the party does not wear a uniform or receive a uniform allowance are immaterial in determining whether the party is a "peace officer" within the statutory definition. Fleming v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 737</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 276</cite> (1969).

        "Public order"
       
       means the tranquility and security which every person feels under the protection of the law, a breach of which is an invasion of the protection which the law affords. Board of Comm'rs v.

        To preserve the public peace

A pro rata portion of one-half of such amount, determined by the number of months of creditable service requested by each person, shall be assigned as such person's employee contribution required to receive such creditable service. The board shall notify each applicant of his or her pro rata share, and each such person shall pay such amount to the board not later than March 1, 2007, or thereafter be ineligible to receive such creditable service. During the regular 2007 session, the General Assembly may appropriate funds sufficient to cover one-half of the amount determined by the actuary as necessary to grant the creditable service, together with any portion of the total required employee contribution which was not received by the board from the applicants by March 1, 2007.

       At the time a member qualifies for retirement payments, such member must choose a payment option provided for in this Code section. A member shall become eligible to begin receiving benefits on the first day of the month following the month in which the member qualified for retirement and terminated active employment as a peace officer. A member shall present to the secretary-treasurer a completed application form for retirement benefits. The application shall contain such information as the board shall require. After approval by the board, the secretary-treasurer shall pay to such retired member a monthly sum based on the option chosen by the member. If a married member with a spouse then living is unable to choose an option provided for in this Code section and to complete an application form because of death, mental incompetency, or other providential cause, then Option Two shall become effective.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c17s47-17-80ol1b">
       Option One shall consist of a single life annuity payable in monthly payments for the life of the member only. The monthly payment under this option shall be an amount equal to $17.50 per month for each full year of creditable service and in the event the member shall have additional service credit not totaling a full year, the further sum of one-twelfth of the amount paid per month for each additional year of service credit shall be paid for each month of additional service credit, provided that the member either has at least ten years of membership service, or 15 years for members who become members on or after July 1, 2010, and is at least 55 years of age or has at least 30 years of creditable service, regardless of age. Such monthly benefit payment shall be paid on each full year and additional full months of creditable service up to a maximum of 30 years of total service. No member shall be eligible for benefits under this option until the member's official duties as a peace officer have been terminated, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and unless the member files an application for retirement benefits within 90 days from the date of the termination of the member's official duties as a peace officer, unless prevented therefrom for good cause. If such member shall qualify for retirement benefits in every respect except for completion of payment of monthly dues for the periods of time for which the member has received service credit, dues shall be deducted from the member's monthly benefit check until such dues have been paid in full. Any member who has at least ten years of membership service, or 15 years for members who become members on or after July 1, 2010, for which dues have been fully paid but who has not reached 55 years of age may cease paying monthly dues into the fund if the member's employment as a peace officer is terminated; and upon reaching 55 years of age the member may be eligible to receive retirement benefits under this option.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c17s47-17-80ol1c">
       Option Two shall consist of a 100 percent joint life annuity payable during the life of the member or the member's spouse. The amount of monthly payment to be paid under this option shall be based on the date the member first becomes eligible to receive pension benefits (normal retirement date) and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Such actuarial equivalence shall be computed on the interest rate and mortality basis approved from time to time by the board, the age of the member, and, if applicable, the age of his or her spouse as of the date benefits are to commence or as of the date benefits would have commenced if the member had retired after first becoming eligible for full benefits, whichever is earlier.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c17s47-17-80ol1d">
       Option Three shall consist of a contingency life annuity with a 50 percent monthly payment to the surviving spouse. The amount of monthly payment to be paid under this option shall be based on the date the member first becomes eligible to receive pension benefits (normal retirement date) and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Such actuarial equivalence shall be computed on the interest rate and mortality basis approved from time to time by the board, the age of the member, and, if applicable, the age of his or her spouse as of the date benefits are to commence or as of the date benefits would have commenced if the member had retired after first becoming eligible for full benefits, whichever is earlier.

        <li id="t47c17s47-17-80ol1e2">
         Under Option Two or Three, a retired member may revoke the election of any such option at any time after the entry of a final judgment of complete divorce from the retired member's spouse or the retired member may elect to continue under Option Two or Three for the benefit of the former spouse. Upon any such revocation, the retired member shall begin receiving the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. In the event any such retired member remarries after divorce from the former spouse and the retired member elected to revoke Option Two or Three as provided in this paragraph, the retired member may elect to begin receiving the applicable reduced monthly retirement benefit of equivalent actuarial value and reestablish on behalf of the new spouse the same option which was applicable to the former spouse. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA51, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions. The option on behalf of the new spouse may not be exercised until one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier.

Any peace officer becoming a member of the fund between April 1, 1953, and March 31, 1965, inclusive, must remain an active member and, in addition to completing the required years of service, must remit the correct amount of dues to the fund for a period of three years from the date he or she becomes a member, irrespective of previous service credited for which dues are paid, before being eligible for any retirement benefits provided under this Code section. Any peace officer becoming a member of the fund for the first time on or after April 1, 1965, must remain an active member and, in addition to completing the required years of service, must remit the correct amount of dues to the fund for a period of five years from the date he or she becomes a member, irrespective of previous service credited for which dues are paid, before being eligible for any retirement benefits provided under this Code section.

During such period of reemployment, said member shall pay regular monthly dues into this fund. Upon meeting the requirements provided by law, such member shall be entitled to all benefits provided for in Code Sections 47-17-81 and 47-17-82; but such member shall not be entitled to any increase in retirement benefits by virtue of service during the period of reemployment unless such reemployment is for a term of three years or more, in which instance such member may again apply for retirement as if he or she had not previously been retired; and he or she shall be entitled to such benefits as may be provided by law at that time, if he or she so chooses.

       A member may make a one-time election to convert the retirement allowance otherwise payable to him or her into a modified retirement allowance of equivalent actuarial value and designate a natural person to receive a survivors benefit in accordance with one of the options set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection. Such retirement allowance shall be actuarially reduced in accordance to the designated survivor's projected life span. Such actuarial adjustment shall be computed upon the basis of the mortality tables and rates of interest last adopted by the board of trustees. Such election may be made only after the member has become eligible to retire and before the first payment of his or her retirement allowance normally becomes due. Such election shall be irrevocable except as otherwise provided in this Code section.

        <li id="t47c23s47-23-105.1ol1b3">
         Option three, known as the 50 percent joint and survivor option, shall consist of a reduced retirement allowance which is payable during the life of the retired member and which, upon his or her death, shall be continued at the rate of one-half the reduced retirement allowance throughout the life of and paid to the designated survivor.

         Option four, known as the pop-up option, shall be the election of options one, two, or three, with the added provision that in the event the designated survivor predeceases the retired member, the retirement allowance payable to the retired member after the death of the designated survivor shall be equal to the maximum retirement allowance which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under this chapter had such election not been made.
