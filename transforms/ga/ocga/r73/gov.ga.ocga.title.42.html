     <p>
      If any inmate of any state or county correctional institution, county or municipal jail, or other similar facility, while such inmate is in custody or in the process of being taken into custody, injures or has injured or contacts or has contacted a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, firefighter, emergency medical technician, or other person in such a manner as to present a possible threat of transmission of a communicable disease to the person so injured or contacted, then the warden, jailer, or other official having charge of such inmate may take all reasonable steps to determine whether the inmate has a communicable disease capable of being transmitted by the injury or contact involved. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, any appropriate medical examination of or collection of medical specimens from the inmate. In the event an inmate refuses to cooperate in any such procedures, the warden, jailer, or other official may apply to the superior court of the county for an order authorizing the use of any degree of force reasonably necessary to complete such procedures. Upon a showing of probable cause that the injury presents the threat of transmission of a communicable disease, the court shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to use reasonable measures to perform any medical procedures reasonably necessary to ascertain whether a communicable disease has been transmitted. In addition to any other grounds sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of such an order, such probable cause may be conclusively established by evidence of the injury or contact in question and a statement by a licensed physician that the nature of the injury or contact is such as to present a threat of transmission of a communicable disease if the inmate has such a disease. The cost of any procedures carried out under this Code section shall be borne by the jurisdiction having custody of the inmate.

   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that alien prisoners subject to deportation are not released from prison into the Georgia community. It is further the intent of this legislative body to reduce the costs and expenses of operating state prisons by reducing the number of alien prisoners incarcerated in the Georgia penal system and to expedite the deportation process of such prisoners. Moreover, Georgia should support the rearrest and revocation of parole of any alien prisoner who reenters the United States in violation of a release on a reprieve with a detainer to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The General Assembly intends to require state agencies to take part in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Rapid Removal of Eligible Parolees Accepted for Transfer (REPAT) Program funded and operated by the United States government and take all measures to fully cooperate and communicate with state, local, and federal agencies for the implementation of such program."

    <p>
     Ga. L. 2006, p. 379,

   1/HB 1059, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds and declares that recidivist sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Many sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and some sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The General Assembly finds that this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. The General Assembly further finds that the high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Incarcerating sexual offenders and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Requiring the registration of sexual offenders, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Collecting data relative to sexual offenses and sexual offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Requiring sexual predators who are released into the community to wear an electronic monitoring system for the rest of their natural life and to pay for such system; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The General Assembly further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual offenders and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual offenders to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual offenders. The General Assembly declares that in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual offenders be registered and that members of the community and the public be notified of a sexual offender's presence. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes. Likewise, the designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from findings by the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board and a court if requested by a sexual offender."

   1-2/SB 8, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "(a) The General Assembly finds that arresting, prosecuting, and incarcerating victimized children serves to retraumatize children and increases their feelings of low self esteem, making the process of recovery more difficult.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that both federal and state laws recognize that sexually exploited children are the victims of crime and should be treated as victims.
   The General Assembly finds that sexually exploited children deserve the protection of child welfare services, including family support, crisis intervention, counseling, and emergency housing services.
   The General Assembly finds that it is necessary and appropriate to adopt uniform and reasonable assessments and regulations to help address the deleterious secondary effects, including but not limited to, prostitution and sexual exploitation of children, associated with adult entertainment establishments that allow the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol on premises and that provide to their patrons performances and interaction involving various forms of nudity.
   The General Assembly finds that a correlation exists between adult live entertainment establishments and the sexual exploitation of children.
   The General Assembly finds that adult live entertainment establishments present a point of access for children to come into contact with individuals seeking to sexually exploit children.
   The General Assembly further finds that individuals seeking to exploit children utilize adult live entertainment establishments as a means of locating children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that many local governments in this state and in other states found deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments are exacerbated by the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol in such establishments.

      <p>
       "(b) The purpose of this Act is to protect a child from further victimization after he or she is discovered to be a sexually exploited child by ensuring that a child protective response is in place in this state.
   The purpose and intended effect of this Act in imposing assessments and regulations on adult entertainment establishments is not to impose a restriction on the content or reasonable access to any materials or performances protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, Section I, Paragraph V of the Constitution of this state."

       Because sexual offender registry requirements are regulatory, and not punitive the registry requirement is not a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; moreover, it is of no consequence whether a defendant has committed an offense that is "sexual" in nature before being required to register since the nature of the offense requiring the registration would not somehow change the registration requirements into a form of "punishment."

       - Trial court's conclusion that the state failed to present any competent evidence showing that the defendant had changed residences was erroneous because in the court's assessment of the evidence, the trial court erroneously determined that an investigator's testimony amounted to inadmissible hearsay; the investigator's testimony as to the declaration of the defendant's father that the defendant no longer lived at that residence was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement and was admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. Moreover, the circumstances presented by the evidence would authorize a rational trier of fact to find that the defendant had intended to change residences without notifying the local authorities as required; the evidence showed that the defendant had been living at the defendant's mother's residence for over two weeks, had not returned to the defendant's father's residence by the time the defendant was arrested, had failed to report for a scheduled meeting with a probation officer, and had not contacted the probation officer to explain the defendant's failure to report for the meeting or to provide any information as to the defendant's current residential status.

       - Trial court erred when the court denied the defendant's petition for release from the requirement to register as a sex offender and failed to determine whether the defendant ever touched a woman who testified at the criminal trial without the woman's consent, thereby committing a sexual offense; thus, since neither the verdict nor the evidentiary ruling in the defendant's case conclusively established that the encounter was a "relevant similar transaction," further proceedings were necessary. Yelverton v. State of Georgia, <cite class="ga_court">300 Ga. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">794 S.E.2d 613</cite> (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court was indeed authorized, after denying the petition to be released from the sex offender registration requirement on one specific ground and being reversed on appeal, to deny the petition a second time for a wholly different reason. Royster v. State of Ga., <cite class="ga_app_court">346 Ga. App. 333</cite>, <cite class="app_court">814 S.E.2d 455</cite> (2018).

        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's request to be released from the sex offender registration requirements as the record showed that the defendant was convicted of an intentional act of aggravated child molestation which resulted in physical injury to the victim when the defendant placed the defendant's finger inside the rectum of a child under the age of 14 years, with the intent to satisfy the sexual desires of the accused, and which resulted in physical injury to the child.

     <p>
      The Governor, upon certification by the commissioner of corrections and approval by the director of the Office of Planning and Budget that the population of the prison system of the State of Georgia has exceeded the capacity of the prison system for any period of 90 consecutive days, beginning at any time after December 31, 1988, may declare a state of emergency with regard to jail and prison overcrowding. Following the declaration of such emergency, the department may establish additional facilities for use by the department, such facilities to be either of a permanent type of construction or of a temporary or movable type as the department may find most advantageous to the particular needs, to the end that the inmates under its supervision may be so distributed throughout the state as to facilitate individualization of treatment designed to prepare them for lawful living in the community where they are most likely to reside after their release from a correctional facility. For this purpose, the department may purchase or lease sites and suitable lands and erect necessary buildings thereon or purchase or lease existing facilities, all within the limits of appropriations as approved by the General Assembly. With the approval of the Governor, provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 50, relating to the Department of Administrative Services, or provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 or Chapter 22 of Title 50, relating to control over acquisition of professional services, may be waived by the department to facilitate the rapid construction or procurement of facilities for inmates; provided, however, that the authority to waive provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 shall terminate as of July 1, 1991.During any year in which correctional facilities are constructed or procured under this Code section and any requirements are waived, the department shall furnish the Governor and the General Assembly with a detailed report specifying the facilities constructed or procured, the requirements waived, and the reasons therefor.

      A county shall be authorized to establish a diversion center under the direction of the sheriff of the county in which the diversion center is located and a diversion program for the confinement of certain individuals who have been found in contempt of court for violation of orders granting temporary or permanent alimony or child support and sentenced pursuant to subsection (c) of Code Section 15-1-4. While in such diversion program, the respondent shall be authorized to travel to and from his or her place of employment and to continue his or her occupation. The official in charge of the diversion program or his or her designee shall prescribe the routes, manner of travel, and periods of travel to be used by the respondent in attending to his or her occupation. If the respondent's occupation requires the respondent to travel away from his or her place of employment, the amount and conditions of such travel shall be approved by the official in charge of the diversion center or his or her designee. When the respondent is not traveling to or from his or her place of employment or engaging in his or her occupation, such respondent shall be confined in the diversion center during the term of the sentence. With the approval of the sheriff or his or her designee, the respondent may participate in educational or counseling programs offered at the diversion center. While participating in the diversion program, such respondent shall be liable for alimony or child support as previously ordered, including arrears, and his or her income shall be subject to the provisions of Code Sections 19-6-30 through 19-6-33.1 and Chapter 11 of Title 19. In addition, should any funds remain after payment of child support or alimony, such respondent may be charged a fee payable to the county operating the diversion program to cover the costs of his or her incarceration and the administration of the diversion program which fee shall be not more than $30.00 per day or the actual per diem cost of maintaining the respondent, whichever is less, for the entire period of time such respondent is confined to the diversion center and participating in the diversion program. If such respondent fails to comply with any of the requirements imposed upon him or her in accordance with this Code section, nothing shall prevent the sentencing judge from revoking such assignment to such diversion program and providing for alternative methods of incarceration.

    - While it is beyond dispute that the sheriff, and not the superior court, is charged with administration of jails, when an issue is properly raised before the trial court regarding jail security or other matters of jail administration and evidence is presented on the issue, the court is empowered to make a determination. Upon a determination that the jail is not secure, the trial court is authorized to order the sheriff to transfer a prisoner to the nearest county having a secure jail.

       - When a prisoner has been placed in the custody of and accepted by a sheriff through the sheriff's deputy, the jailor of the county, and if the prisoner is drunk and as a result of the prisoner's drunkenness sets fire to himself and is burned to death, the sheriff and the sureties on the sheriff's official bond are not liable to the dependents of the deceased prisoner, upon the ground that the jailor was negligent in incarcerating the prisoner in a cell alone without first searching the prisoner and removing from the prisoner's person any object or article with which the prisoner might inflict injury upon himself or others, such as matches, and on the ground that the jailor did not respond to the drunken cries of the prisoner for help. Kendrick v. Adamson, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 402</cite>, <cite class="app_court">180 S.E. 647</cite> (1935).

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the grand jury, at each term of the superior court held in the county, to inquire into the contents of the record kept by the sheriff as required by Code Section 42-4-7. If the record is not kept or is incorrectly kept, the grand jury shall so report to the court. Upon the report's being made, the judge presiding shall cause the district attorney to have the sheriff served with a rule requiring him to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. The judge shall inquire into the facts and, if he finds that Code Section 42-4-7 has not been complied with, he shall impose a fine of not less than $25.00 nor more than $50.00 for the first offense and not more than $100.00 and not less than $50.00 for each subsequent offense. The fines shall be enforced and collected by attachment, as in other cases of attachments against sheriffs.

Therefore, the General Assembly requests and encourages state and local officials with responsibility for the operation of adult and juvenile penal institutions and related facilities to develop policies and procedures which will identify members of criminal street gangs and, where necessary, to separate members and associates of the same criminal street gang in order that such gang members cannot maintain the gang's structure, organization, and discipline and will have a more difficult time in conducting criminal activities while incarcerated in this state."

   1983 claim against the official, following an inmate's death from a Tylenol overdose, because, while the official was aware that the decedent faced a substantial risk of serious harm, the administrators did not show that the official displayed deliberate indifference to the decedent's serious medical needs. Furthermore, the administrators failed to prove that the official was acting outside the scope of the person's official duties or employment; consequently, even if the official acted with malice or intent to injure the decedent, the official was immune from liability on the administrators' state law claims against the official.

       - Evidence supported convictions of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and crossing a prison guard line with drugs when the defendant, a corrections officer, was found with a cookie box containing drugs. Although the defendant claimed to be unaware of the contents of the package, none of the people the defendant named as being involved in the transaction were proven to exist, and the jury was authorized to infer that it was unreasonable for a corrections officer to take a suspicious package from an unknown person into a prison to give to an unknown recipient; furthermore, given the large amount and variety of contraband, its high street value, and that the defendant was taking it inside a heavily guarded prison facility, the jury was authorized to infer that the defendant intended to distribute the drugs to others instead of using the drugs personally.

Hence, the governing authority of a county has no authority to employ an attorney to represent it in a proceeding before the prison commission (now Board of Corrections) for the discharge of a warden.

        <p>
       - Although, as warden, the defendant was permitted to live rent-free in a house located on county property, the county did not benefit from routine use of inmates to perform personal housekeeping chores at the warden's home, as well as to walk the warden's dogs and clean the dog pens, baby-sit the warden's children, and wash the warden's personal vehicles. Inmates who refused to perform these chores were punished.

        Function of the prison commission
       
       (now Board of Corrections) is to enforce sentences that are lawfully imposed, and the question as to whether a court is acting within the court's jurisdiction in modifying a sentence is in nowise affected by this section.

       - Since the defendant was sentenced as a felon upon the defendant's plea of guilty to the felony of making terroristic threats and misdemeanor battery, the court did not have authority to sentence the defendant to a county jail and the county had no authority to calculate the defendant's jail time.

         Language in sentence designating place of incarceration surplusage.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When one guilty of a misdemeanor is sentenced to be "confined at labor at the State Penitentiary (Georgia State Prison) at Reidsville, Georgia, or such other place as the proper authority may direct," such portion of the sentence as seeks to designate the place of confinement, when no effort so to confine the prisoner is shown and since the director of the department of corrections (now commissioner of corrections) designates where most sentences are served, is mere surplusage, and, though technically not in the right form, is not such an irregularity as is hurtful to any right of liberty, or such a defect as makes the sentence void. Mathis v. Scott, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 743</cite>, <cite class="app_court">35 S.E.2d 285</cite> (1945) (decided under Ga. L. 1937, p. 758).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court cannot require the Department of Corrections to place a convicted felon in a particular facility; however, language in a sentence purporting to designate a place of confinement is mere surplusage and is not a defect that will render the sentence void. Stewart v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 760</cite>, <cite class="app_court">647 S.E.2d 411</cite> (2007).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Superior court in this state has the power to order a habeas corpus petitioner under sentence of state court transferred from one penal institution to another, when this is necessary to grant the petitioner's constitutional right to meaningful access to the courts. To the extent that there exists a conflict between the statutory authority vested in the department to transfer prisoners from one correctional institute to another, and the authority vested in the superior court to enforce the Constitution, the former must yield to the latter. James v. Hight, <cite class="ga_court">251 Ga. 563</cite>, <cite class="app_court">307 S.E.2d 660</cite> (1983).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Once a felony conviction was entered, and a defendant was sentenced to incarceration, the trial court lacked the authority to designate where that defendant must serve the incarceration, since this decision lies solely with the Department of Corrections under O.C.G.A.

        - As a general rule, the legislature has designated the Board of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) sole agency for reception and assignment of convicted misdemeanants and felons. Notable exceptions to this general provision concern individuals convicted of misdemeanors who, under certain conditions, must be placed in a county institution and, under other conditions, may be placed in such facilities in the discretion of the trial court; and one notable exception provides that the Division for Children and Youth is designated the exclusive state agency for the acceptance and incarceration of all misdemeanants and felons under the age of 17 years; provided, however, that those felons convicted of a capital felony shall only be sentenced into the custody of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections). 1972 Op.

   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides:
   "The General Assembly finds that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its causative agent, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), pose a grave threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state.
   In the absence of any effective vaccination or treatment for this disease, it threatens almost certain death to all who contract it.
   The disease is largely transmitted through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use, not through casual contact, and, while deadly, is therefore preventable. The key component of the fight against AIDS is education. Through public education and counseling our citizens can learn how the disease is transmitted and, thus, how to protect themselves and prevent its spread.
   The Department of Human Resources is encouraged to continue its efforts to educate all Georgians about the disease, its causative agent, and its means of transmission.
   In addition, voluntary testing should be encouraged for anyone who feels at risk of infection. While education, counseling, and voluntary testing are vital to the elimination of this epidemic, other measures are needed to protect the health of our citizens, and it is the intention of the General Assembly to enact such measures in the exercise of its police powers in order to deal with AIDS and HIV infection."

Such criteria shall require that any participating nonprofit organization be qualified as exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and shall give consideration in determining eligibility to the nonprofit organization's history of service activities and the length of time for which it has been in existence and providing such services. Any such volunteer service program shall include elements whereby the volunteer inmates provide services of benefit to the community while receiving training or work experience suitable for their rehabilitation. The board may authorize such voluntary inmate participation, notwithstanding the fact that the nonprofit organization may receive direct or indirect payment as a result of such inmate participation; notwithstanding the fact that the services rendered may provide some degree of benefit to private individuals or organizations or both; and notwithstanding the fact that some inmate participation may take place outside the confines of a penal institution.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Punishment by forfeiture of good-time allowances for escape is executive punishment and does not prevent prosecution for the same offense in a court of law. Mincey v. Hopper, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 378</cite>, <cite class="app_court">211 S.E.2d 283</cite> (1974) (decided under Ga. L. 1956, p. 161).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There is no merit in the contention that an appellant's good-time allowance could not be forfeited because of the appellant's escape without the appellant's trial in a court of law for the crime of escape. Mincey v. Hopper, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 378</cite>, <cite class="app_court">211 S.E.2d 283</cite> (1974) (decided under Ga. L. 1956, p. 161).

        Probationer is not a prisoner within meaning of section

         Fundamental public policy underlying section
        </b>
        is orderly administration of penitentiary service of prisoners, which is enhanced by a system of rewards in which the prisoner participates through a reduction of time served; the state also benefits through a lessening of ever constant discipline problems. The state receives no benefit by awarding statutory good time to an individual not "in any prison or county public works camp (now county correctional institution) operated under the jurisdiction of the board." This section was passed to benefit both the state and the prisoner. Since the state is not benefited directly when the prisoner is not under the jurisdiction of the board, the application of the provision dealing with statutory good time would be unauthorized. 1963-65 Op. Att'y Gen. p. 143 (decided under Ga. L. 1956, p. 161).

   1983 suit against a county sheriff and state prison warden failed because the inmate's erroneous transfer to prison from the county jail after the inmate was granted an appeal bond in one criminal case did not preclude the inmate from being detained on a bench warrant prior to the trial of a second criminal case; such transfers did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause because the inmate did not present any evidence the inmate's detention at the prison was qualitatively different from the inmate's detention in the jail, and pretrial detention in a prison setting was authorized by O.C.G.A.

    - Ga. L. 1972, p. 932 (see now O.C.G.A.

The agreement has provisions for sanctions if a speedy disposition of the pending indictment is not effected. If trial is not held within 120 days of the arrival of the movant within the jurisdiction of the court in which the indictment is pending and before the movant is returned to the jurisdiction of the sending state, the untried indictment shall be dismissed with prejudice.

      The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, information or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

       Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.

The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.

      Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint, provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by the certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint on which the detainer is based.

      The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated: provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      In respect of any proceeding made possible by this Article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.
     </p>
     <p>
      If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

      In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.
     </p>
     <p>
      The officer or other representative of a State accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:

     <p>
      If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.

       - Trial court properly denied the defendant's plea in bar based on speedy-trial grounds because the defendant's incarceration in Michigan extended the time for the defendant's speedy trial demand as the defendant was not available for trial because the defendant was in the custody of a different sovereign and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, O.C.G.A.

       - Lodging of a detainer by the proper officials of this state against a person serving a term of imprisonment in the correctional institution of a sister state does not violate the provisions of U.S. Const., amends. 6, 8 and 14 or Ga.

       Holding that the state may ignore a prisoner's request until shortly before the expiration of the 180-day period provided in Article III, and then extend that period by initiating proceedings under Article IV, would effectively nullify the purpose of the 180-day provision of Article III and deny to a prisoner the right to a speedy trial.

       - Since the defendant sent the defendant's request for a disposition of the charges directly to the state without a warden's certificate of an inmate's status, rather than through prison authorities, and the required certificate was eventually supplied at a later date, the 180-day period provided in Article III began to run once the state received the certificate rather than when the state received the defendant's direct request.

     - Ga. L. 1985, p. 420, effective March 27, 1985, repealed the Code sections formerly codified at this chapter and enacted the current chapter. The former chapter, which also dealt with treatment of youthful offenders, consisted of Code Sections 42-7-1 through 42-7-16. The former chapter also created the Youthful Offender Division of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (now Department of Corrections) and described that former division's powers and duties. While several provisions of Code sections of the former chapter were carried forward into the new chapter (see historical citations in this chapter), the following Acts formed the basis of Code sections which were not carried forward: Ga.

Therefore, the General Assembly requests and encourages state and local officials with responsibility for the operation of adult and juvenile penal institutions and related facilities to develop policies and procedures which will identify members of criminal street gangs and, where necessary, to separate members and associates of the same criminal street gang in order that such gang members cannot maintain the gang's structure, organization, and discipline and will have a more difficult time in conducting criminal activities while incarcerated in this state."

     - When a youthful offender's conditional release is revoked, and the youth is not returned to the youthful offender program, the youth's status as a youthful offender is terminated and the youth's sentence should be computed on the basis of six years or the maximum term for the offense, if less than six years. 1975 Op.

     When a combination of youthful offender and standard sentences occur,
    
    the Youthful Offender Division may not approve a conditional or unconditional release for the described youthful offender until the youth's concurrent standard sentence had expired; nevertheless, the youth could be assigned to an institution maintained primarily for youthful offenders during the entire period for which the board was charged with custody over the youth, since Ga.

        enjoy a youthful offender status; a parole eligibility date should be established for them, computed on the basis of a six-year determinate sentence, or the maximum potential term for the offense for which the offender was committed, whichever is less. 1975 Op.

        When a combination of youthful offender and standard sentences occur,
       
       the Youthful Offender Division may not approve a conditional or unconditional release for the described youthful offender until the youth's concurrent standard sentence has expired; nevertheless, the youth could be assigned to an institution maintained primarily for youthful offenders during the entire period for which the board is charged with custody over the youth, since former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Labeling an investigative report of the probation department as a "post-sentence" report, as distinguished from a "presentence" report, will not change the report's legal effect when the content, purpose, and function of the report are the same. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).

       - Trial court erred in imposing the maximum sentence with the intent of utilizing a later report to determine the final length of sentence. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - There is no discernible difference between a "presentence" and "post-sentence" report, except as to time of submission, and this is of no import when each is used for the same purpose. Thus, it is permissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or some part of a sentence. For the same reason it is impermissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report in fixing the length of the sentence. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the trial court intended to use the "post-sentence" report to determine the final length of the sentence, it was implicit that the trial court imposed the original sentence with the intent of determining a final length of sentence only after viewing the "post-sentence" investigative report. In such instance, Munford v. State, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 38</cite>, <cite class="app_court">218 S.E.2d 792</cite> (1975) and Mills v. State, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 186</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 445</cite> (1979) proscribed the use of the reports to determine "length" of sentence without compliance with the provisions of former Code 1933,

       - Since the sentence on a charge of abandonment did not specify whether the payments required thereunder were in the nature of a fine or a payment for the support of the defendant's child or children, and failed to specify where or to whom the payments were to be made, this provision of the sentence was too vague and indefinite to be enforceable, and a revocation of the probation sentence solely on the ground that the defendant did not make the payments specified was without authority of law.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Labeling an investigative report of the probation department as a "post-sentence" report, as contra-distinguished from a "presentence" report, will not change the report's legal effect where the content, the purpose, and function of the report are the same.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because there is no discernible difference between a "presentence" and "post-sentence" report, except as to time of submission, this is of no import when each is used for the same purpose. Thus, it is permissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report for the purpose of deciding whether to suspend or probate all or some part of a sentence. For the same reason it is impermissible to use a "presentence" or "post-sentence" report in fixing the length of the sentence. Threatt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the trial court intended to use the "post-sentence" report to determine the final length of the sentence, it was implicit that the trial court imposed the original sentence with the intent of determining a final length of sentence only after viewing the "post-sentence" investigative report. In such instance, Munford v. State, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 38</cite>, <cite class="app_court">218 S.E.2d 792</cite> (1975) and Mills v. State, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 186</cite>, <cite class="app_court">259 S.E.2d 445</cite> (1979), proscribe the use of the reports to determine "length" of sentence without compliance with the provisions of former Code 1933,

       - Because the ability of a defendant to pay a fine is often a factor for the sentencing judge to consider in assessing the likelihood that the defendant will serve a term of probation without violation, a conditionally probated sentence is not necessarily invidious discrimination based on wealth if the sentencing judge has determined that the defendant would not be a good candidate for probation unless a fine is paid first.

       - Trial court has no power to amend and modify a sentence in a criminal case after the term during which the sentence was imposed; accordingly, if the defendant had been sentenced to an indeterminate term in the penitentiary without any provision for probation, the court properly refused to entertain a motion made at a subsequent term that the sentence be modified so as to allow the defendant to serve the sentence on probation.

       - Power of a superior court in a criminal case to amend a sentence during the same term of the court in which the sentence was imposed, by shortening the period of imprisonment, is not lost by entry of the defendant upon the service of such sentence. When, by an amendment so made during the same term, the period of service in the penitentiary, as fixed in a sentence for a reducible felony, is changed to a shorter term in the county correctional institution as for a misdemeanor, the amendment may also provide for service of the misdemeanor sentence, or any remainder thereof, on probation.

In the event the court determines that the defendant does not meet the criteria for such alternatives, the court may revoke the balance of probation or not more than two years in confinement, whichever is less.

   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "The General Assembly finds that the safety of the public is a paramount concern and that prison and jail overcrowding and the high cost of incarceration demand a cost effective and innovative approach to protecting communities from dangerous offenders while at the same time providing alternatives to, or bridges to and from incarceration. Under appropriate conditions and limitations, electronic monitoring devices provide the criminal justice system with a tool that should be considered under proper circumstances. Electronic monitoring devices offer effective means to track individuals and may reduce criminal recidivism as well as provide the state with monetary savings since the cost of an electronic monitoring device is far less than the cost of incarcerating an individual and an individual may be able to pay for the device. The criminal penalties provided by this Act are designed to encourage the use of electronic monitoring devices while at the same time discourage interference with these devices."

        <p>
       - Trial court erred in denying a probationer's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the probationer's apartment as, even though the entry into the apartment for the purpose of effecting an arrest of the probationer was permissible, most of the evidence was seized without a warrant after the probationer was not found in the apartment and had to be excluded under the Fourth Amendment as the search conducted was only permissible insofar as the search involved the observation of items of obvious evidentiary value in plain view during the time and activities required to attempt the probationer's arrest. The probationer was never placed on notice that the probationer was going to be subjected to warrantless searches, and the state failed to demonstrate any exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search.

       Absent inclusion of a record and an express authority to the contrary, the trial judge was authorized to impose attendance at the Chatham County DUI court treatment program as a condition of the defendant's probation; further, imposition was not a denial of the defendant's equal protection rights in that nonresidents were not required to attend, especially and in light of the fact that the defendant failed to show any evidence to show the genesis, nature, or content of the program of which
   the defendant complained. Kellam v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">271 Ga. App. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">608 S.E.2d 729</cite> (2004).

       While the Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant that the cited probation conditions were peculiar to a DUI conviction, because the defendant failed to cite any authority showing that a court abused the court's discretion in imposing the condition's upon a probated sentence for serious injury by vehicle, when DUI was the predicate offense, and the defendant failed to show that any such condition was unreasonable or failed to serve the main goals of probation, the appeals court saw no reason why the cited conditions could not be imposed upon a probated sentence for serious injury by vehicle.

       Although the legislature has expressly provided that banishment is a valid term and condition of probation, the trial court cannot banish a probationer to any area within the state that does not consist of at least one entire judicial circuit. Because Toombs County was part of the five-county Middle Judicial Circuit, which also included Emanuel, Jefferson, Washington, and Candler Counties, the trial court was not statutorily authorized to banish the defendant from the entire state, except for Toombs County.

       - Sentences for criminal offenses should be certain, definite, and free from ambiguity, and, when the contrary is the case, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused. Hence, the trial court erred in revoking a purported probation sentence since construed as a whole, the sentence was an alternative one and the defendant was to be discharged upon payment of fines and costs.

       - Since the court cannot revoke a probated sentence unless the sentence has conditions sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and unless the conditions have not been complied with, and since the defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the charge which is brought against the defendant, only those alleged violations which are terms of the original sentence, and notice of the violation of which has been given the probationer, may be considered by the court on the hearing to revoke the probated sentence.

       Notwithstanding any other terms or conditions of probation which may be imposed, a court may provide that probationers sentenced for felony offenses to a period of time of not less than one year on probation as a condition of probation shall satisfactorily complete a program of confinement in a special alternative incarceration - probation boot camp unit of the Department of Corrections for a period of 120 days computed from the time of initial confinement in the unit; provided, however, that the Department of Corrections may release the defendant upon service of 90 days in recognition of excellent behavior.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1b">
       Before a court may place such condition upon the sentence, an initial investigation shall be completed by the officer which indicates that the probationer is qualified for such treatment in that the individual does not appear to be physically or mentally disabled in a way that would prevent him or her from strenuous physical activity, that the individual has no obvious contagious diseases, that the individual is not less than 17 years of age nor more than 30 years of age at the time of sentencing, and that the Department of Corrections has granted provisional approval of the placement of the individual in the special alternative incarceration - probation boot camp unit.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1c">
       In every case when an individual is sentenced under the terms of this Code section, the sentencing court shall, within its probation order, direct the Department of Corrections to arrange with the sheriff's office in the county of incarceration to have the individual delivered to a designated unit of the Department of Corrections within a specific date not more than 15 days after the issuance of such probation order by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1d">
       At any time during the individual's confinement in the unit, but at least five days prior to his or her expected date of release, the Department of Corrections shall certify to the trial court as to whether the individual has satisfactorily completed the condition of probation provided in subsection (a) of this Code section.

      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1e">
       Upon the receipt of a satisfactory report of performance in the program from the Department of Corrections, the trial court shall release the individual from confinement in the special alternative incarceration - probation boot camp unit. However, the receipt of an unsatisfactory report shall be grounds for revocation of the probated sentence as would any other violation of a condition or term of probation.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-35.1ol1f">
       The satisfactory report of performance in the program from the Department of Corrections shall, in addition to the other requirements specified in this Code section, require participation of the individual confined in the unit in such adult education courses necessary to attain the equivalency of a grade five competency level as established by the State Board of Education for elementary schools. Those individuals who are mentally disabled as determined by initial testing shall be exempt from mandatory participation. After the individual is released from the unit, it shall be a special condition of probation that the individual participate in an education program in the community until grade five level competency is achieved or active probation supervision terminates. It shall be the duty of the Department of Corrections to certify to the trial court that such individual has satisfactorily completed such condition of probation while on active probation supervision. The receipt of an unsatisfactory report may be grounds for revocation of the probated sentence as would any other violation of a condition or term of probation. Under certain circumstances, the probationer may be exempt from this requirement if it is determined by the officer that community education resources are inaccessible to the probationer.

       - It was error to hold that a probationer's failure to abide by the diversion center's regulations made the probationer liable for the felony offense of escape rather than for the mere revocation of the probationer's probation.

        - State probation officer was entitled to qualified immunity as to a probationer's malicious prosecution claim based on the officer's sentence miscalculation because it was not clearly established that the officer's alleged conduct would subject the officer to liability since there were published decisions from the court granting absolute immunity to probation officers who were alleged to have made material misrepresentations that impacted the offender's sentence.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When a person is placed under a probation sentence, probation cannot be revoked without notice to probationer and an opportunity to be heard on the question as to whether the probationer violated its terms. Rainwater v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 406</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 889</cite> (1972).

        Minimum requirements of due process for parole revocation

        Hearing required need not meet the requisites of a jury trial;

       <p>
        <p>

        Judge is the sole trier of fact
       
       and when there is even slight evidence the appellate court will not interfere with the revocation unless there has been an abuse of discretion. Rainwater v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 406</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 889</cite> (1972).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Parole cannot lawfully be revoked as a mere matter of caprice. In such hearing the judge is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses, but the judge is not permitted to withdraw a parole unless there is sufficient evidence to authorize a finding that one or more of the conditions upon which the parole was granted has been violated. Williams v. State, <cite class="ga_court">162 Ga. 327</cite>, <cite class="app_court">133 S.E. 843</cite> (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When it cannot be determined whether the criminal act charged against the probationer as in violation of the probationer's parole was committed prior to the imposition of the sentence or subsequent thereto, a finding revoking the parole would be contrary to law and would not be authorized. Williams v. State, <cite class="ga_court">162 Ga. 327</cite>, <cite class="app_court">133 S.E. 843</cite> (1926).

       - When a probation warrant was returned non est inventus, the tolling function initiated under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) was not interrupted by defendant's arrest on unrelated charges in another county.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-36ol1a2" target="_self">42-8-36(a)(2)</a></cite> after the trial court found that the probation supervisor's affidavit set forth the factual averments required by O.C.G.A.

Vincent v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">271 Ga. App. 138</cite>, <cite class="app_court">608 S.E.2d 748</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

       - It was error to hold that a probationer's failure to abide by the diversion center's regulations made the probationer liable for the felony offense of escape rather than for the mere revocation of the probationer's probation. Unsatisfactory performance in the program would subject the probationer to revocation of probation as specified by O.C.G.A.

       - That the quantum of proof necessary to revoke probation has been changed from "slight evidence" to "a preponderance of the evidence" does not affect the rule that a ruling in favor of the probationer, continuing rather than revoking probation, has no collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent criminal trial.

       - After the defendant received a sentence which unambiguously revoked the defendant's prior probation, the defendant fully served the time imposed therein, and there was no indication in the sentence that any portion of the defendant's probation was to be reinstated upon the defendant's release, that sentence was fully satisfied when the defendant was released from jail, and the court's order subsequently revoking the defendant's probation was invalid as there was nothing left to revoke.

       When a convicted defendant's "future good behavior" has already been compromised by the commission of another criminal act even before the formal probationary period begins, a trial court should not be required to allow such defendant to serve a previously imposed probated sentence when the court deems that protection of society demands revocation.

        <p>
       - Trial court erred in denying a probationer's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the probationer's apartment as, even though the entry into the apartment for the purpose of effecting an arrest of the probationer was permissible, most of the evidence seized without a warrant after the probationer was not found in the apartment had to be excluded under the Fourth Amendment as the search conducted was only permissible insofar as the search involved the observation of items of obvious evidentiary value in plain view during the time and activities required to attempt the probationer's arrest. The probationer was never placed on notice that the probationer was going to be subjected to warrantless searches, and the state failed to demonstrate any exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search.

       Judge in the Dublin judicial circuit had jurisdiction to revoke a former prisoner's probation because: (1) while the prisoner pled guilty in the Macon judicial circuit and the prisoner's sentence was probated, the prisoner was involved in a theft which resulted in a partial revocation of probation and assignment to a probation detention center in the Dublin judicial circuit and, during the prisoner's confinement in the Dublin judicial circuit, the prisoner violated the terms of the prisoner's probation; and (2) because the prisoner was under supervision in a judicial circuit other than that of the prisoner's conviction, the prisoner was properly returned to a court of equivalent original criminal jurisdiction within the county wherein the prisoner was residing for the purposes of supervision under O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Following technical violations of the conditions of probation, short of conviction for another crime or a determination of initial ineligibility, the trial court had discretion to continue a first offender on probation without first revoking first offender status, entering an adjudication of guilt, or resentencing for the underlying offense.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the court cannot revoke a probated sentence unless that sentence has conditions sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and unless those conditions have not been complied with, and since the defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the charge which is brought against the defendant, only those alleged violations which are terms of the original sentence, and notice of the violation of which has been given the probationer, may be considered by the court on the hearing to revoke the probated sentence.

       <p>
        - Because parole and probation revocation proceedings are not designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law and, because the purpose of parole and probation revocation proceedings is to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of the probationer's parole or probation, such proceedings are fundamentally distinguishable from juvenile proceedings, the latter being indistinguishable from a criminal prosecution, and, thus, the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const., amend. 5 does not apply to parole and probation revocation proceedings.

       Although this section does not require it, "a written statement by the fact finders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking probation" has been established as a minimum due process requirement in assuring the constitutional rights of an individual who will be condemned to suffer grievous loss by restraint of liberty.

       In order to revoke the probationary features of a sentence the defendant must have notice and opportunity to be heard, the notice being sufficient to inform the defendant not only of the time and place of the hearing and the fact that revocation is sought, but the grounds upon which it is based.

        <p>
       - Hearing of this character is not a trial on a criminal charge, but is a hearing to judicially determine whether the conduct of the defendant during the probation period has conformed to the course outlined in the order of probation. If the act which violated the probation should happen to be a criminal one, it does not thereby change the character of the hearing. Sparks v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">77 Ga.

       - If an affiant shows ample facts to authorize the issuing magistrate to conclude that there is probable cause to believe that a crime of the nature set forth in the affidavits has been committed and that evidence of the crime would be produced by a search of the premises described in the affidavits, the fact that much of the affiant's information is derived from informants will not vitiate the warrant.

       - It was general practice in Georgia for a warrant to be issued by a court on a written petition calling to the court's attention the alleged delinquency of a probationer, but the only requirement was that the defendant receive "due examination," which means that the defendant be given notice and an opportunity to be heard, and there being no requirement that the proceeding be initiated by written petition of the solicitor general (now district attorney), technical defects in such a petition when filed would not vitiate the warrant issued by the court or subsequent proceedings thereon, provided the requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard are complied with.

       - Violation of the conditions of probation must be established with reasonable certainty so as to satisfy the conscience of the court of the truth of the violation.

       - Court may, at the time of sentencing, specify the amount to be paid by the parent for the support of the minor child and may suspend the service of the sentence pending the minority of the child. When the child reaches majority, the sentence of course is at an end. However, service of any sentence so suspended in abandonment cases may be ordered at any time before the child reaches the age of 21. However, when a sentence is merely probated, the probationary feature of the sentence ends when the elapsed time equals the maximum sentence of confinement which could have been imposed. Entrekin v.

         Effect of suspension of part of sentence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        - In the imposition of a sentence, if the trial court suspends service of part of sentence, the provision for suspension shall not have the effect of placing the defendant on probation; thus, once a probated sentence is revoked and the probationer has been sentenced to a definite period of years of imprisonment and the remainder of the defendant's sentence has been suspended, this sentence does not have the effect of placing the defendant on probation and, therefore, such sentence cannot be revoked. 1968 Op.

      Sentence admissible in murder trial.

    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - At the sentencing phase of a murder trial, the state offered in aggravation an indictment, the defendant's plea of guilty to the indictment, and a sentence imposed under O.C.G.A. Art. 3, Ch. 8, T. 42 for the offenses of entering an automobile and theft by taking. This evidence was admissible, since evidence in aggravation is not limited to convictions, and reliable information tending to show a defendant's general bad character is admissible in aggravation.

       After a defendant was convicted for statutory rape, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to resentence the defendant as a first offender or to rescind the conviction or confinement portion of the sentence.

       - If an offender does not take advantage of an opportunity for rehabilitation, the offender's trial which has been suspended is continued and an adjudication of guilt is made and a sentence entered. State v. Wiley, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">210 S.E.2d 790</cite> (1974).

        <p>
       Better practice would be to introduce evidence of the criminal offense underlying the conviction as well as a certified copy of the conviction itself. If that is done, the fact that the conviction is reversed on appeal because of error, or because the evidence does not support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, will not vitiate a revocation of probation properly based on slight evidence of the criminal offense. Crawford v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 272</cite>, <cite class="app_court">304 S.E.2d 443</cite> (1983).

VI to cross-examine the witness regarding the witness's first offender probation status to show bias, but the records relevant to that status were not admissible because there was no adjudication of the witness's guilt; the error, however, was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.

       - When no adjudication of guilt had been made and no prior sentence had been entered, it is clear that if an individual on probation under the First Offender Act violates the terms of the individual's probation or is convicted for another crime, the trial court may enter an adjudication of guilt and impose any sentence permitted by law for the offense the individual has been found guilty of committing.

       By committing a new crime, defendant lost the benefit of first offender status, and the unadjudicated guilt in connection with the prior state offense was properly considered a prior conviction for purposes of sentencing under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, which pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual

       Trial court did not err in increasing the sentence originally imposed upon the defendant because the defendant was informed when the first offender probation sentence was pronounced that, upon an adjudication of guilt, the defendant could be sentenced to the maximum allowable under the law; although the sentencing form was ambiguous since both the first offender treatment box and the felony sentence box were checked the ambiguity in the form was not fatal to the trial court's imposition of a sentence greater than the original one.

       - Trial court did not err in increasing the sentence originally imposed upon the defendant because the defendant was informed when the first offender probation sentence was pronounced that, upon an adjudication of guilt, the defendant could be sentenced to the maximum allowable under the law; although the sentencing form was ambiguous since both the first offender treatment box and the felony sentence box were checked, the ambiguity in the form was not fatal to the trial court's imposition of a sentence greater than the original one.

   ยง
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t42c08s42-8-60" target="_self">42-8-60</a></cite> et seq., the trial court properly prohibited a defendant from impeaching a witness with a forgery offense. The defendant cited no authority in support of the argument that this violated the defendant's rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, and the court held that impeachment to show a general lack of trustworthiness based on a prior criminal conviction was not guaranteed by the confrontation clause. Butler v. State, <cite class="ga_court">285 Ga. 518</cite>, <cite class="app_court">678 S.E.2d 92</cite> (2009).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Evidence of a first offender's guilty plea is not admissible for the purpose of impeaching a witness by showing the witness to have been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, even though it is admissible in a civil trial to impeach an adverse witness by disproving or contradicting the witness's testimony.

        - Section did not provide for "rehabilitation" within the meaning of Rule 609(c), Fed. R. Evid., which prohibits evidence of a prior conviction for purposes of impeachment if the conviction has been the subject of a "rehabilitation." Wilson v.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court erred in admitting testimony and documents concerning defendant's entry of the first-offender guilty plea to commercial gambling since the defendant was still on probation at the time of the condemnation trial, and because it was not used for impeachment purposes, its use was prohibited. Jones v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">212 Ga. App. 682</cite>, <cite class="app_court">442 S.E.2d 880</cite> (1994).

       Defendant's guilty plea to an offense for which the defendant received first-offender treatment should not have been admitted as evidence that the defendant committed a similar independent offense.

       Trial court did not err in allowing the state to impeach the defendant's girlfriend using the girlfriend's first-offender plea because the state did not use the girlfriend's guilty plea to impeach the girlfriend's general credibility, but instead used it to show bias through evidence that the defendant had previously attempted to accept responsibility for the girlfriend's criminal conduct in a different matter, and the trial court acted well within the court's discretion in allowing the state to explore whether the defendant's previous attempt to accept responsibility for the girlfriend's criminal conduct might have influenced the girlfriend's trial testimony.

       - Defendant's convictions for armed robbery, aggravated assault, and kidnapping of a couple in a residence were reversed on appeal. Evidence that one victim was ordered from a standing to a lying position and that another was dragged around the home was insufficient to establish asportation to support the kidnapping counts. The defendant's convictions for armed robbery and aggravated assault were reversed as the defendant established ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel's failure to object to the inadmissible hearsay statements of two witnesses and the admission of improper impeachment evidence against the defendant regarding a crime for which the defendant was never adjudicated guilty for as a result of being a first offender.

   The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1)
   The authorization for county and municipal probation offices and private probation services was enacted to provide cost savings to the state by using state probation services for felony offenders and utilizing county and municipal probation offices and private probation entities which contract with courts for the supervision of misdemeanor and county and city ordinance offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2)
   In enacting such legislation, the General Assembly intended to authorize judges to use county and municipal probation offices and private probation services providers to supervise misdemeanor and county and city ordinance offenders in the same manner as the judges of the superior courts use state probation services as a means of supervising felony offenders;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3)
   The General Assembly did not intend to restrict the powers of judges to impose, suspend, toll, revoke, or otherwise manage the probation of misdemeanor and county and city ordinance offenders sentenced in such courts when utilizing county and municipal probation offices and private probation services providers; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4)
   The General Assembly intended that county and municipal probation officers and private probation officers, when acting in performance of their official duties in supervising probationers in accordance with law and the orders of a court, would have the same rights, authority, and protections as state probation supervisors.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b)
   It is the intention of the General Assembly to improve the use and provision of probation services by courts for misdemeanor and ordinance violations by enacting this part."

        Requirement for payment of probation supervision fees by probationers to private probation services company did not violate the separation of powers since the imposition of the fees pursuant to contract constituted a civil fee for services, not a criminal punishment. Furthermore, the mere act of privatizing probation services did not violate the Georgia Constitution since a probation services company was not authorized to deprive probationers of property or liberty without due process, the private probation services were not fundamentally unfair, and the sentencing court continued to oversee the probation process.

       - Georgia Supreme Court answered two questions certified to it from a federal district court and concluded, as a matter of common law, that the mere passage of time does not extinguish an unserved sentence and that the common law principle has not been abrogated by the State-wide Probation Act, O.C.G.A.

       As used in this Code section, the term "pay-only probation" means a defendant has been placed under probation supervision solely because such defendant is unable to pay the court imposed fines and statutory surcharges when such defendant's sentence is imposed. Such term shall not include circumstances when restitution has been imposed or other probation services are deemed appropriate by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-103ol1b">
       When pay-only probation is imposed, the total maximum fee collected shall be capped so as not to exceed three months of ordinary probation supervision fees at a monthly rate not to exceed the rate set forth in the contract between the court and the provider of services, notwithstanding the number of cases for which a fine and statutory surcharge were imposed or that the defendant was sentenced to serve consecutive sentences; provided, however, that collection of such fee shall terminate as soon as all court imposed fines and statutory surcharges are paid in full; and provided, further, that when all such fines and statutory surcharges are paid in full, the probation officer or private probation officer, as the case may be, shall submit an order to the court terminating the probated sentence within 30 days of fulfillment of such conditions. Within 90 days of receiving such order, the court shall issue an order terminating such probated sentence or issue an order stating why such probated sentence shall continue.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-103ol1c">
       If pay-only probation is subsequently converted to a sentence that requires community service, on petition by a probation officer or private probation officer and with the probationer having an opportunity for a hearing, the court may reinstate probation supervision fees as necessary to monitor the probationer's compliance with community service obligations.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c08s42-8-103ol1d">
       When a defendant is serving pay-only probation, upon motion by the defendant, the court may discharge such defendant from further supervision or otherwise terminate probation when it is satisfied that its action would be in the best interest of justice and the welfare of society.

       The 2012 amendment,
      </b>
      effective January 1, 2013, substituted the present provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the former provisions, which read: "(a) In any case where the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation on a resident of this state whose driving privilege is not suspended or revoked, the court shall require the person to surrender his or her driver's license to the court immediately and provide proof of compliance with such order to the court or the probation officer and obtain an ignition interlock device restricted driving license within 30 days. Upon expiration of the period of time for which such person is required to use an ignition interlock device, the person may apply for and receive a regular driver's license upon payment of the fee provided for in Code Section 40-5-25. If such person fails to provide proof of installation to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 and receipt of the restricted driving license within such period, absent a finding by the court of good cause for that failure, which finding is entered in the court's record, the court shall revoke or terminate the probation.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b)(1) In any case where the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation on a resident of this state whose driving privilege is suspended or revoked, the court shall require the person to provide proof of compliance with such order to the court or the probation officer and the Department of Driver Services not later than ten days after the date on which such person first becomes eligible to apply for an ignition interlock device limited driving permit in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or a habitual violator's probationary license in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection, whichever is applicable. If such person fails to provide proof of installation to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 within the period required by this subsection, absent a finding by the court of good cause for that failure, which finding is entered on the court's record, the court shall revoke or terminate the probation if such is still applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) If the person subject to court ordered use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation is authorized under Code Section 40-5-63 or 40-5-67.2 to apply for reinstatement of his or her driver's license during the period of suspension, such person shall, prior to applying for reinstatement of the license, have an ignition interlock device installed and shall maintain such ignition interlock device in a motor vehicle or vehicles to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 for a period of six months running concurrently with that of an ignition interlock device limited driving permit, which permit shall not be issued until such person submits to the department proof of completion of a DUI Alcohol or Drug Use Risk Reduction Program, proof of having undergone any clinical evaluation and of having enrolled in any substance abuse treatment program required by Code Section 40-5-63.1, and proof of installation of an ignition interlock device on a vehicle or vehicles to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111. Such a person may apply for and be issued an ignition interlock device limited driving permit at the end of 12 months after the suspension of the driver's license. At the expiration of such six-month ignition interlock device limited driving permit, the driver may, if otherwise qualified, apply for reinstatement of a regular driver's license upon payment of the fee provided in Code Section 40-5-25.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) If the person subject to court ordered use of an ignition interlock device as a condition of probation is authorized under Code Section 40-5-58 or under Code Section 40-5-67.2 to obtain a habitual violator's probationary license, such person shall, if such person is a habitual violator as a result of two or more convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, have an ignition interlock device installed and maintained in a motor vehicle or vehicles to the extent required by subsection (a) of Code Section 42-8-111 for a period of six months following issuance of the probationary license, and such person shall not during such six-month period drive any motor vehicle that is not so equipped, all as conditions of such probationary license. Following expiration of such six-month period with no violation of the conditions of the probationary license, the person may apply for a habitual violator probationary license without such ignition interlock device condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) In any case where installation of an ignition interlock device is required, failure to show proof of such device shall be grounds for refusal of reinstatement of such license or issuance of such habitual violator's probationary license or the immediate suspension or revocation of such license."

       - Ga. Const. 1945, Art. V, Sec. I, Para XI enumerating powers and duties of the board does not make provision for, or reference to, qualifications of members of the board at the time of their appointment. The qualifications of members of the board would, therefore, be controlled by the general provisions of the Constitution and statutory laws limiting the rights of citizens to hold public office. McLendon v. Everett, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 713</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 119</cite> (1949).

       - There is nothing in the statutory provisions, defining powers and duties of members of State Board of Pardons and Paroles, which provides that doing certain acts by a member would operate as a forfeiture of the member's office.

       There being no statutory provision that a member of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles should forfeit the member's office if the member engaged in any other business or profession, or held any public office, during the member's service upon the board, quo warranto is not the proper remedy to determine whether or not there has been an act of forfeiture.

       <p>
        - Management and control is vested in State Board of Pardons and Paroles and not in individual members, or in any one individual officer. In the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, when official authority is conferred upon the board or commission composed of three or more persons, such authority may be exercised by a majority of the members of the board, but it may not be exercised by a single member of such a board, or by a minority. 1945-47 Op.

        - Chair of the board is the proper parliamentary officer to preside at meetings of the board for the purpose of directing or regulating proceedings and seeing that meetings or hearings are conducted in an orderly manner. The chair of the board, however, by virtue of such office or of the chair's title, does not acquire authority to perform the powers and duties vested by the General Assembly in the State Board of Pardons and Paroles. 1945-47 Op.

        - Except for supervision of parolees and assignment to the Department of Offender Rehabilitation (Corrections) for administrative purposes only, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles retains the board's quasi-judicial functions and powers as a result of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1972 (Ga.

       - Statute does not declare that, if a member of the board shall serve as a representative of a political party, or engage in any other business or profession, the member shall thereby forfeit the member's office. The General Assembly might have provided that a member of the Democratic executive committee could not be appointed as a member of the board, and might have declared a member of the committee to be ineligible for appointment on the board. The legislature did not do this. The legislature provided that a member of the board should not serve as an executive officer or employee of any political committee. McLendon v.

        State supreme court vacated the trial court's judgment denying an inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus
       
       challenging procedures used by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles when the Board revoked the inmate's parole because the recommendation submitted by the Board member who heard the allegations was not a part of the record and there was no evidence in the record which allowed the court to determine the basis of absent Board members' decisions to accept that recommendation and what procedures were followed in revoking the inmate's parole.

       - Trial court erred by requiring the defendant to waive the defendant's Fourth Amendment right as a condition of parole since "any attempt by a court to impose its will over the Executive Department by attempting to impose as a part of a criminal sentence conditions operating as a prerequisite of or becoming automatically effective in the event of a subsequent parole of defendant by the State Board of Pardons and Parole would be a nullity and constitute an exercise of power granted exclusively to the Executive." Stephens v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">207 Ga. App. 645</cite>, <cite class="app_court">428 S.E.2d 661</cite> (1993).
       </p>

       Trial court did not err in denying parolee's petition for writ of mandamus to lift parole conditions requiring electronic monitoring and that the parolee get sex offender counseling as the electronic monitoring condition had been lifted by the time the trial court held a hearing on that condition and the parole board did not act in an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable manner in imposing the counseling condition as the parolee's offenses, while they were not sexually violent offenses, had sexual overtones; thus, the parole board acted consistent with the board's primary goal of protecting society.

         Impact of parole officers and board's actions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Parole board was responsible for maintaining a complete record on any person who came under the power of the board and that record included the nature and term of the individual's sentence; furthermore, it was the parole board that has the power to set the terms and conditions of parole. Thus, the acts of the parole officer, or those within the parole board who make such determinations, in setting the expiration dates of plaintiff's parole, served to break the chain of causation with respect to any error that might have flowed from the misstatement in the parole officer's motion; the parole officer had no power to increase plaintiff's sentence and no power to set the terms of plaintiff's parole. Morgan v. Yarbrough,
   F. Supp. 2d
   (M.D. Ga. Apr. 30, 2008).

        - Presence of "unfettered discretion" in the clemency process does not render the imposition of the death penalty on the defendant arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The discretion involved at the clemency stage can never cause the imposition of the death sentence; it serves only as an act of grace to relieve that sentence even when the sentence has been legally imposed.

   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly finds that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its causative agent, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), pose a grave threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. In the absence of any effective vaccination or treatment for this disease, it threatens almost certain death to all who contract it. The disease is largely transmitted through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use, not through casual contact, and, while deadly, is therefore preventable. The key component of the fight against AIDS is education. Through public education and counseling our citizens can learn how the disease is transmitted and, thus, how to protect themselves and prevent its spread. The Department of Human Resources is encouraged to continue its efforts to educate all Georgians about the disease, its causative agent, and its means of transmission. In addition, voluntary testing should be encouraged for anyone who feels at risk of infection. While education, counseling, and voluntary testing are vital to the elimination of this epidemic, other measures are needed to protect the health of our citizens, and it is the intention of the General Assembly to enact such measures in the exercise of its police powers in order to deal with AIDS and HIV infection."

       - Because a prior district court order only required that the inmate be considered for parole annually under the rules in effect at the time of the inmate's offense, and neither the order nor the rule in effect at the time of the inmate's offense required interviews, the members of Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles complied with the order; and, while the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit included interviews in the list of actions encompassed by "parole reconsideration hearing," the Eleventh Circuit did not hold that an in-person interview was mandated, and O.C.G.A.

        - Parole board was responsible for maintaining a complete record on any person who came under the power of the board and that record included the nature and term of the individual's sentence; furthermore, it was the parole board that has the power to set the terms and conditions of parole. Thus, the acts of the parole officer, or those within the parole board who make such determinations, in setting the expiration dates of plaintiff's parole, served to break the chain of causation with respect to any error that might have flowed from the misstatement in the parole officer's motion; the parole officer had no power to increase the plaintiff's sentence and no power to set the terms of the plaintiff's parole.

However, if there should be a judicial determination that retrospective application is prohibited, it is the intention of the General Assembly that retrospective application should be severable." This Act became effective May 11, 2007.

   1/SB 136, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that alien prisoners subject to deportation are not released from prison into the Georgia community. It is further the intent of this legislative body to reduce the costs and expenses of operating state prisons by reducing the number of alien prisoners incarcerated in the Georgia penal system and to expedite the deportation process of such prisoners. Moreover, Georgia should support the rearrest and revocation of parole of any alien prisoner who reenters the United States in violation of a release on a reprieve with a detainer to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The General Assembly intends to require state agencies to take part in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Rapid Removal of Eligible Parolees Accepted for Transfer (REPAT) Program funded and operated by the United States government and take all measures to fully cooperate and communicate with state, local, and federal agencies for the implementation of such program."

       Whenever a parolee or conditional releasee is arrested on a warrant issued by a member of the board for an alleged violation of parole or conditional release, an informal preliminary hearing in the nature of a court of inquiry shall be held at or near the place of the alleged violation. However, a preliminary hearing is not required if the parolee or conditional releasee is not under arrest on a warrant issued by the board, has absconded from supervision, has signed a waiver of a preliminary hearing, has admitted any alleged violation to any representative of the board in the presence of a third party who is not a representative of the board, or has been convicted of any crime in a federal court or in a court of this state or of another state.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1b">
       The proceeding shall commence within a reasonable time after the arrest of the parolee or conditional releasee. Its purpose shall be to determine whether there is probable cause or reasonable grounds to believe that the arrested parolee or conditional releasee has committed acts which would constitute a violation of his parole or conditional release.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1c">
       The preliminary hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by the board, who shall be some officer who is not directly involved in the case. It shall be the duty of the officer conducting the hearing to make a summary or digest, which may be in the form of a tape recording, of what transpires at the hearing in terms of the testimony and other evidence given in support of or against revocation. In addition, the officer shall state the reasons for his decision that probable cause for revocation does or does not exist and shall indicate the evidence relied upon.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1d">
       It shall be the responsibility of the officer selected to conduct the preliminary hearing to provide the alleged violator with written notice of the time and place of the proceeding, its purpose, and the violations which have been alleged. This notice shall allow a reasonable time for the alleged violator to prepare his case.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1e">
       The officer selected to conduct the preliminary hearing shall have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses resident within the county of the alleged violation after notice of 24 hours. The subpoenas shall be issued without discrimination between public and private parties. When a subpoena is disobeyed, any party may apply to the superior court of the county in which the hearing provided for by this Code section is held for an order requiring obedience. Failure to comply with the order shall be cause for punishment as for contempt of court. The manner of service of subpoenas and costs of securing the attendance of witnesses, including fees and mileage, shall be determined, computed, and assessed in the same manner as is prescribed by law for cases in the superior court.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1f">
       The officer selected to conduct the preliminary hearing shall also have power to issue subpoenas for the production of documents or other written evidence at the hearing provided for by this Code section; but upon written request made promptly and before the hearing, the officer may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive or may condition denial of the request upon the advancement by the person in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost of producing the documents or other written evidence. Enforcement of the subpoenas may be sought in the same manner as is provided in subsection (e) of this Code section for subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1g">
       At the hearing, the alleged violator may appear and speak in his own behalf, may present witnesses to testify in his behalf, and may bring letters, documents, or any other relevant information to the hearing officer. He shall also have the right to cross-examine those who have given adverse information at the preliminary hearing relating to the alleged violation, provided that the hearing officer may refuse to allow such questioning if he determines that the informant would be subjected to risk of harm if his identity were disclosed.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1h">
       Should the hearing officer determine that probable cause for revocation exists, he shall then determine whether the alleged violator should be incarcerated pending his final revocation hearing or whether he should be set free on his personal recognizance pending that hearing. If an alleged violator who is set free on his personal recognizance subsequently fails to appear at his final hearing, the board may summarily revoke his parole or conditional release.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c09s42-9-50ol1i">
       The decision of the hearing officer as to probable cause for revocation shall not be binding on the board but may be either ratified or overruled by majority vote of the board. In the event that the board overrules a determination of the hearing officer that probable cause did not exist, the board shall then determine whether the alleged violator should be incarcerated pending his final hearing or whether he should be set free on his personal recognizance pending that hearing. If an alleged violator who is set free on personal recognizance subsequently fails to appear at his final hearing, the board may summarily revoke his parole or conditional release. Where a hearing officer has determined, after finding probable cause, that the alleged violator should be set free on his personal recognizance, the board may overrule that decision and order the alleged violator to be incarcerated pending his final hearing.

       <p>
        - Because parole and probation revocation proceedings are not designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law, and because the purpose of parole and probation revocation proceedings is to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of the parolee's parole or probation, such proceedings are fundamentally distinguishable from juvenile proceedings, the latter being indistinguishable from a criminal prosecution, and, thus, the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const., amend. 5 does not apply to parole and probation revocation proceedings.

        State supreme court vacated the trial court's judgment denying an inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus
       
       challenging procedures used by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles when the Board revoked the inmate's parole because the recommendation submitted by the Board member who heard the allegations was not a part of the record and there was no evidence in the record which allowed the court to determine the basis of absent Board members' decisions to accept that recommendation and what procedures were followed in revoking the inmate's parole.

       - When a prisoner serving sentence on parole under order of the board is convicted and sentenced to serve time for another criminal offense, the time the prisoner serves on a latter sentence will be computed as time served on the sentence for which the prisoner was paroled, until such time as the board by order revokes the prisoner's parole. Even though warrant is issued for arrest of parolee as parole violator and the parolee arrested, service of the parolee's sentence continues until the board issues an order of revocation and for the parolee's return to prison.

        - Parole, if properly granted in accordance with law and rules and regulations of the board, may be revoked only after a hearing before the board on a specific charge of violating the terms and conditions of parole except in the event the parolee becomes convicted of a crime or enters a plea of guilty to a crime in which case this section provides for revocation by the board without a hearing. However, there need not always be a parole violation before a parole may be revoked. For instance, the authority of a parole board to revoke a parole on the ground that the prisoner had not earned it and was mistakenly granted has been upheld. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-51.

Section 1 reads as follows: "The General Assembly recognizes that the number of persons convicted of crimes in the State of Georgia and sentenced to serve terms of imprisonment in the state prison system has increased greatly in recent years; that, under the moral requirements of humane treatment for prisoners, there is a limit to the present capacity of penal institutions comprising the prison system of the State of Georgia; that, because of the limited present capacity of the state penal system, there is a resulting crisis in overcrowding of local jail and detention facilities due to the backlog of convicted persons awaiting transfer to the state prison system; that the delay in time required to construct new state prison facilities in order to increase the capacity of the state prison system would cause little present relief of the crisis of overcrowding which exists in jail and local detention facilities; that there is an uncertainty as to future needs for additional capacity in the state prison system if alternatives to incarceration are adequately developed and utilized after the present crisis has passed; that there is an uncertainty as to the necessity for local governments to build additional bed space in jails and local detention facilities at their own expense to alleviate the present overcrowding crisis if the present state capacity may be better utilized to relieve that crisis; and, finally, that the release of state prison inmates not otherwise eligible for release on parole is necessary to alleviate the overcrowded prison system during a declared emergency. It is the purpose of this Act to authorize the Governor and the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to remedy an emergency with regard to the overcrowding of the state prison system."

      The Governor of this state is authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the State of Georgia with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

       "ARTICLE I.
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       PURPOSE.
      </h5>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the By-laws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112(1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no 'right' of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and By-laws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

        </p>
        <p>
         Each Member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that Compacting State is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission. A Member shall vote in person on behalf of the state and shall not delegate a vote to another member state. However, a State Council shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the member state at a specified meeting. The By-laws may provide for Members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone, or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where members are present in person.
        </p>

The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests. In promulgating such Rules, the Interstate Commission may make available to law enforcement agencies records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with law enforcement agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the Rules or as otherwise provided in the Compact. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate Rules consistent with the principles contained in the 'Government in Sunshine Act,' 5 U.S.C. Section 552(b), as may be amended. The Interstate Commission and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public where it determines by two-thirds vote that an open meeting would be likely to:

         For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the Interstate Commission's chief legal officer shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision. The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any rollcall vote (reflected in the vote of each Member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of offenders as directed through its By-laws and Rules which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Article and the By-laws and Rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.S. Section 551, et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C.S. app. 2, Section 1, et seq., as may be amended (hereinafter 'APA').
        </p>
        <p>
         All Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a majority of the legislatures of the Compacting States rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compacting State.
        </p>
        <p>
         When promulgating a Rule, the Interstate Commission shall:
        </p>
        <p>
         Not later than sixty days after a Rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such Rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, as defined in the APA, in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subjects to be addressed within 12 months after the first meeting must at a minimum include:
        </p>

         The existing rules governing the operation of the previous compact superceded by this Act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that an emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall oversee the interstate movement of adult offenders in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in Non-compacting States which may significantly affect Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         The courts and executive agencies in each Compacting State shall enforce this Compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compacting State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section B. Dispute Resolution
        </p>
        <p>
         The Compacting States shall report to the Interstate Commission on issues or activities of concern to them, and cooperate with and support the Interstate Commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues which are subject to the Compact and which may arise among Compacting States and Noncompacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall enact a By-law or promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section C. Enforcement
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XII, Section B, of this compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section D. Extradition
        </p>
        <p>
         In accordance with the laws of the United States, the duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the offender to be retaken. All legal requirements to extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such offenders. The decision of the sending state to retake an offender shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; however, if at the time when a state seeks to retake an offender there should be pending against the offender within the receiving state any criminal charge, or if the offender should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the offender shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states that are parties to this compact without interference.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each Compacting State to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each Compacting State and shall promulgate a Rule binding upon all Compacting States which governs said assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its By-laws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than 35 of the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2002, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other Compacting State, upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of Non-member states or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a non-voting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact ('Withdrawing State') by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.
        </p>
        <p>
         The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section B. Default
        </p>
        <p>
         If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted ('Defaulting State') in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the By-laws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
        </p>
        <p>
         The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission By-laws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.
        </p>
        <p>
         Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the state council of such termination.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section C. Judicial Enforcement
        </p>
        <p>
         The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and By-laws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section D. Dissolution of Compact
        </p>
        <p>
         The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the By-laws.
        </p>
        <p>
         The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.
        </p>
        <p>
         The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section A. Other Laws
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         All Compacting States' laws conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section B. Binding Effect of the Compact
        </p>
        <p>
         All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules and By-laws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States.
        </p>
        <p>
         All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective."

        Each receiving State shall provide regular reports to each sending State on the inmates of that sending State in institutions pursuant to this Compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending State, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending State and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending State.

        All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this Compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with similar inmates of the receiving State as may be confined in the same institution.

The receiving State shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending State. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving State, the governing law shall be that of the sending State and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending State shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending State.

        <p>
         Any State party to this Compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this Compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving State pursuant to this Compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving States have made contractual provisions; provided, that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, express consent of the appropriate official of the sending State shall be required therefor.

         This Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party State until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the Compact to the appropriate officials of all other party States. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing State from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing State shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this Compact.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party State may have with a non-party State for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party State authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any State participating therein, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining States and in full force and effect as to the State affected as to all severable matters.

      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a State party to this Compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party State is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party State, the receiving State to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The appropriate officials of any State party to this Contract shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.

       STATE; EXTRADITION.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any decision of the sending State in respect to any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this Compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving State, but if at the time the sending State seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving State there is pending against the inmate within such State any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such State a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving State until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending State shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this Compact through any and all States party to this Compact without interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this Compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending State and from the State in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving State the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending State, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

      The General Assembly makes the following findings and determinations:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c12s42-12-2ol11">
       The costs of litigation are rising dramatically. It is the responsibility of this body to seek out and adopt measures to rectify this situation. One source of the rise in litigation costs is frivolous prisoner lawsuits. Meritless lawsuits are being filed at an ever-increasing rate by prisoners who view litigation as a recreational exercise. To address the problems caused by the filing of nonmeritorious lawsuits and to relieve some of the burden placed on Georgia cities, counties, state agencies, the courts, and the Department of Corrections, this chapter is enacted.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c12s42-12-2ol12">
       Before filing any sort of civil action, all citizens must evaluate the strengths of their claim in light of their own personal financial situation. Private individuals are forced to balance the strength of their case against the reality of court costs, filing fees, and the potential consequences of filing a frivolous or meritless lawsuit. Georgia's prisoners currently face no such dilemma. In light of the fact that all prisoners' needs are provided at city, county, or state expense, a prisoner cannot claim that his or her financial status or security would be compromised by a requirement to pay court costs and fees. To address this inequity, the General Assembly enacts this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c12s42-12-2ol13">
       In forma pauperis status will continue to allow the filing of an action by a prisoner, thus providing the prisoner with the constitutional right to access to courts. Freezing of the prisoner's inmate account will hold the prisoner responsible for court costs and fees by seizing any future deposits into the account.
