      The standards for lard, mixed edible fats, and cottonseed oils are defined as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t26c02s26-2-1ol11">
       "Lard" means the fat of freshly slaughtered swine. It shall not be made from a diseased animal or any portion of an animal unfit for food or contain less than 99 percent of pure fat.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c02s26-2-1ol12">
       "Mixed edible fat" means a mixture which contains not less than 99 percent of sweet mixed fat and may consist of a mixture of refined cottonseed oil or other edible vegetable oils with sweet beef fat or other edible animal fat and shall be sold under a registered or proprietary brand and properly labeled with a distinctive trademark or name bearing the name of the manufacturer.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c02s26-2-1ol13">
       "Edible cottonseed oil" means refined cottonseed oil, free from disagreeable taste or odors. White cottonseed oil for edible purposes is cottonseed oil which has been refined in such a manner as to be nearly colorless, flavorless, and odorless. Winter cottonseed oils for edible purposes are those from which a portion of the stearine has been removed; they may be either white or yellow.

     Purpose of O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2,
    
    Article 2. - O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2, the "Georgia Food Act," is a consumer protection Act, designed not to render the workplace a safe environment, but to prevent the sale and distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods to consumers. While safety in the workplace and compensation for injuries arising out of work activities are indeed matters of contemporary concern, they are the subject of other legislative enactments on both the state and federal level. Potts v. Fidelity Fruit &amp; Produce Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 546</cite>, <cite class="app_court">301 S.E.2d 903</cite> (1983).

      Determining if violation is negligence per se.

    <p>
     <p>
    - In determining whether the violation of a statute or ordinance, such as O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2, is negligence per se as to a particular person, it is necessary to examine the purposes of the legislation and decide: (1) whether the injured person falls within the class of persons the statute was intended to protect; and (2) whether the harm complained of was the harm the statute was intended to guard against. Potts v. Fidelity Fruit &amp; Produce Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 546</cite>, <cite class="app_court">301 S.E.2d 903</cite> (1983).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Injuries sustained other than in consumption of food not actionable under O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2,
    
    Article 2. - When the plaintiff brought an action to recover for personal injuries which the plaintiff allegedly sustained when bitten by a spider while unloading bananas from a truck and the incident occurred during the course of the plaintiff's employment because the alleged injuries did not arise incident to the plaintiff's consumption of the bananas, the trial court was correct in concluding that O.C.G.A. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2 affords the plaintiff no basis for recovery. Potts v. Fidelity Fruit &amp; Produce Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga.

It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or dispose of such detained or embargoed article by sale or otherwise without permission of the Commissioner.

      Meat and meat food products are an important source of the nation's total supply of food. It is essential to the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat food products are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged meat and meat food products, and result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat food products as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that regulation by the Commissioner and cooperation by this state and the United States as contemplated by this article are appropriate to the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise effectuate the purposes of this article.

      The Commissioner, in order to enforce this article or any orders, rules, and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, may issue an administrative order imposing a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 for each violation whenever the Commissioner, after a hearing, determines that any person has violated this article or any regulations or orders promulgated under this article.

Any person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available and who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any final order or action of the Commissioner shall have the right of judicial review thereof in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." All penalties recovered as provided for in this article shall be paid into the state treasury. The Commissioner may file in the superior court of the county where the person under order resides or, if said person is a corporation, in the county wherein the corporation maintains its principal place of business or in the county wherein the violation occurred a certified copy of a final order of the Commissioner unappealed from, or of a final order of the Commissioner affirmed upon appeal, whereupon said court shall render judgment in accordance therewith and notify the parties. Such judgment shall have the same effect, and all proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same, as though said judgment has been rendered in an action duly heard and determined by said court. The penalty prescribed in this Code section shall be concurrent, alternative, and cumulative with any and all other civil, criminal, or alternative rights, remedies, forfeitures, or penalties provided, allowed, or available to the Commissioner with respect to any violation of this article and any orders, rules, or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.

     <p>
      The General Assembly declares that purchasers and consumers have a right to expect and demand honesty and fair practices in the sale of meat for human consumption. It is the purpose of this Code section and Code Sections 26-2-151 through 26-2-154 to ensure that honest, fair, and ethical practices are followed in the advertising and sale of meat for human consumption and to authorize the Commissioner of Agriculture to take all actions necessary to ensure that such practices are followed. The General Assembly views with alarm the fact that misleading and false advertising and sales tactics have been used in the sale of meat to Georgia consumers. It is to stop these practices that the General Assembly has enacted this Code section and Code Sections 26-2-151 through 26-2-154. The consumer has a right to know what he is buying and the true cost of the meat which he is purchasing for consumption.

     <p>
      In determining the value of milk, cream, or other dairy products by the use of the Babcock test, it shall be unlawful to give any false reading or in any way manipulate the test so as to give a higher or lower percent of butterfat than the milk, cream, or other dairy products actually contain, or to cause any inaccuracy in reading the percent of butterfat by securing from any quantity of milk, cream, or other dairy products to be tested an inaccurate sample for the test. None other than the Babcock method, or such method of testing as may be approved by the Commissioner, may be employed when testing milk or cream, the test of which is to be used as a basis for making payment for the milk or cream thus tested. None other than the torsion balanced scales, or such scales as may be approved by the Commissioner, may be used when weighing cream for testing, when the tests are to be used as a basis for making payment for cream. It shall be unlawful to use adjustable scale weights in determining the weight of cream used in the Babcock test. Only such centrifuge shall be used as shall meet the approval of the Commissioner. Specifications for apparatus and chemicals and directions for testing milk and cream must conform to Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products, with such additions as shall be deemed advisable by the Commissioner to make them conform to this article. All test tubes, bottles, pipettes, burettes, or instruments used in connection with testing or determining the value of milk, cream, or other dairy products by the use of the Babcock test must be United States government standard and shall be approved by the Commissioner. All milk and cream tests shall be maintained at a temperature of 135 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three minutes before the reading of the percent of butterfat shall be made and recorded. In reading cream tests, glymol or its equivalent must be used, and the samples under test must be held for three minutes in a water bath extending up as high on the graduated neck as the sample itself does.

The Commissioner is authorized to apply for, and for cause shown the superior court having jurisdiction of the defendant in any such action may grant, injunctive relief, by interlocutory injunction, permanent injunction, or temporary restraining order, as the circumstances may warrant. The proceeding may be maintained notwithstanding the pendency of any civil action and notwithstanding the pendency of or conviction in a criminal proceeding arising from the same transaction. Such action may be maintained without bond. The purpose of this Code section is to create a statutory cause of action by way of injunction, and the Commissioner is authorized to bring such proceedings in the same form and manner and in the same court as other equitable proceedings may be brought. This remedy is not exclusive but is cumulative of other remedies afforded to protect the consuming public from unwholesome products which are economic frauds.

      <p>
       "(2) There is a growing concern as to the numbers and concentration of narcotic treatment programs located in certain parts of this state and that concentration of such narcotic treatment programs is in cities along Georgia's borders with neighboring states;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) There are reported and documented increases in heroin addiction and overdoses throughout this state;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) There is a grave concern over the public's well-being concerning the potential abuses of methadone and its relationship to geographic proximity, the population being served, and whether patients are receiving adequate treatment;
