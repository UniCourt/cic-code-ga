        In an equitable proceeding, it is the general rule

     <p>
      Generally, equity jurisprudence embraces the same matters of jurisdiction and modes of remedy as were allowed and practiced in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      (Orig. Code 1863, § 3033; Code 1868, § 3045; Code 1873, § 3100; Code 1882, § 3100; Civil Code 1895, § 3945; Civil Code 1910, § 4542; Code 1933, § 37-124.)

       <p>

       In England, as well as in most of the states, the rule that equity acts upon the person of the defendant is held to prevail, in the absence of statutory modification;

      Equity jurisdiction is established and allowed for the protection and relief of parties where, from any peculiar circumstances, the operation of the general rules of law would be deficient in protecting from anticipated wrong or relieving for injuries done.

       The universal test of the jurisdiction of a court to issue injunctions
      
      is the absence of a legal remedy by which the complainant might obtain the full relief to which the facts and circumstances entitle him, and this is likewise the test of its power to restrain breaches of a contract. Ford v. Finney, <cite class="ga_court">35 Ga. 258</cite> (1866); Chadwick v. Dolinoff, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 76</cite> (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Equity will grant relief only where there is no available and adequate and complete remedy at law.
      
      Colston v. Hutchinson, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 559</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 763</cite> (1951); Cantrell v. Henry County, <cite class="ga_court">250 Ga. 822</cite>, <cite class="app_court">301 S.E.2d 870</cite> (1983).
      </p>

      In a breach of contract action between an insurer and an agency, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in granting an interlocutory injunction to the agency as, after a balancing of the equities in the agency's favor, the record supported the finding that the insurer conducted itself, to the agency's detriment, as though arbitration of the dispute had been completed and it had been absolved from complying with its post-termination obligations under the underlying agency agreement between the parties. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stephen Brown Ins. Agency, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">660 S.E.2d 445</cite> (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1321, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 687 (Ga. 2008).

       Where all relief sought can be obtained in the manner provided for by law, it is error for equity to intervene.
      
      Waller v. Conner, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 633</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 845</cite> (1963); Thomason v. Harper Motor Lines, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 147</cite> (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Equity by writ of injunction will restrain any act which is illegal or contrary to equity and good conscience and for which no adequate remedy at law is provided. But where all the relief sought can be obtained in the manner provided by law, a suit in equity for injunction will not lie. Lanier v. Suttles, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 154</cite>, <cite class="app_court">91 S.E.2d 21</cite> (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Injunction does not lie where the complaining party has a plain and adequate remedy at law which is practical and efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as the remedy in equity. Thomason v. Harper Motor Lines, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 147</cite> (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Since equity jurisdiction is for the relief of parties where the general rules of law would be deficient in protecting from anticipated wrong or affording relief for injuries done, there is no sound reason in law or equity why equity should not take jurisdiction and grant relief from a void marriage complained of that will be both adequate and complete. Gearllach v. Odom, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 350</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 184</cite> (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where no legal reason appears from the allegations of the petition why the plaintiff, without seeking an injunction, is not possessed of an adequate and complete remedy at law; in the absence of such indispensable averments, the petition fails to state a proper cause for the extraordinary equitable remedy of injunction. Chadwick v. Dolinoff, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 76</cite> (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Equitable relief is inappropriate where an adequate and complete remedy at law in the form of an action in implied assumpsit or quasi-contract was and is available against a party, the record and the order of the trial court suggest that a money judgment against the party would provide complete relief with respect to him, and the record fails to disclose affirmatively that such a remedy would not be adequate. Cantrell v. Henry County, <cite class="ga_court">250 Ga. 822</cite>, <cite class="app_court">301 S.E.2d 870</cite> (1983).
      </p>

       When a statutory remedy by appeal has failed to eliminate the law violation or gross abuse of discretion which is its equivalent, equity will grant relief.
      
      Carter v. Board of Educ., <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E.2d 315</cite> (1966).

      Where, upon the death of the grantee in a deed executed by a married woman, a receiver is appointed for the property belonging to his estate, and the grantor in such a deed intervenes in the equitable proceeding for the purpose of asserting her right to recover the property so conveyed to the decedent, and mesne profits thereon, upon the ground that the conveyance was made in satisfaction of the debt of her husband, the proceeding is one in equity and is governed by equitable principles. In such a case the intervenor cannot recover against the assets in the hands of the receiver for administration in equity, without accounting for such portion of the consideration for her deed as was represented by her own obligation. Turner v. Warren, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 455</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 865</cite> (1942).
      </p>

       Courts exercising equitable jurisdiction will not enjoin prosecutions under municipal ordinances,
      
      even where the ordinances are allegedly invalid and there are threats of arrest and multiplicity of prosecutions, unless it is shown that the threatened prosecutions are for the sole purpose of unlawfully taking or destroying property or the business of the plaintiff, or that they will in fact result in irreparable injury thereto, and unless the complaining party has no plain and adequate remedy at law which is as practical and efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as its remedy in equity. Arnold v. Mathews, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 809</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E.2d 691</cite> (1970).

       <p>
      Statement that decisions of the boards of education will not be interfered with by courts of equity unless they amount to a violation of law or are a gross abuse of discretion must be read and considered along with the rule of law that remedies at law, if adequate, must be exhausted before resort to equity will be allowed; when thus construed they mean simply that, when the remedy by appeal has failed to eliminate the law violation or gross abuse of discretion which is its equivalent, equity will grant relief or, as is permissible in all cases to prevent irreparable injury, or where equity alone can grant adequate relief, exhaustion of the statutory remedy of appeal is not a prerequisite to relief in equity. Bedingfield v. Parkerson, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 654</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E.2d 714</cite> (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where it is necessary to prevent irreparable injury or where equity alone can grant adequate relief, exhaustion of a statutory remedy of appeal is not a prerequisite to relief in equity. Carter v. Board of Educ., <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E.2d 315</cite> (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       A court of equity should not exercise its extraordinary powers where there is no grave danger of impending injury;
      
      bare fears of injury will not authorize such action. McPhaul v. Simon, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 260</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 19</cite> (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The fact that repeated arrests and prosecutions may be instituted under an invalid ordinance will not, without more, justify equitable interference.
      
      Jewel Tea Co. v. City of Cartersville, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 799</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 712</cite> (1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The fact that a prosecution may be based on an invalid ordinance does not, in the absence of other circumstances, justify intervention of equity changing the general rule. Spur Distrib. Co. v. Mayor of Americus, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 842</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 30</cite> (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Mere inconvenience and expense and apprehension of injury to property rights will not give equity jurisdiction;
      
      neither will mere general allegations of irreparable injury and deprivation of property rights. Spur Distrib. Co. v. Mayor of Americus, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 842</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 30</cite> (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Mere financial inability to furnish the bond required affords no lawful basis for equitable interference.
      
      Grimmett v. Barnwell, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 191</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       As a general rule, equity will not decree specific performance of contracts relating to personal property.
      
      Black v. American Vending Co., <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 420</cite> (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Only under exceptional facts and circumstances may equity powers be used to restrain criminal prosecutions,
      
      even though their defense may be burdensome and attended by inconvenience. Spur Distrib. Co. v. Mayor of Americus, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 842</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 30</cite> (1940).
      </p>

       Where a petitioner seeking an equitable decree annulling a bigamous marriage
      
      asserts that he did not know at the time of the ceremony that the defendant was a married woman; he does not come into court with unclean hands barring him from equitable relief. Gearllach v. Odom, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 350</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 184</cite> (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Although it is uncertain that there can be a successfully-maintained proceeding in equity to annul a marriage that, as a matter of law, is null and void already,
      
      the designation of the petition as one for annulment is no reason why a decree as prayed, declaring the marriage void, should not be granted, since such a decree is essential to the full protection of the petitioner from injury that is and well may be anticipated as a result of a void marriage ceremony. Gearllach v. Odom, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 350</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 184</cite> (1946).

      Equity will not take cognizance of a plain legal right where an adequate and complete remedy is provided by law; but the mere privilege of a party to bring an action at law or the existence of a common-law remedy not as complete or effectual as the equitable relief shall not deprive equity of jurisdiction.

       <p>

       It will be readily seen from this section that, if the law itself provides a full and adequate remedy,
      
      ordinarily that is the end of the matter, and equity will not interfere. Grimmett v. Barnwell, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 191</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Equity grants no relief to one who has an adequate remedy at law.
      
      Goodman v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 396</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E.2d 764</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Equity grants no relief to one who has an adequate and complete remedy at law for the redress of an actionable wrong. Mayor of Carrollton v. Chambers, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 193</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 755</cite> (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where an adequate remedy at law exists equity is without jurisdiction of the case. Y. v. S., <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E.2d 321</cite> (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A money judgment having been rendered in a trover suit pending bankruptcy proceedings voluntarily instituted by the defendant therein, the petition brought by him to enjoin garnishment proceedings based on the trover judgment on the ground that the debt had been subsequently discharged by the order of the bankruptcy court, should have been dismissed on general demurrer (now motion to dismiss); because, if the debt was discharged, he could have fully protected himself by setting up this defense in the court where the garnishment case was pending and where he had an adequate and complete remedy at law, in which event a court of equity will not grant relief; and because a judgment for plaintiff in an action of trover, although rendered for a sum of money and not for the property in controversy, constitutes an adjudication of the plaintiff's title to the property, and the debt thus created is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Nash Loan Co. v. Yonge, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 672</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 811</cite> (1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Insolvency of a subcontractor and inability to respond to such damages as the contractor might recover for breach of the contract is ground for equitable intervention. By bringing in the surety whose principal was insolvent the contractor would be able to obtain full relief, but the contractor's legal remedy would not be complete or as effective and efficient to the ends of justice as that which could be afforded by a court of equity. Concrete Coring Contractors v. Mechanical Contractors &amp; Eng'rs, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 714</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 439</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Since the plaintiff had an adequate and complete remedy at law by affidavit of illegality, an affidavit of illegality, and not a petition for injunction, was the procedure which the plaintiff should have employed to test the validity of property tax assessments. Mayor of Carrollton v. Chambers, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 193</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 755</cite> (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In the absence of statutory authority, equity will not intervene where a party has a complete and adequate remedy at law and no other equitable reasons, such as avoidance of a multiplicity of suits or that the acts of the defendant complained of constitute a constantly recurring wrong, generally denominated a continuing wrong, are alleged. Womble v. State Bd. of Exmrs., <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 457</cite>, <cite class="app_court">145 S.E.2d 485</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where the petitioner sought to have an ordinance declared void, and the prosecutions enjoined, and by an amendment to the charter disputed tax executions may be contested by affidavit of illegality, this adequate and complete remedy at law to contest the validity of the ordinance being available, the intervention of equity would not be authorized. City of Eatonton v. Peck, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 705</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 61</cite> (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      If for any special reason the remedy by attachment against a nonresident debtor in an ordinary claim ex contractu or ex delicto is unavailable or inadequate, equity will lend its aid; but, where in such an ordinary claim the remedy by attachment is available and affords adequate relief, and where, the facts alleged fail to invoke any other recognized principle authorizing equitable relief, a court of equity will refuse to assume jurisdiction. Grimmett v. Barnwell, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 191</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Petition to have defendant enjoined from interfering with plaintiffs in possession of disputed part of land, possession and control of which was alleged to be in defendant, showed no ground for equitable relief, and the existence of an adequate remedy at law because a court of equity will not ordinarily entertain a bill solely for the purpose of establishing the title of a party to real estate, or for the recovery of possession thereof, as these objects can generally be accomplished by an action of ejectment at law. Slaughter v. Land, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 491</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 754</cite> (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A mere privilege to a party to sue at law, or the existence of a common-law remedy not as complete or effectual as the equitable relief, does not deprive equity of jurisdiction. Quitman Cooperage Co. v. People's First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 17</cite> (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A bare threat of injury to property, which, if followed up by an overt act would work irreparable injury, affords no basis for equitable relief by injunction or otherwise. Nottingham v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 481</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 93</cite> (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where a defendant has been served and a judgment is rendered against him by fraud, accident, or mistake, without fault or negligence on his part, a petition in equity to set aside the judgment will lie. Dollar v. Fred W. Amend Co., <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E.2d 696</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where private property is actually about to be confiscated by the enforcement of an assessment for a local improvement, the remedy of affidavit of illegality as provided in the city charter is not as complete or effectual as equitable relief; in such a case an injunction may be granted. Holst v. City of La Grange, <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 402</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 217</cite> (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where the plaintiff contends all partnership relations between the plaintiff and the defendant have come to an end, that a balance has been struck, and that an indebtedness is allegedly due by the defendant to the plaintiff, which cannot be affected by any transactions between the partnership and its creditors or debtors, this is not an equitable action by a member of a firm against his copartner, but an action of law, one man against another who has formerly been his partner, upon an indebtedness a part of which grew out of the formerly existing partnership between them. Manry v. Hendricks, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E.2d 434</cite> (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where the partnership has been fully dissolved by written contract and the rights of each party definitely established, in case of a breach of such contract equity will not order an accounting, as the remedy is at law. Manry v. Hendricks, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E.2d 434</cite> (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Even if in any case equity can remove an executor, where there were no allegations in petition seeking inter alia removal of an executor for fraud and conspiracy tending to show why complainants could not by pursuing the remedy provided by law before the court of ordinary (now probate court) as pointed out in
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.53.html#t53c07s53-7-32" target="_blank">53-7-32</a></cite>, obtain relief as complete and effectual as in a court of equity, under the principle codified in this section, equity would not assume jurisdiction. Georgia Baptist Orphans Home v. Weaver, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 669</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 272</cite> (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where plaintiff alleges that he provided certain labor and materials used in the construction of an apartment house under a contract with subcontractor of general contractor, for which he has not been paid, and alleges no reason why his remedy at law, suit on the contract, would not be adequate, full, and complete, nor does he allege that subcontractor is insolvent or unable in any way to respond in damages, or is a nonresident of the state, trial court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Maggi v. Sylvan Circle Apts., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 580</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 368</cite> (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Equitable relief is improper if the complainant has a remedy at law which is "adequate," i.e., as practical and as efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as the remedy in equity. Sherrer v. Hale, <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 793</cite>, <cite class="app_court">285 S.E.2d 714</cite> (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Equity will grant relief only where there is no available adequate and complete remedy at law. Cantrell v. Henry County, <cite class="ga_court">250 Ga. 822</cite>, <cite class="app_court">301 S.E.2d 870</cite> (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Equitable relief is inappropriate where an adequate and complete remedy at law in the form of an action in implied assumpsit or quasi-contract was and is available against a party, the record and the order of the trial court suggest that a money judgment against the party would provide complete relief with respect to him, and the record fails to disclose affirmatively that such a remedy would not be adequate. Cantrell v. Henry County, <cite class="ga_court">250 Ga. 822</cite>, <cite class="app_court">301 S.E.2d 870</cite> (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where subsequent to the court's order of payment of a sum of money into the court registry, the jury awarded a judgment in that amount to plaintiff, as plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, the equitable relief granted by the trial court was inappropriate. Prosser v. Hancock Bus Sales, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">349 S.E.2d 460</cite> (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In a breach of contract action between an insurer and an agency, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in granting an interlocutory injunction to the agency as, after a balancing of the equities in the agency's favor, the record supported the finding that the insurer conducted itself, to the agency's detriment, as though arbitration of the dispute had been completed and it had been absolved from complying with its post-termination obligations under the underlying agency agreement between the parties. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stephen Brown Ins. Agency, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">660 S.E.2d 445</cite> (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1321, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 687 (Ga. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Injunction requiring a bank to pay certain funds into a trial court's registry was inappropriate because a lender had an adequate remedy at law since it could obtain a judgment to completely compensate it for any loss from the bank's removal of funds from a debtor's account. Century Bank of Ga. v. Bank of Am., N.A., <cite class="ga_court">286 Ga. 72</cite>, <cite class="app_court">685 S.E.2d 82</cite> (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      An employer whose employee had opened a competing business and taken the employer's trade secrets and confidential information had an adequate and complete remedy at law because it could recover money damages from the employee if the employee removed funds from the employee's competing business that rightfully belonged to the employer. Therefore, under O.C.G.A.

Coleman v. Retina Consultants, P.C., <cite class="ga_court">286 Ga. 317</cite>, <cite class="app_court">687 S.E.2d 457</cite> (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Mere apprehension of danger, unless founded upon reason, will not require equitable relief.
      
      Maggi v. Sylvan Circle Apts., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 580</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 368</cite> (1951).

         A remedy at law, to exclude appropriate relief in equity, must be complete and the substantial equivalent of the equitable relief.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - It is not enough that there is a remedy at law. It must be plain and adequate, or, in other words, as practical and as efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as the remedy in equity. Davis v. Logan, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 524</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 568</cite> (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a case arising from a mortgage fraud scheme, the government unsuccessfully argued that a title insurance company was not entitled to a constructive trust because it had an adequate remedy at law based on the Attorney General's authority, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.
   §
   853(i)(1), to remit a forfeiture in the interest of justice. Not only was the
   §
   853(i)(1) remission a non-judicial remedy left entirely to the discretion of the Attorney General, but under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c01s23-1-4" target="_self">23-1-4</a></cite>, equitable remedies, such as constructive trusts, were not precluded by the existence of an alternate remedy that was not as complete or effectual as the equitable relief. United States v. Shefton, 548 F.3d 1360 (11th Cir. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An unconstitutional or void statutory provision will not furnish an adequate remedy at law.
       
       Stinson v. Manning, <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 487</cite>, <cite class="app_court">145 S.E.2d 541</cite> (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where it is necessary to prevent irreparable injury or where equity alone can grant adequate relief,
       
       exhaustion of a statutory remedy of appeal is not a prerequisite to relief in equity. Carter v. Board of Educ., <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E.2d 315</cite> (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When a statutory remedy by appeal has failed to eliminate the law violation or gross abuse of discretion which is its equivalent, equity will grant relief.
       
       Carter v. Board of Educ., <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E.2d 315</cite> (1966).
       </p>

        <p>

        Property owners dissatisfied with the act of a building inspector in issuing a permit to erect a church have the right to appeal
       
       from the order of the building inspector to the board of adjustment. Ledbetter v. Callaway, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 607</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E.2d 317</cite> (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        As a general rule, equity will not decree specific performance of contracts relating to personal property.
       
       Black v. American Vending Co., <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 420</cite> (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A court of equity will not ordinarily entertain a bill solely for the purpose of establishing title of a party to real estate,
       
       or for the recovery of possession thereof, as these objects can generally be accomplished by an action of ejectment of law. Collier v. Garner, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 467</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 353</cite> (1933); Nottingham v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 481</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 93</cite> (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Except in a case specially provided for by statute, equity will not interfere to restrain a trespass,
       
       unless the injury is irreparable in damages, or the trespasser is insolvent, or there exist other circumstances which, in the discretion of the court, render the interposition of this writ necessary and proper. Collier v. Garner, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 467</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 353</cite> (1933); Nottingham v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 481</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 93</cite> (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where a petition does not allege facts showing irreparable damages nor any trespass by the defendant upon any lands claimed by the petitioner, nor that the defendant is insolvent, and does not show why a court of equity should take jurisdiction in order to avoid multiplicity of action, the petition failed to state a cause of action for any equitable relief. Shobkov v. Pennington, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 315</cite>, <cite class="app_court">122 S.E.2d 87</cite> (1961).

       A court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the judge of probate court over the settlement of accounts of administrators and executors;
      
      and the court first taking jurisdiction will retain it. Terry v. Chandler, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E. 572</cite> (1931).

       <p>
      While the ordinary (now judge of probate court) and the judge of the superior court have equal and concurrent jurisdiction in a habeas corpus proceeding between husband and wife involving the custody of their child, it is the general rule that, where two courts have such concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties, the court first taking jurisdiction will retain it unless some good reason be shown for equitable interference. Breeden v. Breeden, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 740</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 667</cite> (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      While the ordinary (now judge of probate court) and the judge of the superior court have equal and concurrent jurisdiction in determining the custody of the children of husband and wife living in a state of separation, only the superior court, so far as habeas corpus proceedings may be resorted to, has jurisdiction of such subject matter when related to a suit for divorce, and superior court judge who, after a habeas corpus proceeding before the ordinary (now judge of probate court) acquires jurisdiction of the subject matter in a divorce proceeding, may properly enjoin further progress of the former proceeding before the ordinary (now judge of probate court), in order that all questions raised by the divorce suit may be considered together. Ponder v. Ponder, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 781</cite>, <cite class="app_court">32 S.E.2d 801</cite> (1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Since equity has concurrent jurisdiction with courts of ordinary (now probate courts) in the administration of estates, where its interference is necessary for the full protection of the rights of parties at interest and since it is a recognized rule that, where the heirs at law get together and agree to divide the estate and appoint an agent and put him in possession of the property for that purpose, a bill may be filed against him by any one or more of the distributees, the same as against an administrator, it cannot be said that, a petition seeking an order restraining the heir's agent from the alleged fraudulent acts, and a receivership under direction of the court of equity was devoid of equity. Shingler v. Shingler, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 824</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where the superior court acquired jurisdiction of the question of the custody of a child in a divorce case, it retained that jurisdiction for the purpose of rendering a final judgment as to the custody of the child, and where the attempted dismissal by the wife of the proceeding was ineffectual, the ordinary (now judge of probate court) of the county, to whom the wife presented a petition for the writ of habeas corpus, was without jurisdiction to act upon the petition. Breeden v. Breeden, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 740</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 667</cite> (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where a habeas corpus proceeding is filed in the court of ordinary (now probate court), involving custody of a minor child, and subsequently a petition is filed involving divorce, alimony, and the custody of such child, equity has power to enjoin the habeas corpus proceeding and determine all the issues in one action. Duke v. Duke, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 21</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 161</cite> (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Where the court has acquired equitable jurisdiction of the parties and the cause by virtue of equitable averments and prayers,
      
      it retains jurisdiction for all related purposes as made by the pleadings. Kniepkamp v. Richards, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 509</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1941).

      Where it appears from a petition praying for an accounting that there was pending in another court a suit by the corporate defendant against the plaintiff, such court being empowered to render an accounting between the parties, and no special reason being set out why a court of equity should assume jurisdiction for such purpose, equity will not enjoin the proceedings and processes of a court of law in the absence of some intervening equity or other proper defense of which the party, without fault on his part, cannot avail himself at law. Peeples v. Peeples, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 358</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 629</cite> (1942).

      Equity is ancillary, not antagonistic, to the law; hence, equity follows the law where the rule of law is applicable and follows the analogy of the law where no rule is directly applicable.

       While equity follows the law as to limitations of actions,
      
      neither laches nor the statute of limitations will run against one in peaceable possession of property under a claim of ownership for delay in resorting to the courts to establish his rights. Crow v. Whitfield, <cite class="ga_app_court">105 Ga. App. 436</cite>, <cite class="app_court">124 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1962).

      A judge could not refuse to grant an injunction to which a party was entitled under the law, unless that party would agree to waive the incompetency declared by statute of a witness as to the particular testimony sought to be delivered by him, as equity is not antagonistic to the law, but follows the law. Ferrell v. Wight, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 360</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 271</cite> (1938).

      A court of equity will not set aside a judgment, although obtained by willful and corrupt perjury, unless it appears that the perjurer has been convicted of such perjury, and unless it appears that a judgment could not have been rendered without the perjured testimony. Hutchings v. Roquemore, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 359</cite>, <cite class="app_court">155 S.E. 675</cite> (1930).

      Where an unmarried man procures a life insurance policy on his own life in which his mother is named beneficiary, and the policy gives the insured the right to change the beneficiary at any time, and subsequently as a consideration for marriage he agrees to substitute his wife as beneficiary in the insurance policy and tells his wife that he has made the change, but later dies without ever having attempted to have the beneficiary changed, the mother is vested with title to the proceeds of the policy upon the death of the insured, and nothing that the insurer can do thereafter can destroy or impair the mother's title thereto; and a court of equity is required, in a contest between the mother and the wife, to award the proceeds of the insurance policy to the mother.

      In a contract suit against a nonresident of Georgia who could not be served personally, praying for a temporary receiver to take charge of certain securities and hold them subject to the order of the court and for other relief where legal attachment was impossible and a court of equity intervened, the court was authorized to require a bond of the plaintiff, similar to an attachment bond.

      Between a debtor and his judgment creditor the controlling equity lies in favor of the creditor to have satisfaction of his judgment and a court of equity will rarely, if ever, interfere with the creditor in his use of the legal means afforded him for the collection of his debt.

      Since equity follows the analogy of the law, when fraud is charged, the period of limitations applicable to an action for fraud is the same as that which would apply to an action for the land, that is seven years from the discovery of the fraud. Slade v. Barber, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 405</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1946).

       Equity will not give relief when to do so would violate express provisions of a statute.

       <p>

       Power to levy and collect taxes is exclusively a legislative function,
      
      and unless authorized by statute, a court of equity is without power to foreclose a lien for taxes and order a sale of the property; no such power having been conferred by statute on a court of equity in this state, the court erred in decreeing that land be sold by the sheriff for payment of state and county taxes. Kirk v. Bray, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 814</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 733</cite> (1935).

       Rule that equity seeks always to do complete justice will not bring into equitable jurisdiction matters over which another court has exclusive jurisdiction.

      Where judge has exercised jurisdiction on the question of the sale of the property of wards for reinvestment in United States bonds, he has the right to retain jurisdiction for the purpose of passing upon the claim of the intervenor to a just and reasonable commission for producing the buyer of the property, thus rendering full and complete relief to all parties to the cause.

       Equity seeks to do full justice but must do so within the parameters of the law;
      
      therefore, a temporary restraining order that acknowledged that students had no legal right to participate in graduation ceremony but ordered that they be allowed to do so anyway, so as to "do the right thing," was in error. Dolinger v. Driver, <cite class="ga_court">269 Ga. 141</cite>, <cite class="app_court">498 S.E.2d 252</cite> (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       It is one of the maxims of equity that it will not do justice by halves,
      
      and what constitutes its chief value is that it can bring before it all parties engaged in a transaction, and however diversified their interests and liabilities may be, it can frame a decree giving each complainant his right, and holding each defendant to his proper accountability. Matson v. Crowe, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 578</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 288</cite> (1942).
      </p>

       <p>

       When court has acquired equitable jurisdiction, it will grant complete relief as to all matters to which parties may be entitled
      
      under the pleadings and the proof, even though such relief may include legal rights and remedies. Latham v. Fowler, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 686</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 591</cite> (1941).
      </p>
      <p>

      Where equity acquires jurisdiction for any purpose, it will retain jurisdiction to give full and complete relief, whether legal or equitable, as to all purposes relating to the subject matter. Kirk v. Hasty, <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 362</cite>, <cite class="app_court">236 S.E.2d 667</cite> (1977); Early v.

      To preserve a trust estate, to supervise its management, to hold the trustee to the line of duty, for the purpose of preserving its corpus for the benefit of the beneficiaries, is an elementary branch of equity jurisprudence. The judge of the superior court of each county has power, either in term or at chambers, to remove and appoint trustees. When a court of equity obtains jurisdiction for one purpose, it will proceed to give full relief to all parties with reference to the subject matter of the suit, where it has jurisdiction for that purpose. Fine v. Saul, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 309</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 439</cite> (1936).

      Suits in equity shall be tried in the county where a defendant resides against whom substantial relief is prayed; and he who would have equity must do equity. Hence equity, having the parties before the court rightfully, will proceed to give full relief to all parties in reference to the subject matter provided the court has jurisdiction thereof. Pearson v. George, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 18</cite>, <cite class="app_court">83 S.E.2d 593</cite> (1954).

      Since equity has concurrent jurisdiction with courts of ordinary (now probate courts) in the administration of estates, where its interference is necessary for the full protection of the rights of parties at interest and since it is a recognized rule that, where the heirs at law get together and agree to divide the estate and appoint an agent and put him in possession of the property for that purpose, a bill may be filed against him by any one or more of the distributees, the same as against an administrator, it cannot be said that a petition seeking an order restraining the heir's agent from the alleged fraudulent acts and a receivership under direction of the court of equity was devoid of equity. Shingler v. Shingler, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 824</cite> (1937).

      In an action in equity, brought against the sole heir at law of a deceased person, to reform a deed executed by a decedent and to recover possession and damages in the nature of mesne profits from a tenant of the heir at law in possession of the property, and to cancel security deeds executed by the heir at law in favor of third persons, the element of the need for reformation of the deed constitutes a common nexus in which all the parties are interested, authorizing the joinder of all interested parties; and since the other relief, both legal and equitable, prayed against the other parties respectively, for recovery of possession and damages for mesne profits and for cancellation of the security deeds, is merely such relief as is needful to make complete the justice to be done by reforming the deed, the action is not multifarious. Mims v. Lifsey, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 366</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E.2d 440</cite> (1941).

      Where the holder of a deed from a deceased person brings an action in equity against the sole heir at law of the decedent, there being no administration of the decedent's estate, to reform the deed so as to make the description in the deed include lands held adversely by the heir at law and his tenant for years, it is proper to join also as defendants persons to whom the heir at law has executed deeds to secure debt. It is proper in an action to reform an instrument to join as defendants all who are interested adversely to the reformation. Mims v. Lifsey, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 366</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E.2d 440</cite> (1941).

      Where court has jurisdiction for the purpose of giving injunctive relief against a nuisance, it could under the well-established law of this state retain it as to damages in order to do complete justice between the parties, and upon proper determination of the damages caused by each of the defendants could render judgment against them for their proportionate parts of the damage done. Vaughn v. Burnette, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 206</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 568</cite> (1954).

      Where the complainants under their allegations were entitled in equity to an accounting, and the amount which by the accounting they sought to establish was due them, if at all, as remainder legatees under their mother's will, the right of the executor to sell the property, the right of the petitioners to have a partition, and their right to a judgment against the defendant personally all related to the same thing, to wit, the management by the defendant as trustee and executrix of property disposed of by their mother in her will, and a court of equity would in the same suit undertake to settle the other controversies growing out of the same subject matter, and grant the other relief indicated in the prayers relating to injunction and partition, although these, standing alone, could not be granted. Matson v. Crowe, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 578</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 288</cite> (1942).

      An equity court, by the continuing receivership, has jurisdiction to make a final disposition of the property according to the respective interests of the parties, and to this end can order a division by sale if necessary.

       As general rule court of equity will not intervene to enjoin collection of tax
      
      where no execution has been issued and levied on any of the property of the taxpayer, even though the taxing authorities may have demanded of him that he pay the tax. Warren v. Suttles, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 311</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 172</cite> (1940).

      Where plaintiff's petition for injunction against tax collector's interference with a boxing exhibition and collection of tax alleged that he had been notified by the tax collector that he would not permit him to stage his boxing bout if the tax was not paid, that the tax collector would carry out his threat if not enjoined, and that such conduct would cause him irreparable injury and damage, equity had jurisdiction and authority to grant an injunction under the facts when the petition was presented and sanctioned, and fact that at the time of the hearing part of the relief sought, enjoining the tax collector from closing the plaintiff's boxing exhibition, was no longer appropriate for consideration since the exhibition had been held under the protection of a temporary restraining order should not have prevented the court from retaining jurisdiction of the case for the purpose of determining the legality of the alleged tax and granting a permanent injunction against its collection. Warren v. Suttles, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 311</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 172</cite> (1940).

        Equity treats as done that which in fairness ought to have been done.

      Since equity considers that done which ought to be done, it is therefore recognized that in order to prevent forfeitures, which are not favored, equity will lay hold upon any expressed intention of an insured to designate an eligible beneficiary, or any inchoate effort to designate a substituted beneficiary in lieu of a deceased one, where death or illness of the insured prevents the filling of such vacancy. Hewell v. Atlanta Police Relief Ass'n, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 828</cite> (1937).

      Since equity considers that done which ought to have been done, equity will decree that a child is entitled to the fruits of a legal adoption where the act of formal adoption had not been consummated. Toler v. Goodin, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 527</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1946).

      This section sets out the general principle on which a court of equity may, in a proper case, allow inheritance under the so-called doctrine of virtual adoption. Toler v. Goodin, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 527</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1946).

       <p>
      Where the plaintiffs are alleged to constitute the sole survivors of the class which could be designated as beneficiaries of the defendant relief association, and for whose benefit the certificate was taken out and maintained, equity in the exercise of its jurisdiction will account that done which ought to have been done if opportunity had been given, and in order to avoid a forfeiture will treat such children, the plaintiffs, as being in good conscience as much as the actual beneficiaries under the certificate as if the insured father had been afforded opportunity to name and had actually named them as such. Hewell v. Atlanta Police Relief Ass'n, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 828</cite> (1937).

      Despite the death of the party against whom relief is sought, equity will grant relief and decree that to be done which ought to have been done. Holsomback v. Caldwell, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">128 S.E.2d 47</cite> (1962).

      Where to a proceeding to foreclose a deed to secure debt as an equitable mortgage, which prays for judgment for principal, interest, and attorney's fees, a debtor files a plea in which it is alleged that the petitioner held as collateral fire insurance policies with a loss-payable clause in favor of the petitioner aggregating more than the amount of the debt, which had become due and payable as the result of a fire some months before there was a default on the debt, and that the insurance could have been collected at any time, but was not collected due solely to the negligence of the petitioner who had made no demand for payment, and that the attorney's fees sought in the foreclosure proceeding would have been unnecessary had such collection been made, such plea alleged facts sufficient to show a breach of duty, both in law and in equity, upon the part of the creditor, which would prevent it from collecting attorney's fees and deny the creditor any relief in equity. Irwin v. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 354</cite> (1948).

      Even though an appointment may have been made to an office where the term of the incumbent has not expired, and in pursuance of the order of appointment the incumbent has been forcibly removed from the room or quarters of his office and thereby deprived of the opportunity of exercising the duties of the office, such incumbent will in equity continue to be treated as the incumbent for the purpose of protecting him in his right to function as such official, pending a judicial determination of the validity of such appointment. Partain v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">227 Ga. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 450</cite> (1971).

       The court considers as actually having been performed acts which have been directed or which have agreed or intended to be done. Thus, an agreement to give security may, in a proper case, be deemed to have been executed by the giving of security. United States v. Ferguson, 409 F. Supp. 393 (S.D.

       In a case of virtual adoption the alleged agreement must be proved so clearly, strongly, and satisfactorily as to leave no reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. Toler v. Goodin, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 527</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1946).

       An authenticated copy of an application of the parent for a homestead which contained the following question and answer, "If married, of whom does your family consist?" "My wife and adopted daughter and myself," was relevant in an action to prove a virtual adoption as illustrating whether there had been a contract to adopt the child, since it indicates that the child was living with the parents at that time. Toler v. Goodin, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 527</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1946).

       A parol obligation of a person to adopt the child of another as his own, accompanied by a virtual though not a statutory adoption, and acted upon by all parties concerned for many years and during the obligor's life, may be enforced in equity upon the death of the obligor by decreeing the child entitled as a child to the property of the obligor, undisposed of by will. Toler v. Goodin, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 527</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 609</cite> (1946).

       An agreement by a married couple that if the natural parent would relinquish all claims of all nature to his child the couple would adopt the child as their own, would love her and provide for her fully all things essential to her welfare, and make her their heir to inherit at their death as if she had been their natural child, is sufficient to create a contract of adoption.

       - Specific performance was the proper remedy since there was no adequate remedy at law given the nature of the stock in the small, family-owned business, and the explicit acknowledgment in the shareholders' buy-sell agreement that specific performance was the appropriate remedy in the event of a breach. Moreover, given the failure of all parties to strictly follow the terms of either the agreement or Bylaws, an equitable remedy considered that done which ought to be done. Wallace v.

       - When the LLC granted the condominium association an easement to a perpetual non-exclusive right to access the LLC's private roadway system, there was no evidence of any inequitable conduct on the part of the LLC, which had consistently denied that the shuttle bus's passage through the gate during rush hour constituted a default under the easement, in an attempt to trap or deceive the association through the estoppel certificate; thus, the association did not show that there remained an issue of material fact as to the LLC's reasonable reliance on the estoppel certificate in the LLC's conveyance of real property to a third party.

        As a general rule, equity will not grant relief to a party who comes into court with unclean hands,
       
       or is guilty of an illegal or immoral act, nor aid a grantor or his administrator in seeking to cancel a security deed which was executed by him for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors; these rules stem from the just and salutary principle that one will not be permitted to profit by his own wrong, and apply where a party is seeking the aid of equity in the enforcement of executory contracts or its aid under an executed contract.

       The deliberate attempt to take another man's wife from him, and entering into an engagement with her to marry at a time when she could not lawfully marry, and giving a ring to further such an unlawful engagement is a defiance of public policy and constitutes the rankest sort of unclean hands.

       - In a post-divorce proceeding, a trial court did not err in refusing to hold a mother in contempt and by finding that the father came to court with unclean hands because the evidence showed that the mother did not obtain certain medical evaluations and treatments for the parties' children as previously ordered because the father had not paid child support, had not paid one-half of the medical expenses already incurred for the children, and the children's doctor refused to see the children anymore due to the father's belligerent conduct toward the doctor and staff, thus, the father did have unclean hands for failing to pay the expenses and by the conduct toward the doctor. Higdon v. Higdon, <cite class="ga_app_court">321 Ga. App. 260</cite>, <cite class="app_court">739 S.E.2d 498</cite> (2013).

        This principle is applicable where one in an equity suit seeks both legal and equitable relief.
       
       One who avails himself of an equitable remedy is as much bound by this principle as one who is asserting in such a court a purely equitable right. Wilder v.

       - Equitable doctrine of unclean hands had no application to an action at law, and, in a suit seeking to recover on three promissory notes, a trial court was not authorized to reduce the amounts shown to be due and payable on the notes on account of its finding of unclean hands.

        - Under Georgia law, the unclean hands doctrine does not attach to all prior bad acts. There must be a direct relationship between the equitable relief sought and the acts giving rise to the unclean hands. ABC Home Health Servs., Inc. v. IBM Corp., 158 F.R.D. 180 (S.D. Ga. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a diversity contract dispute any relationship between the destruction of personal files on computer and software developer's equitable claims concerning Medicare reimbursements was merely tangential and would not support dismissal of developer's equitable counterclaims on the basis of unclean hands.

        The rule that he who would have equity must do equity refers to equitable rights respecting the subject matter of the action;
       
       it does not embrace outside matters. Atlanta Ass'n of Fire Ins. Agents v. McDonald, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 105</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 822</cite> (1935).

       The unclean hands maxim applies to equitable rights which relate directly to the cause of action; it does not embrace matters outside the subject matter of the action. Adams v. Crowell, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 576</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 151</cite> (1981); Zappa v. Automotive Precision Mach., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">205 Ga.

        In an action for specific performance,
       
       although it was found that plaintiff's indebtedness had not been completely discharged, the clean hands doctrine did not apply because the court also found that plaintiff was unaware of the existence or amount of the arrearages until defendant testified about them at trial. Dobbs v. Dobbs, <cite class="ga_court">270 Ga. 887</cite>, <cite class="app_court">515 S.E.2d 384</cite> (1999).

        - A plaintiff with unclean hands who has proper standing may still bring an action to enforce the rights of others and secure relief on their behalf, even though doing so may result in an indirect benefit to the unclean plaintiff. West v. West, 825 F. Supp. 1033 (N.D. Ga. 1992).

        The unclean hands maxim which bars a complainant in equity from obtaining relief has reference to an inequity
       
       which inflects the cause of action so that to entertain it would be violative of conscience; it must relate directly to the transaction concerning which complaint is made. Atlanta Ass'n of Fire Ins. Agents v. McDonald, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 105</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 822</cite> (1935).

        The rule that equity refuses to interfere where both parties are at fault

        <p>

        An inequity that causes the invocation of the "clean hands" rule must relate directly to the transaction concerning which complaint is made.
       
       The rule refers to equitable rights respecting the subject matter of the action, and it does not embrace outside matters. Partain v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">227 Ga. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E.2d 450</cite> (1971).

        <p>
       Where a constitutional officer's previous act in complying with the Governor's demand for an undated resignation letter is unrelated to the relief sought in a judicial action seeking rightful possession of the constitutional office, no unclean hands are involved.

        Where husband deeded land to former wife in order to avoid any alimony claim
       
       against it by his second wife, doctrine of unclean hands barred husband's suit seeking to compel former wife to reconvey land to him on theory that she committed fraud on him in obtaining the deeds to the land.

       - Suits in equity shall be tried in the county where a defendant resides against whom substantial relief is prayed; and he who would have equity must do equity, hence equity, having the parties before the court rightfully, will proceed to give full relief to all parties in reference to the subject matter provided the court has jurisdiction thereof.

       Trial court properly granted the supplier summary judgment on the purchaser's wrongful foreclosure claim because it was undisputed that the purchaser accepted and failed to repay at least $6,000 of the loan proceeds and failed to tender any amount in connection with the purchaser's claim of wrongful foreclosure.

        Before equity will hearken unto a suitor's prayer for equitable relief, he must offer to do full and complete equity

       A party is not obliged to return that which he will be entitled to retain, as a condition to a cancellation; so, if a plaintiff has received no more than he was entitled to, his offer to account for the same in adjustment of the differences between the parties sufficiently meets the requirement that he who seeks equity must do equity. Smith v. Merck, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 361</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1950).

        Equity will not decree the cancellation of an instrument where anything of value has been received until repayment is either made or tendered,

       Pursuant to the basic principle of equity, in this section a borrower who has executed a deed to secure debt is not entitled to an injunction against a sale of the property under a power in the deed, unless he first pays or tenders to the creditor the amount admittedly due. This is true notwithstanding any allegation that the defendant has breached some independent covenant. Bower v. Certain-Teed Prod.

       Before a borrower who has executed to the same grantee two deeds to secure debts can have affirmative equitable relief to set aside a sale by the creditor under exercise of the power of sale contained in the deeds, and an injunction against the creditor and the persons claiming under him to prevent interference with the debtor's possession of a portion of the property, such debtor must pay or tender to the creditor the principal and interest which he admits to be due, and would not be relieved of this duty by reason of the fact that the creditor was demanding of him more than he owed. Harpe v. Stone, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 341</cite>, <cite class="app_court">92 S.E.2d 522</cite> (1956).

       Before one who has given a deed to secure his debt can have set aside in equity a sale by the creditor in exercise of the power conferred by the deed, and injunction to prevent interference with the debtor's possession of the property conveyed by the deed, he must pay or tender to the creditor the amount of principal and interest due.

       In order to enable plaintiffs to come into equity it is essential in the first instance that they should have paid or tendered the amount admitted to be due. Failure to pay or tender to the defendant the full amount before filing the petition stands as a bar to any of the relief sought, and the defect is fatal to the further prosecution of the action.

       Under application of this maxim, before a borrower who has executed a deed to secure a debt can have affirmative equitable relief such as the setting aside of a sale by the creditor under exercise of a power contained in a security deed, and injunction against the creditor and persons claiming under him, to prevent interference with the debtor's possession of the property, such debtor must pay or tender to the creditor the principal and interest due.

       In suit to cancel a tax deed upon the ground of excessive levy, seeking an accounting as to some of the defendants and general relief as to all of them where it appeared from allegations of the petition that each of the defendants was liable to the plaintiffs for trespass upon the property in a sum greater than the amount of the taxes for which the property was sold, and that the plaintiffs were willing to do equity, the allegations in regard to excessive levy and the prayer for cancellation on that ground were not deficient for failure of the plaintiffs to allege a previous tender of the amount of the taxes. Zugar v. Scarbrough, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 310</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 854</cite> (1938).

       One who by inheritance succeeds to the interest of such original owner in the property will not be heard in equity when seeking to cancel the deed of the purchaser at such sale, on the ground that the levy was excessive, without paying or offering to pay all unpaid taxes due on said property when the ownership thereon was in the person from whom it was inherited. Lowe v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 76</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 891</cite> (1940), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 317</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 171</cite> (1942).

       One seeking relief against collection of municipal taxes on the ground of excessiveness of the levies, or for other cause, but admitting, either expressly or by necessary implication, that he owes part of the tax covered by such executions, must pay or offer to pay the amount of the taxes admitted to be due, in order to obtain the relief sought. Kent v. Mayor of Alamo, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 445</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 769</cite> (1942).

       A borrower who has executed a deed to secure a debt is not entitled to an injunction against a sale of the property under a power in the deed, unless he first pays or tenders to the creditor the amount admittedly due. Oliver v. Slack, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 7</cite>, <cite class="app_court">14 S.E.2d 593</cite> (1941); Cook v.

       In a suit by a purchaser for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land, it should be made to appear that before institution of the action the plaintiff had paid or tendered the purchase-money according to the contract, or that tender had been waived by the defendant. Washington Mfg. Co. v. Wickersham, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 635</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 206</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Purchaser seeking specific performance of contract of purchase of realty is required under statute to do equity by tendering the amount admittedly due under the contract in order to obtain the relief sought. Shepard v. Gettys, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 392</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 272</cite> (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where purchaser seeking performance of contract of purchase of realty offered to do equity by paying the full amount of the purchase price, but the defendant repudiated the contract and declared his intentions not to carry out the contract, defendant's repudiation was a waiver of tender, and under the law relieved the petitioner of any obligation to tender. Shepard v. Gettys, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 392</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 272</cite> (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since a defendant is not required to perform under the terms of a contract if the plaintiff is currently in default, specific performance may not be decreed against appellee unless it is conditioned on appellant's curing of any default on his part, but if the decree is so conditioned, this section will be satisfied. Jordan v. Flynt, <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 359</cite>, <cite class="app_court">240 S.E.2d 858</cite> (1977); Krauth v. Bagley, <cite class="ga_court">243 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">252 S.E.2d 504</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The decree of specific performance is improper where the plaintiff was in default at the time suit was filed, he remains in default at the time of the decree, and the decree of specific performance is not conditional on the plaintiff curing his default. Jordan v. Flynt, <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 359</cite>, <cite class="app_court">240 S.E.2d 858</cite> (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where the plaintiff is not in default when he files suit, the occurrence of a subsequent default of the plaintiff is not by itself a sufficient reason for denying specific performance. Krauth v. Bagley, <cite class="ga_court">243 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">252 S.E.2d 504</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Petition for cancellation of deed was not subject to demurrer (now motion to dismiss) because the petitioner failed to tender to the defendant moneys paid for taxes, improvements, interest, and payment on loan, as well as the consideration paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, where the petition alleged that no part of the consideration named in the deed had been paid and that the rent collected by the defendant was enough to have paid the installments and interest due against said property, and there was nothing in the record to indicate that any improvements were made by the defendant, or any taxes paid by him. Wellborn v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 389</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 16</cite> (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where vendees of land may have been excused from tendering the correct amount, or any amount, to the vendor before suit for specific performance, this does not relieve them from offering in their pleadings to pay the amount which is due or the amount which might be found due by decree of the court. Lively v. Munday, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 409</cite>, <cite class="app_court">40 S.E.2d 62</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While ordinarily, before one would be entitled to set aside a tax sale on the grounds that the levy under the execution was excessive, he must tender to the purchaser at such sale the amount paid by such purchaser at the sale, no such tender is required where the petition alleges that the purchaser had not paid any part of the amount of its bid to the sheriff. Bibb County v. Elkan, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 520</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 7</cite> (1937); Durham v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 565</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 734</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Generally equity will not cancel a conveyance under which anything has been received, until repayment is made. An exception to the rule requiring tender is where the petition alleges that the defendant has been in possession, receiving the rents and profits of the premises conveyed, and prays for an accounting therefor by the defendant, and that the correct amount due him be declared and set up. Harrell v. Burch, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 96</cite>, <cite class="app_court">23 S.E.2d 434</cite> (1942).
       </p>

       Allegations of a petition that the petitioner's mutual savings and loan association has been unable to ascertain the exact amount that a tax execution should have issued for, and that the taxing authorities of the city have "refused to ascertain the exact amount legally due by" petitioner, when considered in the light of the fact that city contends that the total amount of the execution is the amount "legally due" and that the ascertainment of the amount for which petitioner contends the execution should have issued is a mere matter of mathematical calculation, based upon the valuation of the property which petitioner admits is legally taxable and the tax rate applicable thereto, do not allege a sufficient reason for the failure of the petitioner to pay or offer to pay the amount admittedly due. Elder v. Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 258</cite>, <cite class="app_court">194 S.E. 745</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where to a proceeding to foreclose a deed to secure debt as an equitable mortgage, which prays for judgment for principal, interest, and attorney's fees, a debtor files a plea in which it is alleged that the petitioner held as collateral fire insurance policies with a loss-payable clause in favor of the petitioner aggregating more than the amount of the debt, which had become due and payable as the result of a fire some months before there was a default on the debt, and that the insurance could have been collected at any time, but was not collected due solely to the negligence of the petitioner who had made no demand for payment, and that the attorney's fees sought in the foreclosure proceeding would have been unnecessary had such collection been made, such plea alleged facts sufficient to show a breach of duty, both in law and in equity, upon the part of the creditor, which would prevent it from collecting attorney's fees and deny the creditor any relief in equity. Irwin v. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 354</cite> (1948).

       <p>
        <p>
       Where the creditor has negligently failed to perform its duty, which results in default on the main debt, the resulting injury or additional expense should be paid by the creditor rather than by the debtors. Irwin v. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 354</cite> (1948).

       As a general rule a petition to a court of equity to cancel a deed as a cloud on the title of the grantor, brought by the executrices of the grantor's estate, on the basis that it is void as representing a sale by a wife of her separate estate to her husband, for a valuable consideration, without an order of the superior court of her domicile, when there is no offer to return the consideration recited and acknowledged in the deed to have been received, is demurrable (now motion to dismiss), but where it is alleged in an amendment to the petition that the consideration stated in the deed from the wife to the husband has been only partly paid to a stated amount, that the defendant has been in possession of the property so conveyed for a stated number of years, that the rents, issues, and profits for said period are at least a stated amount, and an offer is made to pay the defendant any difference between the consideration actually paid and the rents, issues, and profits, and the petition contains a prayer for general relief as well as for cancellation and injunction, such allegation by amendment is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this section, and it is not necessary that a formal tender of the consideration stated in the deed be made. Franklin v. Cruce, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 58</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 135</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In suit by wife for injunction against sale of property under deed, if the petition has shown upon its face, either expressly or impliedly, that any part of the purchase-money had been paid by or for the bank, or that any binding obligation for such payment had been made, it may be that the plaintiff could not maintain an action for equitable relief without averring a repayment of the sum or a tender thereof before suit, or alleging some valid reason for her failure to do so. Deen v. Baxley State Bank, <cite class="ga_court">192 Ga. 300</cite>, <cite class="app_court">15 S.E.2d 194</cite> (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a suit for specific performance, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the plaintiff because numerous fact issues remained, including whether the plaintiff made the requisite tender of the necessary documents and payment, whether the plaintiff's execution of corporate loan documents constituted a breach of the agreement and, if so, whether the breach was material, whether unclean hands barred the plaintiff's specific performance claim, and other issues. Krieger v. Bonds, <cite class="ga_app_court">333 Ga. App. 19</cite>, <cite class="app_court">775 S.E.2d 264</cite> (2015).

       This section is limited in its application
      
      to cases in which the party chargeable makes the third party his real or apparent agent, cases in which he provides the means intentionally, or for a dishonest purpose, or negligently, and cases in which he derives a benefit from the fraud of the third party. Nowell v. Mayor of Monroe, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 648</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 136</cite>, answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga.

      This section does not govern the great majority of cases where one innocently, for an honest purpose and with reasonable care, furnishes to a third party the means by which he perpetrates a fraud from which he who provides the means derives no benefit.

       <p>
        <p>
       - The principle stated in this Code section is applicable in conversion cases. Atlanta Classic Cars, Inc. v. Chih Hung USA Auto Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">209 Ga. App. 908</cite>, <cite class="app_court">439 S.E.2d 498</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When items stolen from an electric company were sold to a supply company, the electric company was not entitled to summary judgment on its conversion claim against the supply company and its principal, because of the equitable doctrine codified at O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c01s23-1-14" target="_self">23-1-14</a></cite>, providing that, when one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third person, the individual who put it in the power of the third person to inflict the injury shall bear the loss, as there were genuine fact issues as to whether the principal was innocent and whether the electric company's inattentiveness allowed its employee to steal the items with impunity. Fed. Ins. Co. v. Westside Supply Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">264 Ga. App. 240</cite>, <cite class="app_court">590 S.E.2d 224</cite> (2003).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The liability of an auctioneer for conversion does not extend to a case in which it is the true owner who originally enabled the auctioneer's principal to commit the underlying conversion and the auctioneer subsequently acts without knowledge of his principal's conversion. Benton v. Duvall Livestock Mktg., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">201 Ga. App. 430</cite>, <cite class="app_court">411 S.E.2d 307</cite> (1991).

       <p>
        <p>
       - As between one of two innocent parties who must suffer from a fraud of a third, he who furnished the means to commit the fraud, or whose negligence enables the third party to commit it, must bear the loss. McDonald v. Peoples Auto. Loan &amp; Fin. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 483</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 886</cite> (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where one of two innocent persons must bear a loss, the one who occasioned it or his representative cannot obtain affirmative relief in a court for the purpose of placing the loss upon the other party, who was equally innocent. Atlanta Banking &amp; Sav. Co. v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 313</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 904</cite> (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a loss must be suffered which results from the acts of one of two people, i.e., the act of the owner in delivering a stock power signed in blank, and the act of the corporate officers in accepting from the broker an unauthorized power, it must fall upon him who first trusted the defaulting broker. Frye v. Commonwealth Inv. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 739</cite>, <cite class="app_court">131 S.E.2d 569</cite>, aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">134 S.E.2d 39</cite> (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Equity required that as between the lender and the companies, the companies had to bear the loss for any alleged fraud by their agents. R.W. Holdco, Inc. v. SCI/RW Holdco, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">250 Ga. App. 414</cite>, <cite class="app_court">551 S.E.2d 826</cite> (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       By failing to file a lien, the pawnbroker enabled the automobile owners to perpetrate the fraud and must, therefore, bear the loss pursuant to this section. Cobb Ctr. Pawn &amp; Jewelry Brokers, Inc. v. Gordon, <cite class="ga_app_court">242 Ga. App. 73</cite>, <cite class="app_court">529 S.E.2d 138</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The law does not afford relief to one who suffers by not using the ordinary means of information that may be at hand,
       
       whether his neglect be due to indifference or credulity. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga.

         No legal duty by franchisor to consumer.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In a suit brought by a customer asserting conversion against an automobile franchisor and its financial company, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the franchisor and the financial company as the business entities owned no legal duty to the consumer to prevent the franchisee from presenting an unreasonable risk of harm to the customer. As such, the customer could not predicate liability for conversion under O.C.G.A.

      <p>
       <p>

       One of the essential elements of a cause of action for the common-law tort of deceit based upon fraud
      
      is the plaintiff's right to rely upon the representations. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 382</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E.2d 71</cite>, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 472</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The master could be held liable for the servant's fraudulent presentation
      
      of invoices and receiving payment for more goods than were actually delivered by reason of having clothed him with apparent authority and upon the equitable principle contained in this section that as between two innocent persons that he who put it in the power of the male-factor to inflict the loss should bear it. Lecroy v. Acme Meat Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 566</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E.2d 255</cite> (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Under ordinary conditions, in cases where a fraud has been committed by an agent, this rule (contained in this section) has been invoked against his principal for the reason that the employer, by clothing the agent with apparent authority to act for him, has made the accomplishment of the fraud possible. But the doctrine applies with equal force against the defrauded third person where it appears he could have easily detected the deceit and neglected to do so for, under such circumstances, his fault must be regarded as the proximate and efficient cause of the loss. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 382</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E.2d 71</cite>, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 472</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      A principal who puts a servant or other agent in a position which enables the agent while apparently acting within his authority, to commit a fraud upon third persons is subject to liability to such third persons for the fraud. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 382</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E.2d 71</cite>, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 472</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1966).

       <p>

       Misrepresentations are not actionable unless the plaintiff was justified in relying upon them in the exercise of common prudence and diligence.
      
      They must have been made under such circumstances that the injured party had a right to rely on them. Braselton Bros. v. Better Maid Dairy Prods., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga.

       - Where the owner of an automobile offers it for sale at an auction, and it is unconditionally delivered to such purchaser, the seller accepting a check for the purchase price, and such purchaser sells it for a valuable consideration to a third person who has no notice of the giving of the check, the title of the original owner is divested or he is estopped from asserting it as against the innocent third-party purchaser although the check is unpaid and returned as worthless.

       Wife's transfer and delivery of stock certificate to her husband operates to invest the husband with such external indicia of ownership that his pledge to an innocent lender is, on the principle of estoppel, binding upon her.

       As a general rule, equity will not grant relief to a party who comes into court with unclean hands,
      
      or is guilty of an illegal or immoral act, nor aid a grantor or his administrator in seeking to cancel a security deed which was executed by him for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors; these rules stem from the just and salutary principle that one will not be permitted to profit by his own wrong, and apply where a party is seeking the aid of equity in the enforcement of executory contracts or its aid under an executed contract.

       Where one is engaged with another in the simultaneous and willful violation of the same penal statute, he cannot recover damages for injuries inflicted upon him through the negligence of his joint wrongdoer unless the violation of the statute was not a contributing cause of the injuries; this is based upon the principle that the parties are in pari delicto, that what each does is the act of the other and that to permit a recovery under such circumstances would be in violation of public policy.

       An executed contract, such as an absolute conveyance purporting on its face to be a deed for the sale of land, though in fact a "mere sham" and made for the purpose of delaying or defrauding a creditor, is binding upon the maker, and he is estopped from impeaching it. Langan v. Langan, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E.2d 405</cite> (1968).

       A husband who, in order to delay or defeat the collection of a claim for alimony or other lawful demands against him, conveyed land to another person and put that person in possession, could not maintain against the latter an action for the breach of a bond given by him to reconvey the land whenever so required. This is so, not because the law is disposed to aid one of the wrongdoers in retaining the fruits of the unlawful transaction, but because it denies the benefit of its remedies to the other. Langan v.

      If after notice that one has made a contract to pass title to another to certain property, a third person cuts in, buys it, and takes a conveyance thereto, such person stands in the place of his vendor, and a court of equity, if it would decree specific performance of the contract by his vendor, will render a like decree against him.

       - Findings entered by a special master, which determined that the disputed portion of an alley belonged to a landowner, and not the neighbors, by operation of the landowner's prior recorded deed, was not clearly erroneous, as: (1) the landowner received the property via a valid deed; (2) the neighbors failed to put the landowner on notice of their claim; and (3) the neighbors' claim of possession and use was insufficient.

       - Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the plaintiff because the record showed that there was an issue of fact as to whether the defendants' possession of the property put the plaintiff on inquiry notice of the defendants' title despite the defendants' deed not being recorded.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Actual notice is shown, when the proof, positive or presumptive, authorizes the clear and satisfactory conclusion, that the purchaser had knowledge of the incumbrance, or would have had it, if he had not willfully declined to search for it, and thus his conscience is affected by it; and constructive notice, is that which arises out of a legal inference, or presumption strictly speaking, such as notice from a register, record, or some such matter; and which does not affect the conscience of the purchaser, because, notwithstanding the legal presumption, he may never have had absolute knowledge of the record or been put upon inquiry in relation to it.

       - Whatever is notice enough to excite attention and put the party on his guard and call for inquiry, is also notice of everything to which it is afterwards found that such inquiry might have led, although all was unknown for want of investigation; that is, where a person has sufficient information to lead him to a fact, he shall be deemed cognizant of it.

       Failure to take any action with respect to notice sufficient to excite inquiry justifies a presumption against the existence or validity of the right which one later seeks to assert, or justifies the presumption that if one ever possessed such a right it has been abandoned or waived or has been satisfied.

       Where defendant loan association had notice of the plaintiff's equity in the land at and before the time the association took its security deed from another person, such security deed was subject to cancellation as between the plaintiff and the association, whether or not it might still be treated as valid against the grantor to the extent of the latter's interest.

       When parties are furnished with a list of the jury, it is their duty, if they know that any of the jurors are disqualified, to call attention to the same, or the disqualification will be held to have been waived; if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that any of the jurors are disqualified, it is their duty to call attention to the fact, so that due inquiry may be made of the panel.

       The court did not err in overruling ground of motion for new trial based on alleged disqualification of juror whose mind, it was claimed, was not perfectly impartial between the state and the accused, where on consideration of the evidence introduced by the defendant and the state in reference to this ground, the judge was authorized to find that the juror was not disqualified as contended.

        Lease between a debtor and a county, which was recorded in county records, was properly attested, and contained a full legal description of real property, and which referred to a trust indenture 27 times, provided constructive notice to a bona fide purchaser of the unrecorded indenture and the mortgage lien it created and gave rise to a duty to inquire further, which would have lead to discovery of the unrecorded lien. Thus, because the mortgage lien was enforceable against a bona fide purchaser under Georgia law, it was not avoidable by a Chapter 11 trustee or a debtor in possession. Detention Mgmt., LLC v.

       - In a declaratory judgment action brought by the purchasers of certain real property to remove a cloud from the purchasers' title asserted by a bank who had obtained a writ of fieri facias (the lien) against one of the sellers, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the bank and holding that the purchasers had a duty to inquire as to prior names used by that seller. The purchasers provided expert testimony that the lien using that seller's married name had not been recorded and, in turn, the bank failed to present any evidence to dispute the affidavits of the purchasers' witnesses or to cite to any authority which imposed a duty on the purchasers or the purchasers' agents to investigate prior or alternative names of that seller when nothing occurred prior to or during the closing that created a duty to inquire and that seller had falsely sworn under oath that the property was not subject to any encumbrances or liens and that there were no outstanding judgments.

       - Trial court did not err in denying purchasers and the holders of two outstanding security deeds bona fide purchaser status because a quitclaim deed showed on the deed's face that a parent signed the deed as the children's purported "guardian"; thus, the designation of a "guardian" in the chain of title put the purchasers and holders on notice of the need to confirm the parent's legal authority to convey the children's interest in the property.

        Once prospective purchaser of property finds person in actual, open, visible, exclusive, and unambiguous possession
       
       of the property, he has an affirmative duty to inquire of the possessor concerning his rights in the premises and as a consequence of his failure to do so, he may not prevail as a purchaser for value without notice. Bacote v. Wyckoff, <cite class="ga_court">251 Ga. 862</cite>, <cite class="app_court">310 S.E.2d 520</cite> (1984).

        Chapter 7 trustee was not entitled to sell a debtor's property because the trustee was not a bona fide purchaser without notice;
       
       an examination of the deed book and page numbers used in transfers and assignments would have alerted a hypothetical purchaser to the uncertainty concerning the status of both assignees' interest in the property. The trustee's powers under 11 U.S.C.
   §
   544(a)(3) did not cut off the first assignee's rights to seek reformation of the mistakenly cancelled first deed because the second assignee's quitclaim release of the instrument assigned to the first assignee was sufficient to constitute notice that would excite attention and put a party on inquiry under O.C.G.A.

       Equity requires diligence,
      
      and will not do for one that which he could have done for himself but for his own negligence. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">202 Ga. App. 752</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 543</cite> (1947).

      An equitable action to cancel a deed on the ground of fraud, which clearly shows that the complainant failed to use even slight diligence to discover the fraud, fails to allege a cause of action. Equity will not grant relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of the truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the action. Whitfield v.

      Where a purchaser has knowledge of any fact sufficient to put a prudent man upon an inquiry which, if prosecuted with ordinary diligence, would lead to actual notice of some right or title in conflict with that he is about to purchase, it is his duty to make the inquiry; and, if he does not make it, he is guilty of bad faith or negligence to such extent that the law will presume that he made it, and will charge him with the actual notice he would have received if he had made it. Commodity Credit Corp. v. Wells, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 287</cite>, <cite class="app_court">3 S.E.2d 642</cite> (1939).

      The fact that the attorneys for the purchaser, and therefore the purchaser, have actual knowledge of the pendency of a suit for a money judgment in a tort action will not charge them with notice of the rendition of a judgment in that case, where no execution had been issued and recorded as provided by the statute, and they will not be chargeable with negligence, and therefore with notice, because they did not examine the papers in the suit, examine the bar docket, examine the minutes of the court, or make inquiry of plaintiff's counsel in that case, for: "What the law requires . . . to put innocent third parties upon notice of the existence of a judgment lien is an entry of the execution upon a certain record in the office of the clerk of the superior court. Where there is a failure to make such record, third parties are not charged with any duty to make an investigation or inquiry in relation to the existence of such a lien against their vendor."

      Once a cab company had knowledge that the diagnosis of a physician showed a cab operator-employee was subject to recurring loss of consciousness which rendered it dangerous for him to drive, mere failure of the cab company to ascertain whether or not he had made a recovery would fall under the head of "negligent ignorance" which would be insufficient to relieve it from liability for the unfortunate consequences following upon a seizure while the defendant was operating the taxicab.

      Notice which would charge a purchaser of personal property with negligence in not discovering a defect in the vendor's title, which the vendor impliedly warranted in the sale, is not the constructive notice derived from the record in the clerk's office as required by law of instruments affecting the title to property, before a purchaser can be charged with negligence in failing to discover a defect in the vendor's title to the property sold, the purchaser must have had actual notice of the defect, or notice of a fact sufficient to put the purchaser upon inquiry as to the state of the title to the property. Perrin v. Reardon, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 823</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E. 300</cite> (1932).

      The failure of a petitioner to know the content defining the coverage of its insurance contract or to compare the facts and circumstances surrounding the injury to ascertain if it was covered thereby, and its failure to inquire of the employer or the industrial board (Board of Worker's Compensation) as to the existence of an insurance contract with another insurance carrier that covered the injury, amounted to negligence on the part of the petitioner, and would not constitute such a mistake of fact as would render the agreement and the payments thereunder involuntary and, therefore, a basis for subrogation. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 752</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 543</cite> (1947).

       <p>
      Subrogation for voluntary payments is not allowed. Subrogation will be allowed, (1) where there are existing circumstances which in equity amount to an implied agreement for subrogation; or (2) where there is an agreement with either the debtor or the creditor whereby one making the payment will be subrogated to the rights and remedies of the original creditor.

         Purpose of doctrine of lis pendens.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Lis pendens, whether it be from the common law as provided in this section or by statute (T. 44, Ch. 14, Art. 9), has for its purpose the protection of innocent purchasers of real property involved in pending litigation. Patent Scaffolding Co. v. Byers, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 426</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 332</cite> (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Lis pendens is the jurisdiction, power, or control which courts acquire over property involved in a suit,
       
       pending the continuance of the action, and until the final judgment therein. Coleman v. Law, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 906</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 445</cite> (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The underlying, if not the sole, object of the maxim "pendente lite nihil innoverture," is to keep the subject of the suit or res within the power of the court until the judgment or decree shall be entered, and thus to make it possible for courts of justice to give effect to their judgments and decrees. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 294</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While special circumstances may alter the rule, it is the general rule that where the rights of the plaintiff to the property in question are secured under the rule of lis pendens, the judge in the exercise of his discretion may refuse an interlocutory injunction. Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. McAllister, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 626</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 558</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An application in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to probate a will, which, although denied for lack of evidence to prove it, was still pending therein, was not a suit within the meaning of the law of lis pendens, and did not operate so as to affect the title of one who purchased at the sale of the administrator, the appointment and sale taking place subsequently to an order of the ordinary (now probate judge) denying probate, although the will on the original application was thereafter duly probated. Scarborough v. Long, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 412</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 796</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">305 U.S. 637</cite>, <cite class="s_court">59 S. Ct. 107</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">83 L. Ed. 410</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        To the existence of a valid and effective lis pendens, it is essential that three elements be present:
       
       the property must be of a character to be subject to the rule; the court must have jurisdiction both of the person and the subject matter, and the property involved must be sufficiently described in the pleadings. Walker v. Houston, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 878</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E. 107</cite> (1933); Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 294</cite> (1933); Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. McAllister, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 626</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 558</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The general rule is that lis pendens, duly prosecuted, and not collusive, is notice to purchaser so as to affect and bind his interest by the decree.
       
       Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. McAllister, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 626</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 558</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Lis pendens in itself does not create a lien of any kind,
       
       but merely charges the purchaser with notice of the pending action. If the judgment in the pending action does not create a lien on the property, certainly notice of the action will not. Carmichael Tile Co. v. Yaarab Temple Bldg. Co., <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 318</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 294</cite> (1933).

       The doctrine of lis pendens applies to a suit brought by a creditor to prevent his debtor from conveying his property away
      
      with the fraudulent intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditor. Coleman v. Law, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 906</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 445</cite> (1930).

      Actions to reach property which has been fraudulently conveyed and suits to subject specific property to the payment of debts come within the doctrine of lis pendens. Coleman v. Law, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 906</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 445</cite> (1930).
      </p>

      The rule of lis pendens applies to a creditor's suit to set aside a fraudulent conveyance made to defeat the creditor, so that the purchasers or other persons, acquiring interests pendente lite, take title subject to the decree in the suit. Coleman v. Law, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 906</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 445</cite> (1930); Walker v. Houston, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 878</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E. 107</cite> (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The doctrine of lis pendens, properly understood and applied, will prevent a stranger from dealing with any of the parties to a pending proceeding in which a title to, or an interest in, or a lien upon designated and described real property is sought to be enforced after the proceeding is filed, and before the final decree, so as to acquire any interest in the premises involved capable of withstanding the force of the decree, or frustrating its full legal effect. Atlanta Nat'l Bank v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">173 Ga. 213</cite>, <cite class="app_court">159 S.E. 874</cite> (1931).

      If a lessee for sawmill purposes of growing trees sells the same on a valuable consideration, and afterwards colludes with a third person, who at the time of the sale has a suit pending against such lessee to establish and enforce an outstanding equitable interest in the trees, and so colluding accepts a valuable consideration from the third person, and on the basis thereof allows a consent verdict and decree for the plaintiff without trial of the issues in the case, such verdict and decree will be subject to collateral attack by the vendee as void on the ground of fraud, and will not be protected on the principle of lis pendens. In such a situation such third person should be treated as a subsequent purchaser, and not as one whose original claim became adjudicated in his favor. Ingram &amp; Le Grand Lumber Co. v. Burgin Lumber Co., <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 404</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 774</cite> (1942).

       <p>
      A suit for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land is "notice" of the claim that the plaintiff sets up therein, from the time it is commenced and docketed; and if duly prosecuted and not collusive, one purchasing the land pending the suit is affected by the final decree rendered therein, though the suit is in a county other than the one in which the land is located. Walker v. Houston, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 878</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E. 107</cite> (1933).

       Lis pendens does not apply to choses in action.

       - Bonner v. Norwest Bank Inc., <cite class="ga_court">275 Ga. 620</cite> (2002), is inconsistent with the Second Refuge Church Inc. v. Lollar, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 721</cite> (2007), line of cases and is overruled to the extent that the case extends the bona fide purchaser for value doctrine to those acquiring title under a grantee in a forged deed; Mabra v. Deutsche Bank Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">277 Ga. App. 764</cite>, (2006), is likewise overruled as Mabra also runs contrary to the Lollar line of cases, which does not recognize that the bona fide purchaser for value doctrine may apply when forgery occurs between spouses.

       A presumption of good faith attaches to one who is a purchaser for value,
      
      which remains until overcome by proof. Patellis v. Tanner, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 304</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 84</cite> (1945).
      </p>

      A son shown to have been born subsequently to the execution of a will is not entitled to recover in ejectment against a purchaser for a valid consideration who relied on the judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) probating the will in solemn form, and who purchased prior to any proceeding to set aside such judgment. Mitchell v. Arnall, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E.2d 258</cite> (1948).

       <p>
      Where an administrator sells his decedent's estate at public outcry and he buys back as an individual the property on the same day that he as administrator conveyed it away, the fact that the deeds were made on the same day and recited the same consideration does not amount to a void administrator's sale, and notice of the alleged fraud is not presumed. When later purchasers of the land pay value in money for the land purchased, they are presumed to be bona fide purchasers without notice. Thomas v. Couch, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 602</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 206</cite> (1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      It was not error to refuse to charge the principle that, when one attests a deed with full knowledge of its contents, he is estopped to assert an interest in the land conveyed outstanding in himself against the grantee; the evidence that a witness to petitioner's tax deed was an agent of the owner and grantor of the defendant did not authorize it, and even if the act and knowledge of the agent were attributed to the owner, defendant, without notice thereof, would not be bound. McDonald v. Wimpy, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 270</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E.2d 524</cite> (1949).
      </p>

       <p>

       A purchaser of real estate is not bound by recitals in a deed executed by his grantor to realty not embraced in his purchase,
      
      and which therefore does not constitute a muniment in his chain of title. Thompson v. Randall, <cite class="ga_court">173 Ga. 696</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 377</cite> (1931).

       A bona fide sale of property, not made to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, is not rendered invalid because the vendor may have been insolvent at the time.

       - Superior court did not err in granting a purchaser summary judgment in an administrator's action alleging that the purchaser aided and abetted an executor's breach of fiduciary duties when it bought properties from the executor but did not meet its burden of proving payment merely by producing recitations of the alleged consideration; the probate court's order authorizing the executor to disburse estate property was valid on its face, the sale did not violate the terms of the power of sale in a testatrix's will, and the sale of real estate to an innocent purchaser divested the title of the heirs, although there could be irregularities.

        The rule in this section is subject to a notable exception;
       
       and that is, a conveyance is not protected when made back to a former owner who had notice of the equity, and who did not originally derive title through a bona fide holder. Thompson v. Randall, <cite class="ga_court">173 Ga. 696</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 377</cite> (1931).

       - Trial court erred in holding that a mortgage company had a valid security interest as to the other one-half undivided interest in certain property because the company could not acquire a valid security interest in the entire property by virtue of the company's status, if any, as a bona fide purchaser for value; a bona fide purchaser for value, or a security deed holder occupying such position, obtains good title notwithstanding a forgery in the chain of title. Brock v. Yale Mortg. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">287 Ga. 849</cite>, <cite class="app_court">700 S.E.2d 583</cite> (2010).
       </p>

       A 2003 warranty deed that operated to release a prior lender's security interest in the property was not a forgery but was signed by someone fraudulently assuming the authority of an officer of the prior lender and was regular on the deed's face. Therefore, a subsequent lender that foreclosed on the property and purchased the property at the foreclosure sale was a bona fide purchaser for value entitled to take the property free of the prior lender's security interest. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., <cite class="ga_app_court">307 Ga. App. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">704 S.E.2d 823</cite> (2010).

         Protection of purchaser with notice predicated on bona fides of vendor.

        <p>
       - A purchaser of land with notice of outstanding equities, from one who was without notice thereof and was entitled to status of bona fide purchaser, will be protected in his title on account of the bona fides of his vendor, and it is wholly immaterial of what nature the equity is, whether it is a lien, or an encumbrance, or a trust, or any other claim; for a bona fide purchaser of an estate, for a valuable consideration, purges away the equity from the estate in the hands of all persons who may derive title to it. Thompson v. Randall, <cite class="ga_court">173 Ga. 696</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 377</cite> (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A deed of prior date loses its priority over a subsequent deed from the same vendor, which is based on a valuable consideration, taken without notice of the existence of the first and is the second deed being the first to go to record in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the land lies, and even if the vendee in the second deed took with notice, a grantee of the latter who took without notice would be protected.

        <p>
       - Trial court erred in holding that a mortgage company had a valid security interest as to the other one-half undivided interest in certain property because the company could not acquire a valid security interest in the entire property by virtue of the company's status, if any, as a bona fide purchaser for value; a bona fide purchaser for value, or a security deed holder occupying such position, obtains good title notwithstanding a forgery in the chain of title. Brock v. Yale Mortg. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">287 Ga. 849</cite>, <cite class="app_court">700 S.E.2d 583</cite> (2010).

        <p>
       Bonner v. Norwest Bank Inc., <cite class="ga_court">275 Ga. 620</cite> (2002), is inconsistent with the Second Refuge Church Inc. v. Lollar, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 721</cite> (2007), line of cases and is overruled to the extent that the case extends the bona fide purchaser for value doctrine to those acquiring title under a grantee in a forged deed; Mabra v. Deutsche Bank Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">277 Ga. App. 764</cite> (2006), is likewise overruled as Mabra also runs contrary to the Lollar line of cases, which does not recognize that the bona fide purchaser for value doctrine may apply when forgery occurs between spouses. Brock v. Yale Mortg. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">287 Ga. 849</cite>, <cite class="app_court">700 S.E.2d 583</cite> (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A bona fide purchaser without notice acquires an unqualified legal right and title to the property purchased;
       
       and a court of equity has no jurisdiction to interfere with such vested legal right and title. Gamble v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 662</cite>, <cite class="app_court">153 S.E. 759</cite> (1930); Jenkins v. Sosebee, 74 Bankr. 440 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Therefore, a bona fide purchaser for value, and without notice of an equity, will not be interfered with by a court of equity
       
       and this doctrine proceeds on the idea that the equity of the innocent purchaser is superior to that of the cestui que trust, who stands silently by and permits such purchaser to act to his own injury, or who is guilty of laches in not sooner asserting a mere secret equity. Gamble v. Brooks, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 662</cite>, <cite class="app_court">153 S.E. 759</cite> (1930).

       Plaintiff may not reform his deed because of mutual mistake, third party acquired her title subsequently to that deed and is an innocent purchaser without notice of such mistake. Cox v. Zucker, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 44</cite>, <cite class="app_court">102 S.E.2d 580</cite> (1958).

       Where the absolute title to property is apparently in a vendor or mortgagor, the vendee or mortgagee is protected, unless the one seeking to set up a lien or trust against the property can show that the vendee or mortgagee had notice of trust funds having gone into the property. Tattnall Bank v. Harvey, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 752</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 724</cite> (1938).

        <p>
       - In a suit on a promissory note by a lender's assignee, although some evidence supported the borrowers' claim that terms in a Forbearance Agreement (FA) binding the guarantors were the product of mutual mistake and release of the guarantors was intended, the trial court erred in reforming the FA because the borrowers had not overcome the presumption that the assignee was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the mistake. Hamilton State Bank v. Kelly Capital Invs., LLC, <cite class="ga_app_court">335 Ga. App. 252</cite>, <cite class="app_court">779 S.E.2d 757</cite> (2015).

        While it is the rule that a bona fide purchaser of property in which trust funds have been invested is protected,
       
       the beneficiary of a trust estate may at his option, within a reasonable time, "affirm or reject an unauthorized investment by the trustee," and equity will aid the beneficiary in recovering the funds or property, or enforcing a lien for the wrongfully used funds, provided that the assets can be traced and remain in the hands of a person "affected with notice of the misapplication." Tattnall Bank v. Harvey, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 752</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E. 724</cite> (1938).

       While proof of payment of the purchase money alone raises a presumption of good faith, and carries the burden of claimant, where no testimony was introduced to prove that the consideration recited in the deed was in fact paid, nor was it otherwise proved to have been paid, the recital of the consideration in the deed and the recital therein that it was paid does not carry the burden of proving payment of the purchase money.

       The fact that the owner of the automobile, estranged from her husband, negligently allowed her husband to get possession of the keys and the automobile and to thereafter drive it to another city and sell it to a dealer in automobiles of the same make was not such an act as clothed the husband, who had no interest therein, with the external indicia of ownership and right of disposition, so as to enable him to pass the dealer such title to the automobile that the dealer could in turn give to a third-party purchaser clear title which would defeat the right of the true owner to recover the same in a trover action, nor did the act require a finding that the third-party purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any infirmity in the title to the automobile.

       - It is a rule in equity that a bona fide purchaser without notice, to be entitled to protection, must be so, not only at the time of the contract or conveyance, but until the purchase money is actually paid.

        <p>
       A partial payment of the purchase money before notice of the equitable title of the true owners, although not sufficient to invest the vendee with the character of a bona fide purchaser as regards the entire estate purchased, will entitle him to invoke the aid of the equitable principle that he who asks equity must do equity and to be reimbursed for the amount actually paid before.

       - Where grievance is not that Public Service Commission refuses to hear and act upon an application of the telephone company for increased rates, but that the commission, having so heard and acted thereon, has fixed rates that are confiscatory, mandamus could merely require that the commission act again in the exercise of that discretion vested in it by law. If the evidence shows that the rates ordered will result in confiscation, equity has jurisdiction to render the judgment complained of. Rates that are unjustly and unreasonably low are confiscatory.

       - Where there are no express words of defeasance, forfeiture, or reversion, words in a deed will be construed as words of covenant and not words of condition. The remedy for a breach by one having the right to enforce the same is an action for damages and not a forfeiture of the estate for condition broken. Fulford v. Fulford, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 9</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 848</cite> (1969); Kitchens v. Atlantic Steel Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">123 Ga.

         Determination of condition precedent or subsequent.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While it is not always easy to determine whether the condition created by the terms of a conveyance is precedent or subsequent, the general rule is that, if the act or condition required does not necessarily precede the vesting of the estate, but may accompany or follow it, and if the act may as well be done after as before vesting of the estate, or if from the nature of the act to be performed, it is evidently the intention of the parties that the estate shall vest and the grantee perform the act taking possession, then the condition is subsequent. Gordon v. Whittle, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 339</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 169</cite> (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If, upon a strict construction of a deed in its entirety (there being no express words of defeasance), it should be doubtful whether the instrument created an estate upon condition subsequent, or the words employed imported covenant, the latter construction should be adopted. Fulford v. Fulford, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 9</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 848</cite> (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where a deed purports to convey a fee simple title and there is no provision in the deed for a forfeiture of the estate or a reversion to the grantor in the event the grantee conveyed the property to another without the consent of his brothers, restrictive words in the deed are words of covenant and not a condition subsequent. Fulford v. Fulford, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 9</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 848</cite> (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A deed will not be construed as a grant on condition subsequent unless the language used by express terms creates an estate on condition or unless the intent of the grantor to create a conditional estate is manifest from a reading of the entire instrument. Gordon v. Whittle, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 339</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 169</cite> (1950); Fulford v. Fulford, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 9</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 848</cite> (1969); Floyd v. Hoover, <cite class="ga_app_court">141 Ga.

       Deed that the grantor, in consideration of payment by grantees of certain indebtedness and of their support and maintenance of him during the remainder of his life, conveyed the described premises, did not create a condition subsequent which, upon the failure of the grantees to support and maintain the grantor, would result in a forfeiture of the estate conveyed, but such language created a covenant binding the grantees therein to perform; upon their failure to perform, if the grantor had been in life, he might have rescinded the contract by restoring to the grantees that part of the consideration represented by the payment of his indebtedness, offset by any profits they might have derived from the conveyance to them. Jones v. Reid, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 764</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E. 235</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Provision in deed that title "reverts back to the grantor if the grantee denies grantor her right to live on said property with him as his wife or without him" created a valid condition subsequent, and stipulated in terms that a breach of such condition by the grantee husband would cause the title to revert; and this would give to the grantor wife the right of reentry; however, if performance by the husband of such a condition subsequent was made impossible by acts or conduct on the part of the wife herself, the rule would be otherwise. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 223</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 771</cite> (1938).

       Courts do not generally favor forfeitures and this rule is applicable to insurance contracts.
      
      Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Torrance, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 4</cite>, <cite class="app_court">137 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1964), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 639</cite>, <cite class="app_court">140 S.E.2d 840</cite> (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       But while forfeitures are not favored, they are not altogether prohibited in this state.
      
      Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Torrance, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 4</cite>, <cite class="app_court">137 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1964), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 639</cite>, <cite class="app_court">140 S.E.2d 840</cite> (1965).

      <p>
       <p>
      Conditions subsequent in deeds, although not favored, will be enforced by the court when they are clearly created and are not inconsistent with the other terms of the conveyance, and are not rendered impossible by the act of God or by the subsequent conduct of the grantor.

      While forfeitures are not unlawful, the law does not favor them, and all ambiguities in a contract are to be resolved against their existence; but where a contract in unmistakable terms provides for a forfeiture, and is otherwise free from legal infirmity, neither a court of law nor a court of equity will relieve against the forfeiture. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Torrance, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 4</cite>, <cite class="app_court">137 S.E.2d 551</cite> (1964), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 639</cite>, <cite class="app_court">140 S.E.2d 840</cite> (1965).

      The condition subsequent, with right of reentry, and forfeiture of the estate conveyed grantee, is not void because it could work a forfeiture. If a valid limitation imposed against alienation is interwoven with, so as to constitute a part of, the grant itself, the grant will be treated as a defeasible estate, and upon the inhibition being violated the estate conveyed is forfeited and terminates. Floyd v. Hoover, <cite class="ga_app_court">141 Ga. App. 588</cite>, <cite class="app_court">234 S.E.2d 89</cite> (1977).

      Conditions in a deed which tend to destroy an estate are not favored in law and such conditions must be strictly construed against forfeiture. Kitchens v.

      Where there is a breach of a covenant which authorizes the forfeiture of the lease, the prompt assertion thereof by the lessor will operate to defeat the lessee's privilege to renew, however, forfeitures by acts of a party to a lease because of a breach of a covenant or condition are not favored by the courts. Pritchett v. King, <cite class="ga_app_court">56 Ga. App. 788</cite>, <cite class="app_court">194 S.E. 44</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The general rule is that the breach by a lessee of the covenants or stipulations on his part contained in the lease does not work a forfeiture of the term in the absence of an express proviso to that effect in the lease, the lessor's remedy being by way of a claim for damages. Pritchett v. King, <cite class="ga_app_court">56 Ga. App. 788</cite>, <cite class="app_court">194 S.E. 44</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where a contract does not provide in express terms for a forfeiture upon a breach of the covenant, the presumption is that the lessor will be content with such right as is conferred by the ordinary remedies. Pritchett v. King, <cite class="ga_app_court">56 Ga. App. 788</cite>, <cite class="app_court">194 S.E. 44</cite> (1937).

       - A plaintiff would not be compelled to elect between a legacy and a "mere claim" to property until after there has been an adjudication of the question whether or not he is in fact the owner of an interest in the property disposed of by the will, and then only in the event this issue is determined in his favor; since, if he were first compelled to elect, and he should for any reason fail in the trial to establish his claim, there would be no defeated or disappointed legatees to compensate, but, on the contrary, the other legatees would get the very property he claimed.

         Election is choice between proffered benefit and retention of own property.

        <p>
       - An "election" in equity is a choice which a person is compelled to make between the acceptance of a benefit under an instrument and the retention of his own property which is attempted to be disposed of by that instrument. Rieves v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 372</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The doctrine of election as applied to wills, against one claiming inconsistent benefits, arises when the testator "has attempted to give property not his own, and has given a benefit to a person to whom that property belongs," in which case "the devisee or legatee shall elect either to take under or against the will." It is applicable where the instrument confers upon one a benefit while attempting to dispose of his own property, in which event such person must elect whether to accept the benefit under the instrument or retain his property. However, this doctrine does not apply where testamentary disposition describes no specific property so as to identify it with that of the claimant, but describes the property only generally, as "all my real and personal property and all property of every kind and character owned by me at my death," since the testator would be presumed to have intended to bequeath only what he actually owned and could lawfully dispose of. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Roberts, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 472</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 12</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A case of election only arises when a person is entitled to one of two benefits to each of which he has the legal title,
       
       and an election can exist only where there is a choice between two or more inconsistent remedies actually existing at the time of election. Rieves v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 372</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The choice is compulsory between two inconsistent rights or claims where there is a clear intention of the testator that the beneficiary shall not enjoy both. Rieves v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 372</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where a testator, after devising property owned by him to one beneficiary, assumes to devise to another property belonging to the first devisee, the devisee of the property owned by the testator, if he accepts the devise with knowledge of the facts, is precluded from asserting a claim to his own property devised to the other beneficiary. The beneficiary must elect between keeping his own and taking what is given by the will. Rieves v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 372</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The fact that a sheriff who had collected taxes which were unaccounted for, had given a bond with a surety, conditioned on the faithful performance of his duties, would not create a case for compulsory election, so as to require the county officials claiming the tax moneys to relinquish, for the benefit of a creditor bank, their direct claim of priority from the funds of the decedent in the registry of the court, and to proceed, with delay and additional expense, by a suit on the bond. Savannah Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Meldrim, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 765</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 567</cite> (1943).

       The equitable doctrine of laches is not applicable to suits at law.
      
      Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dempsey, <cite class="ga_app_court">120 Ga. App. 5</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E.2d 349</cite> (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Equity will relieve against mutual mistake, but only at the instance of a complainant who moves with reasonable diligence.
      
      What is a reasonable time must necessarily depend upon the peculiar facts and environments of the particular case. Parker v. Fisher, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 3</cite>, <cite class="app_court">59 S.E.2d 715</cite> (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       And if both parties are equally to blame for delay, neither should be allowed to invoke the rule of laches
      
      in order to gain advantage over his adversary. City of McRae v. Folsom, <cite class="ga_court">191 Ga. 272</cite>, <cite class="app_court">11 S.E.2d 900</cite> (1940); Davis v. Newton, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 75</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 153</cite> (1961).

       There is no principle of equity sounder, more conservative and more prolific, in all the fruits of peace, than this:
      
      that he who slumbers over his rights, with no impediment to his asserting them, until the evidence upon which a counterclaim is founded, may from lapse of time, be presumed to be lost; until the generation cognizant of the transactions between the parties, has passed away, and until original actors are in their graves, and their affairs are left to representatives - the law, in the exercise of an equitable sovereignty, presumes it to be unjust, that under such circumstances, a complainant should be heard; and in nine cases out of ten, it is unjust in fact, as well as in theory. The principle upon which courts of equity proceed in such cases, is, that the lateness of the demand, arising from lapse of time, is presumptive evidence against its justice. Welch v. Welch, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 198</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 757</cite> (1959).

       Equity will not aid in the enforcement of stale demands.

       <p>
      Defendant's suit is properly barred by laches when defendant's claim of a resulting trust in a house is based on payments made 35 years ago to a person who is the sole record owner and is now dead. Stone v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">265 Ga. 480</cite>, <cite class="app_court">458 S.E.2d 343</cite> (1995).

       The rule that equity will not aid in the enforcement of stale demands applies to accounts.
      
      Cannon v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 609</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 917</cite> (1950).

      <p>
       <p>
      In a suit to rescind the sale of land, the plaintiff's voluntary failure to bring suit for three years after being fully cognizant of the fraud committed seven years prior thereto is such laches as will bar his action. Hillis v. Clark, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 604</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 922</cite> (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where no legal redemption of the land is alleged, or claimed, but the redemption is entirely an equitable one, persons claiming thereunder must assert their equitable demands within a reasonable time, for since equity rewards the vigilant, not the slothful, where the delay is such as to render the ascertainment of the truth difficult, equity will give no relief. Slade v. Barber, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 405</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1946).
      </p>

       <p>
      Even after the dissolution of a partnership, the statute of limitations does not begin to run in favor of one partner against another until the partnership affairs, as to debtors and creditors of the firm, have been wound up and settled, or, at least, a sufficient time has elapsed since the dissolution to raise the presumption that such was the fact, nor, while there are outstanding assets and liabilities, will a partner be barred as against his copartner, on the principle of stale demands. Powell v. Powell, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 840</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 677</cite> (1931), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 817</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 566</cite> (1934).

       There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes laches or staleness of demand,
      
      and no one decision constitutes a precedent in the strict sense for another. Each case is to be determined according to its own particular circumstances. Laches is not, like limitations, a mere matter of time, but principally a question of the inequity of permitting the claim to be enforced, an inequity founded on some intermediate change in conditions. Bleckley v. Bleckley, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 47</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 206</cite> (1939); Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 693</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 534</cite> (1946).

       Laches is not, like limitations, a mere matter of time.

      <p>
       <p>

       And in determining whether there has been laches, there are various things to be considered,
      
      notably the duration of the delay in asserting the claim, and the sufficiency of the excuse offered in extenuation of the delay, whether plaintiff acquiesced in the assertion or operation of the corresponding adverse claim, the character of the evidence by which plaintiff's right is sought to be established, whether during the delay the evidence of the matters in dispute has been lost or become obscured or the conditions have so changed as to render the enforcement of the right inequitable, whether third persons have acquired intervening rights.

       Delay in bringing suit must not be such as to preclude the court from arriving at a safe conclusion
      
      as to the truth of the matters in controversy, and thus make the doing of equity either doubtful or impossible, due to loss or obscuration of evidence of the transaction in issue, or where the lapse of time has been sufficient to create or justify a presumption that, if the plaintiff was ever possessed of a right, it had been abandoned, waived, or satisfied. Citizens' &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Ellis, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 603</cite> (1931); Flemister v.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      While most frequently the bar of laches is applied in instances where the long delay has rendered the ascertainment of the truth difficult, the doctrine does not rest on that premise alone. Johnson v. Sears, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 541</cite> (1945).

      An unreasonable delay until the death of essential witnesses, which practically precludes the court from arriving at a safe conclusion as to the truth of the matters in controversy, and which make the doing of equity either doubtful or impossible, due to loss or obscuration of evidence of the transaction in issue, will bar the action. Stephens v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 537</cite> (1942).

      A delay of 40 years or more, and the death of essential witnesses, when the truth of matters in controversy cannot be fairly established, makes the doing of equity either doubtful or impossible, and will bar the action.

       To charge a party with laches in delaying to assert a right, an opportunity to have acted sooner must have existed;
      
      if he acted at the first possible opportunity, he is not culpable. Cooper v. Aycock, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 658</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 895</cite> (1945).

      In a suit to cancel a deed on the ground of the grantor's insanity, when no reason appeared why the plaintiffs did not know, or by the slightest diligence could not have known, of the substantial facts, so as to bring the suit within a reasonable time after the deed was executed and after the grantor's death, the action was properly dismissed on demurrer (now motion to dismiss) on the ground that it was stale and that the plaintiffs were in laches. Hillis v. Clark, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 604</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 922</cite> (1966).

       To prevail on a plea of laches, it is essential that the pleading party prove harm caused him by the delay.

      The defendant's plea of laches in a suit brought to enjoin the defendant from extending a parking area onto land zoned for single family dwellings, cannot be sustained, where no facts are alleged to show any prejudice to the defendant, or that the ascertainment of the truth is made more difficult by any delay on the part of the plaintiffs to immediately seek relief against the defendant for the unlawful use of his property. Palmer v. Tomlinson, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 399</cite>, <cite class="app_court">122 S.E.2d 578</cite> (1961).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>

       Laches is not, like limitations, a mere matter of time, but principally a question of the inequity
      
      of permitting the claim to be enforced, an inequity founded on some intermediate change in conditions. Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 693</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 534</cite> (1946); Whitfield v. Whitfield, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 64</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 852</cite> (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Laches does not arise from mere lapse of time.
      
      Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dempsey, <cite class="ga_app_court">120 Ga. App. 5</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E.2d 349</cite> (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       And in fixing the time when the bar of laches may be interposed, the court does not measure altogether by the lapse of time,
      
      because this section declares that: "Equity gives no relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of the truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the right." Bass v. Mayor of Milledgeville, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 156</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 529</cite> (1934), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">295 U.S. 721</cite>, <cite class="s_court">55 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Laches is an equitable doctrine which is independent of the statute of limitations,
      
      and as to the lapse of time necessary for invoking the doctrine of laches, such time may or may not correspond with the time specified in the statute of limitations. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Sailors, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 628</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 557</cite> (1943); Johnson v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While the equitable doctrine of laches operates independently of any statute of limitations, courts of equity usually act in obedience and in analogy to the statutes of limitations, in cases where it would not be unjust and inequitable to do so. Cooper v. Aycock, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 658</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 895</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Lapse of time is an important element of laches; yet, unless a case falls within the operation of a statute of limitations, there is no fixed period within which a person must assert his claim or be barred by laches; the length of time depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Cooper v. Aycock, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 658</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 895</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The period from which laches is determined is fixed in equity cases according to the circumstances of each case.
       
       Bryan v. Willingham-Little Stone Co., <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 563</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 40</cite> (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The doctrine of laches not only forbids relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the right, but also authorizes equity to interpose an equitable bar, whenever, from the lapse of time and laches of the complainant, it would be inequitable to allow a party to enforce his legal rights. Goodwin v. First Baptist Church, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 448</cite>, <cite class="app_court">169 S.E.2d 334</cite> (1969), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 524</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E.2d 868</cite> (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In an equitable suit to obtain possession of lands, under a rule analogous to the rule of law permitting title by adverse possession to be acquired in seven years under color of title, claimants would be barred after such time by their laches. Slade v. Barber, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 405</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       On an equitable petition seeking merely a cancellation of a deed, although "equity follows the analogy of the law" in allowing the seven-year period of limitation, this time is permitted only if there are no special circumstances demanding an earlier application, and where such circumstances exist, calling for an interposition of the equitable doctrine of laches, equity will refuse relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of the truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the right. Stephens v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 537</cite> (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The rules of limitation do not apply if the defendant, or those under whom he claims, has been guilty of a fraud by which the plaintiff shall have been debarred or deterred from his action. In such a case the period of limitation shall run only from the time of the discovery of the fraud, and equity applies a similar rule as to laches. Stephens v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 537</cite> (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The statute of limitations is a statute of repose. When a person is defrauded, and has knowledge of the fraud, he must ask redress,
       
       if at all, within the period of limitation. If he waits for a longer period, he is bound by his laches. Slade v. Barber, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 405</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Fraud, which should have been discovered if usual and reasonable diligence had been exercised, is not a good reply to the statute of limitations. Slade v. Barber, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 405</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1946).

       - A petition is not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the ground of laches on the part of the petitioner, where nothing in the petition authorizes the inference that there was any delay on the petitioner's part, suit being brought within the statute of limitations, which rendered the ascertainment of the truth more difficult, or in any way hindered the defendant city in making its defense. Vickers v. City of Fitzgerald, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 476</cite>, <cite class="app_court">117 S.E.2d 316</cite> (1960), overruled on other grounds, City of Chamblee v.

       - Where the petition affirmatively shows that there has been unusual and unreasonable delay in bringing the action, it is incumbent upon the plaintiffs to show that they were not guilty of laches. Hillis v. Clark, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 604</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 922</cite> (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It is incumbent on the plaintiff, in order to repel the presumption of unreasonable delay, to allege in his petition the impediments to an earlier prosecution of his claim. Parker v. Fisher, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 3</cite>, <cite class="app_court">59 S.E.2d 715</cite> (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where it cannot be said as a matter of law that the plaintiff was dilatory in asserting his claim, then the defense of laches is a question for the jury and summary judgment cannot be granted the defendant on the issue.

       <p>

       - Supreme Court of Georgia concluded that case law supporting that a mandamus action can be barred by gross laches is the correct rule; thus, Crow v. McCallum, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 692</cite>, 696 (<cite class="app_court">113 S.E. 203</cite>) (1960), and its progeny, were wrongly decided and overruled. Marsh v. Clarke County Sch.

     <p>

     A court of equity will not lend its aid to a party to a contract founded upon an illegal or immoral consideration;
    
    if the contract is executed, it will be left to stand, and if it be executory, neither party can enforce it. Fender v. Crosby, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 896</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 769</cite> (1953).

    <p>
     <p>
    - The general rule is, that courts will not interfere after verdict at law, except in cases of fraud, or surprise, or in extraordinary cases where manifest injustice would be done; nor where the party might have defended himself fully at law and neglected it. Poole v. McEntire, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 659</cite>, <cite class="app_court">75 S.E.2d 20</cite> (1953).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     A person is generally committed to the contents of an instrument which he signs, even though he did not have actual knowledge thereof,
    
    in the absence of fraud or some other circumstances relieving him of the imputation of inexcusable indifference or neglect. Bach v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 308</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 407</cite> (1946).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Absence of counsel, when caused by illness may be sufficient ground to set aside a judgment.
    
    Clark v. Ramsay, <cite class="ga_court">138 Ga. 726</cite>, <cite class="app_court">75 S.E. 1128</cite> (1912).

     The general rule that an infant is bound by a judgment rendered in a suit in which he is represented by a next friend,
    
    to the same extent as though he were an adult, is subject to an exception in case of fraud, collusion, or like conduct on the part of the next friend, in which case the judgment may be set aside at the instance of the minor, even though it may be a consent judgment. Nelson v. Estill, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1940).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    A decree adversely affecting the interests of minors, even though it be entered by consent of their father as next friend, may, if induced by fraud, duress, or the like, be set aside at their instance in a proper proceeding, and for that purpose they may sue by their mother as next friend. Nelson v. Estill, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1940).

     Before equity will interfere to grant relief against a judgment at law, three things must concur:
    
    ignorance of the defense sought to be set up at the time the judgment at law was rendered, without negligence being imputable to the complainant, and a want of adequate relief at law. Beddingfield v. Old Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 172</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 61</cite> (1932).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     There is no relief from a judgment that could have been prevented but for the negligence of the party.
    
    Beddingfield v. Old Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 172</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 61</cite> (1932).
    </p>
    <h5 class="lalign">
     <b>
      Equity will not reward negligence.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Where a defendant in a pending lawsuit negligently fails to make his defense, equity will not intervene to grant him any relief from a judgment obtained against him in consequence of his negligence. West v. Downer, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">127 S.E.2d 359</cite> (1962); Stratton v. Bingham, <cite class="ga_court">238 Ga. 287</cite>, <cite class="app_court">232 S.E.2d 560</cite> (1977).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    When a party moving to set aside a judgment, during the term it was rendered, has been legally served with the suit and does not show that an alleged fraud practiced on him by the defendant prevented him from making his defense and having his day in court, it is beyond a court's power to grant the motion. Hirsch v. Collier, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 271</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    Equity will not intervene to set aside a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, which might have been prevented except for the negligence of the complaining party. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Seagraves, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 459</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 167</cite> (1934).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    If a party has a good defense at law, and from negligence fails to set it up at the proper time, he must take the consequences of his own laches; he cannot go into equity to be relieved from the consequences of such negligence. Peacock v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 628</cite>, <cite class="app_court">100 S.E.2d 575</cite> (1957).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    The judgment probating a will in solemn form cannot be set aside on any ground which by due diligence could have been ascertained and pleaded as a defense against probate. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 799</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 524</cite> (1969).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    As qualification of the rule controlling the setting aside of judgments or prerequisites to its exercise it must appear that it was not due to defendant's negligence that the fraud was perpetrated, and that due diligence would not have prevented the fraud. Hirsch v. Collier, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 271</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1961), later appeal, <cite class="ga_app_court">106 Ga. App. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">127 S.E.2d 859</cite> (1962).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    To authorize setting aside a judgment after the term at which it was rendered, the actions of the adverse party that cause a party's failure to appear and defend must be of such character to show that reliance on them did not amount to laches or negligence. Hirsch v. Collier, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 271</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1961), later appeal, <cite class="ga_app_court">106 Ga. App. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">127 S.E.2d 859</cite> (1962).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    The failure of a defendant to attend and defend a suit against him cannot be relieved in equity upon the ground that he was advised by his attorney that the case would not be tried until a later term, where it is merely shown that such advice was based upon an incorrect and unwarranted assumption that the remainder of the term would be devoted to the trial of criminal cases. In such a case the erroneous assumption on the part of the attorney would be imputable to the client, and would afford no equitable ground for excusing his absence. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Seagraves, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 459</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 167</cite> (1934).

    Where an administrator was sued upon an instrument alleged to have been executed by his intestate, and he did not know the instrument to be genuine, he should have exercised diligence to determine this fact before permitting judgment against him, and, where he knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the instrument would be introduced in evidence at the trial upon another defense which he had filed, when he would have a sufficient opportunity to discover the truth as to its genuineness, and he failed to avail himself of this opportunity and was absent from the trial only because of an unwarranted assumption by his attorney as to the time when the case would be tried, with the result that judgment was rendered against him, he cannot obtain the aid of a court of equity to set aside the judgment upon the ground that the instrument was a forgery and that he was ignorant of this defense at the time the judgment was rendered. In such case the failure to discover the defense before judgment cannot be accounted as an accident or misfortune, but is chargeable to the defendant as negligence, barring any claim for relief in equity.

    Where a wife voluntarily signed an acknowledgment of service and waiver of process with respect to a suit for divorce that was later to be prepared and filed against her by her husband, and after having signed such acknowledgment and waiver, left the state and made no investigation whatever as to the contents of the suit, which, as filed sought not only a divorce but also custody of the minor child of the parties, with judgment rendered accordingly as to both matters in favor of the husband, the wife's petition in equity to set aside the judgment showed such negligence on the part of the wife in failing to acquaint herself with the contents of the suit as to bar her right to equitable relief sought, and the court did not err in dismissing the petition despite the wife's allegation that there was a breach of an agreement by the husband that he would not seek custody in the suit.

    In order to set aside an award of the full workmen's compensation board (now Board of Workers' Compensation) which was entered pursuant to an agreement between the parties, because of fraud, accident or mistake, this fraud, accident or mistake is the same as is set forth in this section, and is not available where the person seeking to set aside the award has been guilty of fraud or negligence himself. Where an agreement signed by the claimant which is said to have been procured by fraud stated not only that the claimant did not suffer an injury which arose out of and in the course of her employment, but stated that she was not entitled to any compensation, such language being clear and understandable and it is not alleged that the claimant was prohibited from reading such agreement or that she did not read it, therefore, it must be concluded that the claimant was either negligent in failing to read such agreement or that she was negligent in signing it if some part of it was untrue and she had read it.

    Deceitful practices in depriving or endeavoring to deprive another of his known right by means of some artful device or plan contrary to plain rules of common honesty constitute fraud. By this term is meant fraud perpetrated by some artifice or contrivance of the party or person benefited, whereby in the course of the trial, or in entering judgment, the injured party or the court has been imposed upon or betrayed into inattention or deceived.

    - To set aside an award for fraud, it is not sufficient to state the fraud in general terms, but such facts of fraud must be so stated that the court may see the illegality. Tinsley v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 471</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 297</cite> (1933).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    When a party moving to set aside a judgment, during the term it was rendered, has been legally served with the suit and does not show that an alleged fraud practiced on him by the defendant prevented him from making his defense and having his day in court, it is beyond a court's power to grant the motion. Hirsch v. Collier, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 271</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    While a court of equity in a proper case will set aside a judgment which is procured by fraud, such fraud must be one other than false and untrue testimony. Hutchings v. Roquemore, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 359</cite>, <cite class="app_court">155 S.E. 675</cite> (1930).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Fraud authorizing setting aside a judgment must come from the adverse party.
    
    Tinsley v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 471</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 297</cite> (1933).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    While a court of equity has authority to annul and set aside a judgment obtained by fraud, accident or mistake, it must be made to appear in an action therefor, where fraud is claimed, that the fraud was perpetrated by the adverse party, his counsel or agent. Pike v. Andrews, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 553</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 817</cite> (1954).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Fraud that will authorize equity to set aside an award is fraud extrinsic or collateral
    
    to the matter tried by the first court, and not a fraud which was in issue in that suit; or it must be fraud or deception practiced on the unsuccessful party, by which he was prevented from exhibiting fully his case, and by which there has never been a real contest before court on the subject matter of the suit. Tinsley v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 471</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 297</cite> (1933); Pike v. Andrews, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 553</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 817</cite> (1954).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    Before fraud will authorize a court of equity to vacate and set aside a judgment of a court having jurisdiction, it must appear that the fraud complained of was perpetrated by the prevailing party, his attorney or his agents. Poole v. McEntire, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 659</cite>, <cite class="app_court">75 S.E.2d 20</cite> (1953); Pike v. Andrews, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 553</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 817</cite> (1954).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     The frauds for which the court may set aside a former judgment between the same parties do not include fraud in procuring a judgment by false testimony
    
    unless it is shown, among other things, that the witness has been convicted of perjury. Elliott v. Marshall, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 513</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 831</cite> (1936).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     A court of equity will not set aside a judgment, although obtained by willful and corrupt perjury,
    
    unless it appears that the perjurer has been convicted of such perjury, and unless it appears that a judgment could not have been rendered without the perjured testimony. Hutchings v. Roquemore, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 359</cite>, <cite class="app_court">155 S.E. 675</cite> (1930).

     Misrepresentation is one of the grounds on which equitable relief may be invoked in regard to judgments.

     <p>
    When one party does give the other assurances upon which he can reasonably rely, that the suit will be dismissed or judgment will not be taken, and then procures a judgment taking advantage of the trust and confidence of the other party, the party misled, who is not himself negligent, has a ground to set aside the judgment. Hirsch v. Collier, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 271</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1961), later appeal, <cite class="ga_app_court">106 Ga.

     Two things are required to constitute a meritorious bill in equity to set aside a judgment
    
    rendered in a court having jurisdiction on account of accident, mistake or fraud: first, that the complainant had a good defense to the action at law; and secondly, that the failure to make that defense there was owing, not to any negligence or fault in the complainant, but to fault of the defendants or their attorney. Russell v. Hoge, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 814</cite>, <cite class="app_court">125 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1962).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    In equitable proceedings to set aside a judgment rendered in a court of law on account of accident, mistake, or fraud, the plaintiff is required to set out a meritorious defense to the action in which he seeks to set aside the judgment. This does not mean that, in a direct equitable proceeding to set aside a judgment of a court of ordinary or a court of law on the ground that such court or courts had no jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the person, and that said judgment is void, it is necessary to plead a meritorious defense. Foster v. Foster, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 519</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 318</cite> (1951).

    A judgment obtained against an executor cannot be set aside in equity by legatees on ground that there was a good defense which executor failed to set up, unless it be also shown that there was accident, mistake, fraud, or corrupt complicity between executor and plaintiff. Tinsley v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 471</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 297</cite> (1933).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
    To have a judgment set aside, a plaintiff must have a good defense of which he was entirely ignorant, or he must be prevented from making the defense because of fraud or accident, or the act of the adverse party, unmixed with fraud or negligence on his own part. The allegation that the plaintiff had no notice that he was being sued is not sufficient ground to set aside the judgment, the opposite party having complied with the law as to service. Milam v. Busey, <cite class="ga_app_court">96 Ga. App. 88</cite>, <cite class="app_court">99 S.E.2d 325</cite> (1957).

       - Before it is applicable, this section requires great inadequacy of consideration joined with great disparity of mental ability. It follows, therefore, that both must exist. Bailey v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 395</cite>, <cite class="app_court">110 S.E.2d 673</cite> (1959).

        Under the principle enunciated in this section, a deed may be set aside in equity, on proof of the two elements stated
       
       (in this section), without proof of anything else as to fraud. Sutton v. McMillan, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 139</cite> (1957); Titshaw v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Generally, this section is applied in those instances where great mental disparity is relied upon by one of the parties to the contract. Moore v. Wells, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 446</cite>, <cite class="app_court">93 S.E.2d 731</cite> (1956).

       Want of consideration for a conveyance, coupled with mental weakness or old age and undue influence, will authorize equitable relief
      
      under this section. Harden v. Weaver, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 384</cite> (1937).

      "Great inadequacy of consideration, joined with great disparity of mental ability in contracting a bargain, may justify equity in setting aside a sale or other contract." Under that principle, a deed may be set aside in equity, on proof of the two elements stated, "without proof of anything else" as to fraud. A fortiori, the same rule would apply with at least equal force in case of such mental disparity and a total absence of consideration. Stow v. Hargrove, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 454</cite> (1948).

       - Where, in a wrongful death action, a railroad argued there was no evidence presented to show a disparate mental ability between anyone representing the railroad on the one hand and the plaintiffs on the other at the time of their signing of a contract of release, but plaintiffs showed that they were in a highly emotional state following the death of their son and that treatment for their stress included valium, and a psychologist, who tested the plaintiffs found their I.Q. levels to be in the "mentally defective" range, while the railroad agent involved, on the other hand, was college educated and had some 20 years' experience in claims investigation and settlement, under the "any evidence" standard, the railroad was not entitled to a directed verdict.

       - As between the original parties thereto, fraud in its procurement voids a contract, and this upon the theory that, the consent of the parties being necessary to the binding force of a contract, if one, apparently consenting by the execution of a written contract, can show that he did not in fact consent to its terms as therein expressed, but that his apparent consent was induced by false and fraudulent practices, by means of which he was overreached by the other party, and, without negligence upon his own part, really deceived as to the terms of the contract, he would be entitled to be relieved from its apparent obligations. McKaig v. Hardy, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 11</cite> (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where the grantor of an "improvident or profuse" deed was not wholly incapable of entering into such a contract, but was possessed of little or no will power and was greatly under the influence of the nephew to whom the deed was executed, an inference of fraud could have been drawn by the jury, and, the evidence for the defendant grantee not being such as to rebut the inference as a matter of law, the court was authorized to charge the jury upon the subject of fraud.

       As against one who by fraud during the lifetime of deceased husband induced the latter to execute to him a deed to realty, equity will afford the widow, as personal representative, a remedy to cancel and set aside the deed and incidentally to preserve and apply rents issuing from such realty.

       - In action for cancellation or rescission of deed, the mere statement that the plaintiff was "almost crazy with grief over the recent death of her son" shows neither a mental incapacity to execute the instrument nor a "great disparity of mental ability" between the parties, such as would authorize the interference of equity on account of a "great inadequacy" of consideration, even if a "great inadequacy" had been sufficiently alleged.

       Where a party at the time of entering into a contract or executing an instrument is intoxicated
      
      to such a degree as to deprive him of his reason and to disqualify his mind to apprehend the nature of his act and its probable consequences, a court of equity may grant relief by rescission and cancellation. Equity will grant relief where the transfer of a valuable property has been fraudulently extorted, for a grossly inadequate consideration, from a person while in such a state of intoxication as to render him incapable of transacting business.

       An accident in its strict sense implies the absence of negligence for which no one would be liable.

       In its proper use the term accident excludes negligence;
      
      that is, an accident is an event which occurs without the fault, carelessness, or want of proper circumspection of the person affected, or which could not have been avoided by the use of that kind and degree of care necessary to the exigency and in the circumstances in which he was placed.

       A mistake, either of law or fact, is cognizable in equity and affords a remedy therein by reformation
      
      of the instrument so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, on a proper cause being made; but such a jurisdiction will always be cautiously exercised, and to justify it the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive. Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 693</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 534</cite> (1946); Prince v. Friedman, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 136</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 434</cite> (1947).

      Reformation as applied to a contract is remedy cognizable in equity for the purpose of correcting an instrument so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, where from some cause, such as fraud, accident, or mistake it does not express such intention. The remedy is not available for the purpose of making a new and different contract for the parties, but is confined to establishment of the actual agreement. Deck v. Shields, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 697</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 514</cite> (1943).

         Mistake defined.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Mistake, within the meaning of equity, is an erroneous mental condition, conception, or conviction, induced by ignorance, misapprehension, or misunderstanding of the truth, but without negligence and resulting in some act or omission done or suffered erroneously by one or both of the parties to a transaction, but without its erroneous character being intended or known at the time. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 831</cite> (1937); Whipple v. County of Houston, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 532</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Mistake is internal; it is a mental condition, a conception, a conviction of the understanding; erroneous indeed, but nonetheless a conviction which influences the will and leads to some outward physical manifestation. Its operation is ordinarily, though not always, affirmative the doing of some act which would not have been done in the absence of the particular conception or conviction which influenced the free action of the will. Its essential requisite is ignorance. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 831</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The essential element of a mistake is a mental condition or conception or conviction of the understanding. This mental condition may be either a passive state or an active conviction. When merely passive, it may consist of an unconsciousness, an ignorance, or a forgetfulness; when active, it must be a belief. In the first of these two conditions, the unconsciousness, ignorance, or forgetfulness may be either of a fact which is present and now existing, or of a fact which is past and has existed; they must always concern a fact material to the transaction. In the second condition, the belief may be either that a certain matter or thing exists at the present time which really does not exist; or that certain matter or thing existed at some time which did not really exist. All possible forms of mistake of fact are embraced within this description; and all particular errors which fall under any of these conditions are mistakes of fact which furnish an occasion for equitable relief. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 831</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Mistake of fact is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake,
       
       and consisting in, an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract; or belief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract which does not exist, or in the past existence of such a thing which has not existed. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 831</cite> (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Mistake is distinguished from fraud, fraudulent representations, or fraudulent concealments,
       
       by the absence of knowledge and intention, which in legal fraud are actually present, and in constructive fraud are theoretically present, as necessary elements. It is also distinguished from that inattention or absence of thought which are inherent in negligence. The erroneous conception or conviction of the understanding which constitutes the equitable notion of mistake has nothing in common with negligence; equity will not relieve a person from his erroneous acts or omissions resulting from his own negligence. Callan Court Co. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 831</cite> (1937).

       - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the borrowers on the bank's claim for equitable reformation of the security deeds because evidence included the fact that a portion of the 2003 loan paid off a joint debt previously secured by the property and the borrowers subsequently represented to the bankruptcy court that the debt secured by the property was jointly owed, which created a question of fact as to whether the debt was secured by the real property at issue.

       - In an action seeking reformation of a lease agreement to include an option to purchase, the trial court properly granted the defendant's motion for directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff's evidence, where there was no evidence of mutual mistake, there was likewise no evidence of fraud or inequitable conduct in the record, it was undisputed that plaintiff did not read the lease agreement until months after he signed it, and the record did not demonstrate that a confidential relationship existed between the parties, but rather showed that they were friends engaged in an arms' length transaction.

       Equity will not reform a contract on the ground of mistake,
      
      unless it be a mutual one or unless there be a mistake on one side and fraud on the other. Rawson v. Brosnan, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 624</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 423</cite> (1939); Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins.

      <p>
       <p>
      Equity will not decree the reformation of an instrument because of mistake of one of the parties alone unmixed with any fraud or knowledge on the part of the other equivalent to mutual mistake. For a mistake to be relievable in equity by reformation, it must be mutual, or else mistake on the part of one to the contract and fraud on the part of the other. Yablon v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 693</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 534</cite> (1946); Prince v.

      <p>
       <p>
      A court of equity will reform a contract of sale when, from mutual mistake or mistake common to both parties, an instrument does not express the true agreement of the parties. Equity will also reform an instrument where there is mistake on one side, and fraud or inequitable conduct on the other. Prince v. Friedman, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 136</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 434</cite> (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      To enable a court to reform an agreement evidenced by writing on the ground of mistake, it must affirmatively appear that the mistake was common to both parties, and that the writing, as executed, expresses the contract as understood by both parties. Prince v. Friedman, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 136</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 434</cite> (1947).

       <p>
      If a writing has been executed with a view of obtaining a particular object, and by mistake it has been so drawn as not to have the contemplated operations at law, chancery (now equity) will reform the instrument, so that it will fulfill the intention of the parties. Agreements, whether executed or executory, within or without the statute of frauds, whether for the conveyance of real or personal property, will be reformed by courts of equity, on the ground of mistake. Head v. Stephens, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 184</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 772</cite> (1959), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 191</cite>, <cite class="app_court">126 S.E.2d 623</cite> (1962).

      "An honest mistake of the law as to the effect of an instrument on the part of both contracting parties, when such mistake operates as a gross injustice to one, and gives an unconscientious advantage to the other, may be relieved in equity."

      The rule is well settled that a simple mistake by a party as to the legal effect of an agreement which he executes, or as to the legal result of an act which he performs, is no ground for either defensive or affirmative relief.

      Where, due to a mistake of fact unmixed with negligence, the condemnation proceeding for a public road was conducted throughout upon the theory that the road would be paved at approximately grade level, thus improving rather than damaging the remaining abutting property, and there was nothing to indicate that a fill of from 25 to 40 feet would be made in front of the remaining property which would damage it in the amount of approximately $20,000.00, a petition in equity, alleging these facts and alleging that the mistake prevented the owners from proving this consequential damage, alleged a cause of action to set aside the award and the judgment of condemnation and to recover the full damages.

      Because the plaintiff had opportunity to examine a second written tolling agreement before he executed it, and because there was no suggestion that the alleged mistake in the agreement was anything other than a unilateral mistake on the part of the plaintiff, the plaintiff's own negligence resulted in there being no basis for reforming the parties' second written tolling agreement.

       - In some jurisdictions it is held that the mistake of a draftsman or scrivener, acting by direction of only one of the parties, is a unilateral mistake, and is one which will not warrant reformation.

       - A mere failure of an insured to read his policy of insurance does not amount to such laches as will debar him from having such policy reformed for mistake therein. A policy of insurance is issued by the insurer and signed by him or his agent. It is not contemplated that the insured shall sign it. In the insurer's promise to deliver an accurate policy, according to his oral agreement with the insured, the insured has a just expectation that there will be no designed variance.

         Grounds of mistake must be fully alleged.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When a defendant, in a court of law, seeks to avoid his contract on the ground of mistake, he must, by his pleadings, allege the grounds of the mistake, as fully as he is required to do in a court of equity to entitle him to relief. Hargrove v. Bledsoe, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga. App. 107</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 223</cite> (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The rules of pleading in this state require that allegations of mistake should be set forth with considerable definiteness and certainty,
       
       and that such general allegations as that certain matters were left out of or included in the contract as written "by mutual mistake of the parties" are not sufficient. Wheeler v. Poole, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 477</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1948).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - To authorize a verdict reforming a deed upon the ground of mutual mistake, the evidence, like the petition, should at least by inference show the particular mistake and illustrate how it occurred; and the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive as to the mistake. Helton v. Shellnut, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 185</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 287</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where the court did charge in language identical to that of this section, it is not subject to the criticism that it erred in its charge to the jury that they must decide the question of mistake by a preponderance of the testimony, whereas the law provides that the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive as to the mistake. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. State Hwy. Dep't, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 443</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E. 174</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It was error for the court to instruct the jury that the party seeking reformation of the description in a deed could establish his right thereto by a preponderance of the evidence only. Carroll v. Craig, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 257</cite>, <cite class="app_court">104 S.E.2d 215</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a diversity based suit in equity to set aside or deny res judicata effect to a prior state court judgment on the grounds of fraud and mutual mistake, the plaintiffs had to prove their claims by something more than a mere preponderance of the evidence. The evidence had to preponderate in the plaintiffs' favor, but it also had to be of "clear, unequivocal, and decisive" quality. Ahrens v. Katz, 595 F. Supp. 1108 (N.D. Ga. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In an action seeking cancellation of a warranty deed to a trustee, the beneficiary's testimony that he could not remember the execution of the deed did not demand a finding that the deed should be cancelled on the ground of legal mistake. Ivey v. Ivey, <cite class="ga_court">266 Ga. 143</cite>, <cite class="app_court">465 S.E.2d 434</cite> (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court would not construe an agreement and a deed together as creating a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent because a month-long gap between the execution of the agreement and the deed was too great of a gap in time to deem the documents as being executed contemporaneously. Nor would the court reform the documents to do so as the creditor failed to demonstrate a mistake of present or past fact relievable in equity, either by rescission or reformation. Kelley v. McCormack (In re Mitchell), 548 Bankr. 862 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2016).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Before decreeing reformation, a court requires that the parol evidence of a mistake and of an alleged modification of a contract must be most clear and convincing. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 176</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 588</cite> (1978).

        <p>
       In a suit for reformation of contract based upon alleged mutual mistake, the parol evidence rule does not bar introduction of testimony as to the oral agreement reached by the parties which the writing was intended to reflect. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 176</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 588</cite> (1978).

       Where petition alleges that parties to a deed orally agreed that the consideration was to be $850.00 cash for the plaintiff's equity and that the defendants were to assume and pay certain loans on the property, and that, due to a mutual mistake of law as to the effect of a recital of a nominal consideration in a deed, the deed fails to state the true consideration agreed upon by the parties, the fact that the agreement is not in writing will not bar a recovery, since what is sought to be enforced is not an oral agreement barred by the statute of frauds, but to reduce to writing the true agreement between the parties to prevent an unconscionable advantage to one of the parties to a contract. Head v. Stephens, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 184</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 772</cite> (1959), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 191</cite>, <cite class="app_court">126 S.E.2d 623</cite> (1962).

        A docketing error made in the clerk's office amounts to an accident or mistake relievable in equity

       - Despite a payee's argument that a reformation claim could not have previously been filed because neither party foresaw that a contract claim could have been disposed of as it was, that argument was rejected as spurious, and because this argument ignored the fact that the payee filed a prior quantum meruit claim, which was predicated on the lack of an enforceable contract; hence, the payor obviously anticipated that the contract might not be entirely enforceable, and having done so, could have recognized the need to bring a reformation claim in the earlier action.

       - Although equity will not reform a written contract because of mistake as to the contents of the writing on the part of the complaining party, who is able to read but fails to do so, where no sufficient excuse appears as to why such party did not read the contract, such principle has not been extended to cases in which it is sought to reform written instruments on the ground of mutual mistake of fact.

       Even where money is paid under a mistake of fact or in ignorance of facts, it cannot be recovered, unless the circumstances are such that the party receiving it ought not, in equity and good conscience, to be allowed to retain it. The expression, "in equity and good conscience," refers only to the acts and intentions of the person receiving the money as affecting the other party to the transaction. If he has acted in good faith and in good conscience with the person paying the money, he is entitled to retain it, even if his actions and intentions may not have been in good faith and in good conscience as regards other persons not connected with the transaction.

       Where, due to a mistake of fact unmixed with negligence, the condemnation proceeding for a public road was conducted throughout upon the theory that the road would be paved at approximately grade level, thus improving rather than damaging the remaining abutting property, and there was nothing to indicate that a fill of from 25 to 40 feet would be made in front of the remaining property which would damage it in the amount of approximately $20,000.00, a petition in equity, alleging these facts and alleging that the mistake prevented the owners from proving this consequential damage, alleged a cause of action to set aside the award and the judgment of condemnation and to recover the full damages.

       A contractor who has bid for the excavation of highway sites on a basis of "unclassified material" may not, under the guise of mistake of fact, seek additional compensation in an action at law because the material excavated contained a higher percentage of rock than it expected, even though its only information at the time of the bid was results of test borings made available to it by the highway department (now Department of Transportation), where it was specifically stipulated that the data were not guaranteed and did not bind the department; where the department furnished all information which it had available, made no attempt to conceal actual conditions, and stipulated the provisional character of its tests, where the contractor had equal opportunity with the department to conduct its own investigation, and where the parties with knowledge of these facts elected to contract on a basis of material moved rather than to contract on a basis of the percentage of dirt and rock after removal.

       Where a deed fixes the northern boundary of a tract of land as a certain public road, the legal effect of such description, in the absence of a contrary intention being manifested in the instrument, is that the road open and actually in use by the public is the road intended by the parties, rather than the site of an old road, and the language, being unambiguous, cannot be aided by extrinsic evidence to extend the boundary to the old-road site, the sole remedy for such purpose being reformation of the deed.

       - A mistake, either of law or fact, is cognizable in equity and affords a remedy therein by reformation of the instrument so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, on a proper cause being made; but such a jurisdiction will always be cautiously exercised, and to justify it the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive.

       Reformation as applied to a contract is a remedy cognizable in equity for the purpose of correcting an instrument
      
      so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, where from some cause, such as fraud, accident, or mistake it does not express such intention. The remedy is not available for the purpose of making a new and different contract for the parties, but is confined to establishment of the actual agreement. Deck v. Shields, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 697</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 514</cite> (1943).

      An IRS objection to the proposed reformation of certain deeds to reflect that all parties to the transfer of a Georgia nursing home had intended an omitted tract to be included within the description was rejected despite the IRS's insistence that a lien filed pursuant to 26 U.S.C.
   §
   6321 was effective to encumber the omitted tract because all criteria for reformation pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c02s23-2-25" target="_self">23-2-25</a></cite> were met. Nat'l Assistance Bureau, Inc. v. Macon Mem'l Intermediate Care Home, Inc.,

       Where the form of the conveyance or instrument is, by mutual mistake, contrary to the intention of the parties equity will interfere
      
      to make it conform thereto. In such cases, it is wholly immaterial from what cause the defective execution of the intent of the parties originated. Hill v. Agnew, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 702</cite> (1945); Sheldon v. Hargrose, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 672</cite>, <cite class="app_court">100 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1957).

      Where personal property is sold, and a bill of sale with warranty of title is executed by the vendor, and the property is again sold with warranty of title, the last vendee and his vendor may join in an equitable petition against the original vendor, having for its purpose the reformation of the original bill of sale by including certain items of property omitted therefrom by mutual mistake. Chapman v. Cassels Co., <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 349</cite>, <cite class="app_court">179 S.E. 91</cite> (1935).

      Where the plaintiffs sued as remaindermen to recover undivided interests in land after death of the life tenant, relying on a deed which by its terms plainly vested in them the remainder interest claimed, and the defendant contended that the deed had been so reformed by an equitable decree for reformation of the deed, rendered 50 years earlier, as to vest the fee-simple title in the person originally named as life tenant, from whom he purchased, the so-called decree of reformation was void, for the reason that it was based upon a petition that did not state a cause of action for reformation, and did not contain enough to amend by as related to such relief, therefore the evidence demanded a verdict for the plaintiffs. Deck v. Shields, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 697</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 514</cite> (1943).

Martin v. Oakhurst Dev. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 288</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 179</cite> (1944).

       - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the borrowers on the bank's claim for equitable reformation of the security deeds because evidence included the fact that a portion of the 2003 loan paid off a joint debt previously secured by the property and the borrowers subsequently represented to the bankruptcy court that the debt secured by the property was jointly owed, which created a question of fact as to whether the debt was secured by the real property at issue.

        - Creditor could not prevail on the creditor's claim for equitable reformation of a security deed executed by a debtor that did not own the property because nothing in the chain of title provided constructive notice to a potential purchaser of the property of the creditor's equitable interest in the property. Stearns Bank, N.A. v. Rent-A-Tent, Inc. (In re Rent A Tent, Inc.), 468 Bankr. 442 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court would not construe an agreement and a deed together as creating a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent because a month-long gap between the execution of the agreement and the deed was too great of a gap in time to deem the documents as being executed contemporaneously. Nor would the court reform the documents to do so as the creditor failed to demonstrate a mistake of present or past fact relievable in equity, either by rescission or reformation. Kelley v. McCormack (In re Mitchell), 548 Bankr. 862 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2016).

       <p>
        Taking as true for purposes of a Chapter 7 trustee's motion for judgment on the pleadings a bank's contention that the parties involved in the sale, financing, and purchase of the property at issue intended that the property be conveyed to the debtor wife alone and intended that the security deed encumber the entire property rather than only an undivided one-half interest, the bank was not entitled to reformation of a special warranty deed (SWD) under Georgia law because as a security deed grantee, it was not an original party to the SWD or in privity with any party to the SWD.

        - Creditor prevailed on the creditor's claim for equitable reformation of a security deed executed by a debtor that did not own the property because a later modification of the deed was filed and was within the chain of title for the property, providing any potential purchaser of the property constructive notice of the creditor's equitable interest in the property. Stearns Bank, N.A. v. Rent-A-Tent, Inc. (In re Rent A Tent, Inc.), 468 Bankr. 442 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reformation was appropriate under Georgia law as it was clear that both a Chapter 13 debtor and a bank intended the legal description in a security deed to include tract two only, and that a mutual mistake occurred due to a scrivener's error. There was no prejudice to the debtor as the trustee required the debtor to propose a Chapter 13 plan as though the deed had been reformed; further, prejudice due to the loss of debtor's house was not grounds to deny reformation as the debtor contracted and intended to pledge tract two as collateral, the debtor had the use of the loan proceeds, and the debtor used funds to satisfy an earlier debt on the tract. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Thompson (In re Thompson), 499 Bankr. 908 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the bank as to the bank's claim for reformation to include a mistakenly omitted signature on the security deed as the borrowers had not suffered prejudice where the borrowers received a loan and used part of that loan to satisfy an earlier loan from another lender relating to the property, and the borrowers failed to show that the borrowers would suffer any prejudice if the deed were reformed. Vibert v. Bank of America, N.A., <cite class="ga_app_court">327 Ga. App. 782</cite>, <cite class="app_court">761 S.E.2d 162</cite> (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy court did not commit clear error in reforming a security deed and cancelling a quitclaim deed due to the parties' mutual mistake because the undisputed facts showed that the Chapter 13 debtor and the lender intended for the security deed's legal description to include one tract and not three tracts. Thompson v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. (In re Thompson),
   F. Supp. 2d
   (S.D. Ga. Aug. 11, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Lenders were entitled to equitable reformation as the evidence demonstrated that the parties had earlier attempted to modify the security deed to include both parcels in the legal description attached to the security deed and to establish both parcels as security for the subject loan.

       This section has no application to a mutual mistake of law

      Because a mutual mistake of law was not a valid reason to nullify the parties' choice of Delaware law in order to uphold a right of first refusal, the parties' settlement agreement was not subject to reformation due to an alleged mutual mistake. Thus, under Delaware law, the right was properly declared invalid under the rule against perpetuities. CS-Lakeview at Gwinnett, Inc. v. Simon Prop. Group, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">283 Ga. 426</cite>, <cite class="app_court">659 S.E.2d 359</cite> (2008).

       - Equity has jurisdiction to reform a written instrument where there has been ignorance or mistake on the part of one of the parties, accompanied by fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of the other party. Wellborn v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 389</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 16</cite> (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If the fraud or inequitable conduct complained of consists of an alleged misrepresentation of fact, it is immaterial whether the party making the misrepresentation knows it to be false or not; it is nonetheless fraud in law, even though not fraud in fact. Wellborn v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 389</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 16</cite> (1948).

        <p>
       A simple mistake by a party as to the legal effect of an agreement which he executes, or as to the legal result of an act which he performs, is no ground for either defensive or affirmative relief.

        <p>
       - Any possible violation of a fiduciary bond which remained between a city and a law firm as a result of a prior attorney-client relationship provided no basis for reforming an amended lease because there was no indication that the law firm was a party to its attorney's alleged duplicity and there was no proof in the record of any occurrence which prevented the city from reading the amended lease prior to executing the document. City of College Park v. Sheraton Savannah Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">235 Ga. App. 561</cite>, <cite class="app_court">509 S.E.2d 371</cite> (1998).

        An insurer was entitled to reformation of a policy
       
       where coverage of a vehicle was extended at the insured's request, after the vehicle was involved in an accident; even though the insurer could have inquired before extending the coverage, the insured was not prejudiced by the insurer's action and would obtain a windfall absent reformation of the contract.

Because the dollar amount of the high bid at the foreclosure sale alone made it immediately apparent that there had been a mistake, a reasonable inference arose that had reasonable diligence been employed before the foreclosure sale, the alleged unilateral mistake would not have occurred.

      While equity will, on reasonable application, and under proper circumstances, relieve a party from the injurious consequences of an act done under a mistake of fact, it will not do so if such party could, by reasonable diligence, have ascertained the truth as to the matter concerning which the mistake was made.

      A contractor who has bid for the excavation of highway sites on a basis of "unclassified material" may not, under the guise of mistake of fact, seek additional compensation in an action at law because the material excavated contained a higher percentage of rock than it expected, even though its only information at the time of the bid was results of test borings made available to it by the highway department (now Department of Transportation), where it was specifically stipulated that the data were not guaranteed and did not bind the department; where the department furnished all information which it had available, made no attempt to conceal actual conditions, and stipulated the provisional character of its tests, where the contractor had equal opportunity with the department to conduct its own investigation, and where the parties with knowledge of these facts elected to contract on a basis of material moved rather than to contract on a basis of the percentage of dirt and rock after removal.

      Materialmen are charged with knowledge of the premises upon which they filed their claim of lien, with knowledge of the premises to which they delivered the materials, and where they knew that these premises differed, in plenty of time to properly record a claim of lien as required by law, they cannot seek the aid of a court of equity to relieve them from their own negligence.

      Plaintiff's petition to cancel and declare void her acknowledgement of service and to set aside the judgment probating a will on the alleged ground of fraud failed to state a cause of action for the relief sought, since the plaintiff by an exercise of the slightest degree of diligence could have ascertained and asserted in the probate proceeding the falsity of the act upon which she relied to set aside the probate judgment.

      Where the terms of an instrument express the intent of the parties at the time the contract is made, as they are then informed, in the absence of any allegation of fraud, misrepresentation, or misplaced confidence, equity will not interfere to relieve on account of ignorance of a fact by one of the parties, if by the exercise of due diligence he might have ascertained the truth.

      While the doctrine of caveat emptor would charge the purchaser with looking out for the title which the seller had to the tract offered for sale as his, it would not charge him with looking out for the boundaries of that tract when the seller undertook to locate and point them out, thus professing to know them sufficiently to enable them to furnish this information to purchasers instead of leaving the latter to their own resources in acquiring the information.

      Because there was no fraud that prevented siblings from reading a deed presented to them by their brother, which he allegedly represented as an easement, and no fiduciary relationship upon which they could have justifiably relied, the siblings should have discovered the alleged fraud when they signed the deed, and the seven-year statute of limitations expired seven years later.

       One about to sign a written instrument cannot rely blindly upon the representations of other parties as to its contents,
      
      and if, without an emergency or fraud inducing him not to read it, he signs without reading, he cannot hold the other party responsible for his statements, though they be false. Livingston v. Barnett, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1942).

      Where one, while negotiating for the purchase of realty, has an opportunity to examine it before agreeing to buy, but fails to do so and voluntarily relies on statements made by the seller concerning its character and value, a written contract to sell and purchase the property subsequently executed by the contracting parties will not, on petition therefor by the purchaser, be rescinded and set aside because of the falsity of such statements, unless some fraud or artifice was practiced by the seller to prevent such examination by the purchaser; and this is true although the purchaser in agreeing to buy relied upon the seller's representations as to the character and value of the property as being true, and in consequence of such reliance acted to his injury. Tingle v. Seignious, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 71</cite>, <cite class="app_court">90 S.E.2d 408</cite> (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Any representation, act, or artifice intended to deceive, and which does deceive another, is such a fraud as may authorize cancellation of a written contract, but a party to a contract who can read must read or show a legal excuse for not doing so, and ordinarily, if fraud is the excuse, it must be such fraud as prevents the party from reading; nor in such case will a mere fraudulent statement by the opposite party or his agent as to the contents of the writing furnish a legal excuse. And where the contract is a deed to land, the rule will generally apply to the grantee as well as the grantor. Livingston v. Barnett, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1942).

      Where two contracting parties deal with each other at arms' length and on equal terms, and where there is no such confidential relation between them as to justify special confidence reposed by one in the other, a written instrument entered into between them cannot be set aside upon the ground that the party seeking to be relieved was induced to enter in and sign the instrument in consequence of fraudulent representations as to its contents upon the part of the adverse party, when it appears that the party signing could read, that there was nothing to prevent him from reading the instrument, but that he did not do so, that there was no sufficient excuse for his failing to do so, but he signed after he had full opportunity to inform himself as to the terms of the instrument by reading it, but negligently omitted to read the same, when he could thus have informed himself of its contents. Livingston v. Barnett, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1942).

      Where plaintiff signed a deed which was read to her by an attorney which she did not read herself, and there was no evidence that there were emergency circumstances of disabilities preventing her from reading the deed, the mere fact that the plaintiff signed the deed in a room where the shades were not put up and the blinds were not open, where it does not appear that she could not have raised the shades nor opened the blinds and let in sufficient light by which she could read the deed, is insufficient as an excuse for her not reading the deed and becoming acquainted with its contents before she signed it. McCommons v. Greene County, <cite class="ga_app_court">53 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 897</cite> (1936).

      Equity will grant no relief in favor of one who buys land when he fails to exercise any diligence for his protection and asserts that he blindly relied on the representations of the seller as to matters of which he could have informed himself, and the same is true in the purchase of a stock of merchandise and fixtures. Holmes v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 359</cite> (1951).

       <p>
      While the inability of a plaintiff vendor, in an alleged fraudulent land sale case, to read the English language would be a circumstance which should be considered in determining whether or not he has been defrauded, the fact of such inability is not of itself sufficient to authorize the rescission of a contract. Robertson v. Panlos, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 116</cite>, <cite class="app_court">65 S.E.2d 400</cite> (1951).

       As a general rule, fraud voids all contracts;
      
      however, this rule is not applied in its entirety and without reservation to written contracts, for the reason that misrepresentations and false statements will not be heard in contradiction of the terms of a valid written instrument, unless it should appear that the party signing the same has been induced to sign by a fraud, trickery, artifice, or emergency happening at the time of such signing. Livingston v. Barnett, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1942).

      A distinction exists between reforming a contract and executing a contract in case of mistake. To authorize the former, the court shall be satisfied by the evidence that the mistake was mutual; but the court may refuse to act in the latter case if the mistake is confined to the party refusing to execute.

         Reformation requires mutual mistake.

       - Equity will not reform a written contract on account of a mistake unless the mistake was one of both parties. Some particular mutual mistake and how it occurred must be alleged and plainly shown. Rawson v. Brosnan, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 624</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 423</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Equity in a proper case may reform a written contract because of fraud on one side and mistake on the other; a contract may also be reformed for a mistake of both parties, but the evidence must show that the mistake was mutual. Helton v. Shellnut, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 185</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 287</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A petition for reformation of a written contract will lie where by mistake of the draftsman and by oversight of the parties, the writing does not embody or fully express the real contract of the parties. McLoon v. McLoon, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 18</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E.2d 740</cite> (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Reformation as applied to a contract is a remedy cognizable in equity for the purpose of correcting an instrument so as to make it express the true intention of the parties, where from some cause, such as fraud, accident, or mistake it does not express such intention. The remedy is not available for the purpose of making a new and different contract for the parties, but is confined to establishment of the actual agreement. Deck v. Shields, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 697</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 514</cite> (1943).
       </p>

        <p>
       Although equity will not reform a written contract because of mistake as to the contents of the writing on the part of the complaining party, who is able to read but fails to do so, where no sufficient excuse appears as to why such party did not read the contract, such principle has not been extended to cases in which it is sought to reform written instruments on the ground of mutual mistake of fact. In all cases where the form of the conveyance or instrument is, by mutual mistake, contrary to the intention of the parties in their contract, equity will interfere to make it conform thereto. Eaton Yale &amp; Towne, Inc. v. Strickland, <cite class="ga_court">228 Ga. 430</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E.2d 923</cite> (1971).

       A mistake in reference to the description of land conveyed on the part of one grantee, acting on behalf of other grantees who were absent, is a mistake on the part of all of them; and where the same mistake was made by the grantor, there would be a mistake of all the parties, within the rule as to mutuality. Lifsey v. Mims, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 780</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E.2d 32</cite> (1942).

       The mere failure to discover a conflict between the terms of an oral contract as to what a policy of insurance is to contain and what it actually contains until after a loss occurs is a circumstance to be considered by the jury in determining the truth of the issue, but such failure to discover the discrepancy will not bar the reformation of the contract as a matter of law. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 176</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 588</cite> (1978).

       Insurance contracts are not immune to suits for reformation, even where the insurance company was acting through an agent whose actions may have been unauthorized. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 176</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 588</cite> (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The failure of a party to read a contract which is not signed by that party, such as a policy of insurance, does not bar reformation as a matter of law. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wall, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 176</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 588</cite> (1978).

       - To authorize a verdict reforming a deed upon the ground of mutual mistake, the evidence, like the petition, should at least by inference show the particular mistake and illustrate how it occurred; and the evidence must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive as to the mistake.

      The fact that a complainant does not in express terms allege that an instrument was erroneously executed through mutual mistake does not render it insufficient in law, if it alleges facts from which such a conclusion is reasonably deducible.

       - Where the intent of the parties and their mutual mistake in having failed to notice the discrepancy between that intent and the written document was established by the evidence, the fact that the discrepancy resulted from the landlord's error as scrivener did not preclude reformation of the lease. Zaimis v. Sharis, <cite class="ga_court">275 Ga. 532</cite>, <cite class="app_court">570 S.E.2d 313</cite> (2002).

        Equity will not reform a written contract on account of a mistake unless the mistake was one of both parties;
       
       some particular mutual mistake and how it occurred must be alleged and plainly shown. Rawson v. Brosnan, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 624</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 423</cite> (1939).

       - The grantor may maintain an equitable action to rescind the contract if the grantee is insolvent, or where fraud is employed by the grantee in the procurement of the deed, or there are other special facts which would make rescission by the grantor an appropriate relief. Although insolvency is frequently relied upon, breach of a contract for care and maintenance of the grantor upon the property conveyed present such special facts as authorize rescission. Head v. Walker, <cite class="ga_court">243 Ga. 108</cite>, <cite class="app_court">252 S.E.2d 440</cite> (1979).

       While an absolute deed of conveyance will not be canceled, at the instance of the grantor, merely because of a breach by the grantee of a promise made by him, in consideration of which the deed was executed, and the remedy of the grantor in such a case is a suit for damages for such breach, yet where the grantee was insolvent, and 49 shares of stock were transferred to her in consideration of her learning the plaintiff's business and assisting in its operation, which service she failed and refused to render to the plaintiff, equity would decree a cancellation of the stock certificate and restore the same to the grantor.

       A contractor who has bid for the excavation of highway sites on a basis of "unclassified material" may not, under the guise of mistake of fact, seek additional compensation in an action at law because the material excavated contained a higher percentage of rock than it expected, even though its only information at the time of the bid was results of test borings made available to it by the highway department (now Department of Transportation), where it was specifically stipulated that the data were not guaranteed and did not bind the department; where the department furnished all information which it had available, made no attempt to conceal actual conditions, and stipulated the provisional character of its tests, where the contractor had equal opportunity with the department to conduct its own investigation, and where the parties with knowledge of these facts elected to contract on a basis of material moved rather than to contract on a basis of the percentage of dirt and rock after removal.

       Where the intention of both the insurer and the insured as to the amount of the premium is expressed in the application, as corrected by the insurer as therein authorized, to be $302.90 per quarter, a mistake of the draftsman of the insurer in writing into the policy at another place the amount of the premium as being $750.48 per year, instead of what the insurer claims to have been intended, $750.48 per quarter, is obviously the unilateral mistake of the insurer alone, and there is neither mutuality nor fraud that would authorize reformation to conform with what the insurer claims to have been intended.

       This section does not entitle a party to relief against the consequences of gross and inexcusable negligence
      
      in signing his name to a plain and unambiguous written instrument, when no fraud, artifice, or misrepresentation was employed to induce him to sign it, and when there is nothing to show that it did not embody the identical agreement which the other party actually intended to make. Holton Dodge, Inc. v. Baird, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 316</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E.2d 346</cite> (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Equity will not reform a written contract because of mistake as to the contents of the writing on the part of the complaining party (who was able to read), and fraud of the other which consists only in making false representations as to such contents, on which the complaining party relied as true because of confidence in the party making them; no fiduciary or confidential relation existed between the parties, and no sufficient excuse appears why the complaining party did not read the contract. This doctrine does not apply if the party seeking relief shows some good excuse for not reading the instrument. Livingston v. Barnett, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where no confidential relationship between the parties is alleged, a court of equity will not relieve a vendor of land from his own negligence in not ascertaining facts which he could have ascertained by diligence, the vendee using no artifice or fraudulent scheme in order to prevent the vendor from ascertaining facts which might have prevented him from executing the deed sought to be canceled. Jackson v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 78</cite>, <cite class="app_court">70 S.E.2d 756</cite> (1952).

       - In a suit by a shopping center mortgagee against an insurer and banks seeking damages after the insurer paid the mortgagor insurance proceeds for hail damage to the premises (and the mortgagor's agent fraudulently endorsed the check), the mortgagee was not entitled to summary judgment on the mortgagee's reformation claim based on its listing as a mortgagee/payee on the application and proof of loss form, but not in the policy, because there were issues as to its diligence in reviewing the policy.

      The mere fact that plaintiff grantee and defendant grantee had entered into an agreement with the common grantor whereby each was to purchase separately from the common grantor one half of a described city lot, could not possibly constitute each grantee "an original party" to the deed of conveyance to the other within statute permitting reformation.

       It is an elementary principle of law that a privy, either in law, fact, or estate, has no greater right than the one with whom he is in privity,
      
      accordingly, since the plaintiff's father would have been estopped in law to attack and thus question the validity of the divorce which he procured from the plaintiff's mother, it logically follows that the plaintiff himself is also estopped to do so.

       - In a suit on a promissory note by a lender's assignee, although some evidence supported the borrowers' claim that terms in a Forbearance Agreement (FA) binding the guarantors were the product of mutual mistake and release of the guarantors was intended, the trial court erred in reforming the FA because the borrowers had not overcome the presumption that the assignee was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the mistake.

       - The general rule, which allows only the parties to a judgment to attack and thus question its validity, has been relaxed in this state by this section, however, the privity either in law, in fact, or in estate, which will permit one to attack and thus question the validity of a judgment to which he is not a party has no personal basis as a mere matter of sentiment, but rests upon some actual mutual or successive relationship as to the same right of property.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Primarily the right to reform a contract belongs to the original parties thereto. The recognized extension, under this section, in favor of those in privity with the original contractors does not mean that the terms of a contract can be altered and reformed by one who does not claim as a successor under the contract sought to be reformed, but under another contract, setting up different and inconsistent rights. In such a case, the subsequent grantee's quarrel is with the person from whom he derived his title, rather than with the one holding adversely under a prior and different contract, to which he was admittedly neither party nor privy. Rawson v. Brosnan, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 624</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 423</cite> (1939); Hilton v.

       Where the plaintiff in ejectment was the prior grantee of the tract sued for, not being a privy in law, fact, or estate with the defendant, who held under a subsequent deed from the common grantor, the defendant could not defend by reforming the plaintiff's deed so as to strike therefrom, as having been included by mutual mistake, the tract subsequently conveyed to the defendant.

       Where personal property is sold, and a bill of sale with warranty of title is executed by the vendor, and the property is again sold with warranty of title, the last vendee and his vendor may join in an equitable petition against the original vendor, having for its purpose the reformation of the original bill of sale by including certain items of property omitted therefrom by mutual mistake.

       A partial payment of the purchase money before notice of the equitable title of the true owners, although not sufficient to invest the vendee with the character of a bona fide purchaser as regards the entire estate purchased, will entitle him to invoke the aid of the equitable principle that he who asks equity must do equity and to be reimbursed for the amount actually paid before.

        While it is the rule that a bona fide purchaser of property in which trust funds have been invested is protected,
       
       the beneficiary of a trust estate may at his option, within a reasonable time, "affirm or reject an unauthorized investment by the trustee," and equity will aid the beneficiary in recovering the funds or property, or enforcing a lien for the wrongfully used funds, provided that the assets can be traced and remain in the hands of a person "affected with notice of the misapplication."

        In all cases of fraud equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the law, but the court first taking cognizance of the case will retain it.

         Reluctance of equity to assume jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Though equity has concurrent jurisdiction with law in all cases of fraud except those in wills, unless some substantial equitable relief is sought, equity is reluctant to assume jurisdiction. Walsh v. Campbell, <cite class="ga_app_court">130 Ga. App. 194</cite>, <cite class="app_court">202 S.E.2d 657</cite> (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Any misrepresentation intended to deceive and which does deceive is a fraud, for which a party is entitled to a remedy at law.
       
       Oliver v. O'Kelley, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 762</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 232</cite> (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Misrepresentation is one of the grounds on which equitable relief may be invoked in regard to judgments.
       
       Johnson v. Bogdis, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 535</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1949), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 650</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 658</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       One of the most frequently recurring forms of fraud on the part of one litigant against the other, entitling the latter to relief in equity against the judgment finally entered, is the making of some agreement or representation for the purpose of preventing an appearance or defense in the original action and reliance upon which has had the effect intended. Johnson v. Bogdis, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 535</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1949), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 650</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 658</cite> (1951).

       - While it is true that in all cases of fraud equity has concurrent jurisdiction with the law, equity takes jurisdiction only where the operation of the general rules of law would be deficient in protecting the rights of the complaining party. Gandy v. Robinson Co., <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 190</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 341</cite> (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       This general principle does not authorize a suit in equity merely to recover damages for fraud, since the aggrieved party in such a case has an adequate and complete remedy at law. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Lunsford, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 716</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 727</cite> (1934).

       Where it appeared that insurance company had an adequate remedy at law in a suit filed by the insured against the company claiming disability payments under the policy, a petition in equity brought by the company to cancel the contract of insurance on the ground of fraud in its procurement was properly dismissed on demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Childs, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 835</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 907</cite> (1940).

       Petition seeking to rescind a conditional bill of sale because of alleged fraudulent representations of the vendor as to the kind, quality, and condition of the personalty sold, to recover the portion of the purchase money paid by the vendee, and for injunction, cancellation, and accounting, in which are set up no peculiar circumstances showing a necessity of interposition by a court of equity, such as insolvency or nonresidence of the vendor, is not maintainable in equity, as the plaintiff has an adequate and complete remedy at law, nor would the fact that it was alleged that the vendor was threatening to transfer the conditional sale contract to a third person afford any ground for equitable relief, under the facts. Williford v. Haverty Furn. Co., <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 707</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 521</cite> (1937).

       Judgments of probate courts may be set aside by equity,
      
      in a direct proceeding for that purpose, on the ground that they were procured by fraud. Johnson v. Bogdis, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 535</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1949), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 650</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 658</cite> (1951).

      It has been many times held that judgments of courts of ordinary (now probate courts) may be set aside by equity, in a direct proceeding for that purpose, on the ground that they were procured by fraud.

       A statement of fact is the foundation of fraud under this section.
      
      Daniel v. Dalton News Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 772</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 727</cite> (1934).
      </p>

       <p>

       Fraud is not always perpetrated by willful misrepresentations.
      
      Sapp v. ABC Credit &amp; Inv. Co., <cite class="ga_court">243 Ga. 151</cite>, <cite class="app_court">253 S.E.2d 82</cite> (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Actionable fraud cannot be based upon a promise as to future events;
      
      nor does actionable fraud arise from a mere failure to perform a promise. C.P.D. Chem. Co. v. National Car Rental Sys., <cite class="ga_app_court">148 Ga. App. 756</cite>, <cite class="app_court">252 S.E.2d 665</cite> (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rule is that fraud cannot be predicated upon statements which are promissory in their nature as to future acts. FDIC v. Lattimore Land Corp., 656 F.2d 139 (5th Cir. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       A promise, even a false promise, to perform an act in the future is not a false pretense or false representation, and does not constitute the basis for an action for fraud. FDIC v. Lattimore Land Corp., 656 F.2d 139 (5th Cir. 1981).

       Fraud is either actual or constructive, and either constitutes legal fraud.
      
      Jordan v. Belvin, <cite class="ga_court">57 Ga. 719</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 132</cite> (1938); Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Fraud may be actual or constructive; actual fraud consists in any kind of artifice by which another is deceived, and constructive fraud consists in any act of omission or commission, contrary to legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence justly reposed, which is contrary to good conscience and operates to the injury of another. Brittain Bros. Co. v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 1</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 841</cite> (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Either actual or constructive fraud may consist in the misrepresentation of a material fact.
      
      Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Fraud is exceedingly subtle in its nature and can be accomplished by infinite means; it may be perpetrated by signs and tricks, and even silence may in some instances amount to fraud. Sapp v. ABC Credit &amp; Inv. Co., <cite class="ga_court">243 Ga. 151</cite>, <cite class="app_court">253 S.E.2d 82</cite> (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Fraud cannot consist of mere broken promises, unfulfilled predictions, or erroneous conjectures as to future events.
      
      C.P.D. Chem. Co. v. National Car Rental Sys., <cite class="ga_app_court">148 Ga. App. 756</cite>, <cite class="app_court">252 S.E.2d 665</cite> (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Constructive fraud, as well as actual fraud, voids the contract at the election of the injured party,
      
      and may authorize a rescission of a written release from liability. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Fisher, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 906</cite> (1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      While only actual fraud will authorize an ex parte rescission of a sale of personalty so as to enable the aggrieved party to sue at law, as in trover, for property that he may have delivered to the other under the contract, a sale either of realty or of personalty may be rescinded by a court for mere constructive fraud, where the other essentials of the case are established. Puckett v. Reese, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 716</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1948).

       Any misrepresentation intended to deceive and which does deceive is a fraud,
      
      for which a party is entitled to a remedy at law. Oliver v. O'Kelley, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 762</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 232</cite> (1934); Thompson v.

      In a suit by the seller for the purchase money of land, the defendant purchaser is entitled to plead that he was not put in possession of the premises and that the seller was guilty of false and fraudulent representations as to the existence of liens on the premises, and, upon proof of such facts, a verdict in his favor is authorized. Oliver v. O'Kelley, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 762</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 232</cite> (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where the owner of land represented to the purchaser that there was no encumbrance against the premises sold, thereby inducing him to purchase it, and it was found later to be encumbered, this constituted a fraudulent representation for which relief will be given the purchaser. Oliver v. O'Kelley, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 762</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 232</cite> (1934).

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      To state that a certain individual had signed contract as surety and that her signature was genuine was a misrepresentation of material existing fact, a fraudulent thing in law which would avoid the contract. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Kelly, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga. App. 10</cite>, <cite class="app_court">50 S.E.2d 113</cite> (1948).

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       In the absence of a confidential relationship a party may not rely and act on the misrepresentations of an opposite party
      
      as to the contents of a written instrument where the party signing can read and where no artifice or fraud is practiced which prevents the party signing from reading the instrument. Robi v. Goldstein, <cite class="ga_app_court">100 Ga. App. 606</cite>, <cite class="app_court">112 S.E.2d 165</cite> (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In the absence of special circumstances one must exercise ordinary diligence in making an independent verification of contractual terms and representations, failure to do which will bar an action based on fraud. Hubert v. Beale Roofing, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 145</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 336</cite> (1981).

      One cannot claim to be defrauded about a matter equally open to the observation of all parties where no special relation of trust or confidence exists. Hubert v. Beale Roofing, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 145</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 336</cite> (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Misrepresentations are not actionable unless the hearer was justified in relying on them
      
      in the exercise of common prudence and diligence. Daugert v. Holland Furnace Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 566</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 763</cite> (1963).

       Statements as to future acts merely promissory in their nature are not actionable.

       <p>

       A misrepresentation of a present state of mind is actionable as fraud.
      
      McFarland v. Kim, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 781</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 364</cite> (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      If the plaintiffs represented to the defendant that they would sign a guarantee of defendant's obligations under the lease, knowing that they had no intention of ever doing this in the future, this would not be a broken promise as to a future act but would be a misrepresentation of a present state of mind and actionable as fraud. The failure of the plaintiffs to sign such a guarantee when presented to them by the landlord is some evidence that they had no intention at any time to complete that act. McFarland v. Kim, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 781</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 364</cite> (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Misrepresentations as to a question of law cannot constitute remediable fraud,
      
      because everyone is presumed to know the law and therefore cannot in legal contemplation be deceived by erroneous statements of law, and such representations are ordinarily regarded as mere expressions of opinion. Sorrells v. Atlanta Transit Sys., <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 846</cite> (1963).

       - While a party must exercise reasonable diligence to protect himself against the fraud of another, he is not bound to exhaust all means at his command to ascertain the truth before relying upon the representations. Ordinarily the question whether the complaining party could have ascertained the falsity of the representations by proper diligence is for determination by the jury. Gaines v.

       When the means of knowledge are at hand and equally available to both parties to a contract of sale, if the purchaser does not avail himself of these means, he will not be heard to say, in impeachment of the contract, that he was deceived by the representations of the seller.

       - Whether a fraud is actual depends on whether the false representation was made with the purpose and intent to deceive. Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959).

       In any suit sounding in tort for damages on account of actual fraud, the gist of the action is the purpose and design to deceive. Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Actual fraud involves moral guilt,
       
       since there must be an intentional purpose to deceive. Turner v. Ware, <cite class="ga_app_court">2 Ga. App. 57</cite>, <cite class="app_court">58 S.E. 310</cite> (1907); Gaultney v.

        <p>

        A material misrepresentation constituting actual fraud may give rise to an independent action in tort for deceit,
       
       to recover for damage thus occasioned. In such a suit it is necessary to show, not only that a material misrepresentation was made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act, that he had a right to act, and that he did act thereon to his injury, but it must be shown that such representation was willfully and knowingly false, or what the law regards as the equivalent of knowledge, a reckless or fraudulent representation about that which the party pretends to know, but about which he knows that he does not know, and by which false pretense his purpose and intent is to deceive. Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959).

       - In an independent affirmative action for fraud and deceit, which must be predicated upon actual fraud, the plaintiff must allege and prove the following essential ingredients: (1) the defendant made the representations; (2) at the time he knew they were false (or what the law regards as the equivalent of knowledge, a fraudulent or reckless representation of facts as true, which the party may not know to be false, if intended to deceive); (3) the defendant made the representations with the intention and purpose of deceiving the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff relied upon such representations; (5) the plaintiff sustained the alleged loss and damage as the proximate result of their having been made; and (6) (an element frequently omitted in the cases enumerating the essentials), want of knowledge by the party alleged to have been deceived that the representation was false. It is essential that the plaintiff was deceived and there can be no deceit if the plaintiff knows that the representations upon which he is alleged to have acted were false. Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959); Romedy v. Willett Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">136 Ga.

       <p>
        To allege fraud, the claimant must contend the defendant knowingly made a false representation with the intent and purpose of deceiving the plaintiff. Additionally, there must be a reliance on such representations and a loss sustained thereby. The misrepresentations must also relate to a preexisting or present fact and not statements or representations involving future conduct. Cone Mills Corp. v. A.G. Estes, Inc., 377 F. Supp. 222 (N.D. Ga. 1974).

       A promise to take title to the property, farm it, pay off the debt existing thereon, and then to reconvey it to the plaintiff, made as an inducement or consideration for the execution of a deed by plaintiff, does not constitute fraud, so as to authorize cancellation of the deed, or a decree of specific performance of the agreement to convey, unless the promise was made with the present intention not to comply with it. A mere failure to comply with the promise would be insufficient to establish such fraudulent intent. Dixon v. Dixon, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 557</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E.2d 369</cite> (1955).

       The five elements of fraud and deceit in Georgia are: (1) false representation made by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) an intention to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from acting in reliance by the plaintiff; (4) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (5) damage to the plaintiff. Marriott Corp. v. American Academy of Psychotherapists, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 497</cite>, <cite class="app_court">277 S.E.2d 785</cite> (1981).

        <p>
       The five elements necessary to be shown in an action for fraud are that the misrepresentation or falsehood was knowingly made, that it related to a material fact, that its purpose was to deceive another and induce him to act, that he did act upon it and that he was injured as a result. Day v. Randolph, <cite class="ga_app_court">159 Ga. App. 474</cite>, <cite class="app_court">283 S.E.2d 687</cite> (1981).

        Actual fraud is not essential to support an action in equity to rescind a contract for fraud,
       
       or to a plea of fraud to a suit on a contract; innocently made material misrepresentations which the opposite party has a right to act on, and does act on to his injury, and which amount only to constructive fraud, being sufficient in these last two instances. By a parity of reasoning, actual fraud is not essential to the setting aside of an accord and satisfaction. Jordan v. Belvin, <cite class="ga_court">57 Ga. 719</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 132</cite> (1938).

       <p>

       Constructive fraud does not involve moral guilt,
      
      since it is the act itself, as taken in connection with the relationship of the parties, and not the guilty purpose or intent, which constitutes constructive fraud. Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Innocent misrepresentations, when made by one charged with a special duty to the opposite party to know and to impart the truth, under the statutes and decisions of this state cannot amount to anything more than constructive fraud, and, as such, are not creative of any independent right of action for damages in tort in favor of the injured party; but they may support an action in equity to rescind a contract so induced or be pleaded in defense to a suit on a contract thus procured, or may, it might seem, under the doctrine of estoppel, be employed in support of an action founded on the contract itself. Gaultney v. Windham, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 800</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1959).

      If a person having legal title to land, which fact he does not know but has convenient means of knowing, and after a lapse of 27 years, during which time he was under no legal disability, he still has not learned the fact of his interest in the land, and in those circumstances he induces one to buy the land from a third person by representations that the land is the property of such third person, his misrepresentations to the purchaser innocently made, coupled with his delay in ascertaining the truth, will amount to constructive fraud, and they may be pleaded as an estoppel by the purchaser on the faith of the title of his vendor. Lanier v. Bryant, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 409</cite>, <cite class="app_court">179 S.E. 346</cite> (1935).

      Constructive fraud may arise out of any act of omission or commission, contrary to legal or equitable duty, trust or confidence justly reposed, which is contrary to good conscience and operates to the injury of another; constructive fraud may moreover be consistent with innocence and not smacking with moral guilt. Graham v. Hogan, <cite class="ga_app_court">185 Ga. App. 842</cite>, <cite class="app_court">366 S.E.2d 219</cite> (1988).

       - Where there is no evidence of suppression, misrepresentation or concealment or bad faith so as to impute moral guilt, the mere omission of a matter from a document coupled with the failure to reveal the omission can hardly be even constructive fraud unless it is "contrary to good conscience."

       - Where claimant was seeking workers' compensation benefits from the employer based on her alleged total disability and inability to work but at the same time she took this position before the Workers' Compensation Board, she was gainfully employed by a different employer, this is evidence sufficient to support the superior court's finding of constructive fraud.

   Constructive fraud is an equitable doctrine that would not support the accused person's request for damages under these circumstances, especially since the evidence did not show they knew or should have known of the impropriety surrounding the transaction.

       Fraud is either actual or constructive, and either constitutes legal fraud.
      
      Jordan v. Belvin, <cite class="ga_court">57 Ga. 719</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 132</cite> (1938); Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Fisher, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 906</cite> (1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Concealment by defendant of the financial status of the corporation when it was in fact a losing business facing lawsuits coupled with delivery of nonvoting stock instead of the promised voting stock constituted legal fraud when it was proven to the satisfaction of the jury. Adkins v. Lee, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 261</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 252</cite> (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Misrepresentation of a material fact, if made by mistake, and innocently, and acted on by the opposite party to his injury, constitutes constructive fraud under this section. Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Fisher, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 906</cite> (1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In the case of fire and life insurance applications a misrepresentation is material if the misrepresentation changes the character, nature or extent of the risk. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 144</cite>, cert. dismissed, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 211</cite>, <cite class="app_court">132 S.E.2d 556</cite> (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where it is shown that a material statement in an application is false which was known to the insured at the time he made it and it was made with a view toward obtaining the insurance, with the company having no knowledge of its falsity, where the company acted upon it to its injury, the law will conclusively presume an intent to deceive, and a case of actual fraud will be made out. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 144</cite>, cert. dismissed, <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 211</cite>, <cite class="app_court">132 S.E.2d 556</cite> (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Any misrepresentation intended to deceive and which does deceive is a fraud, for which a party is entitled to a remedy at law.
      
      Adkins v. Lee, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 261</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 252</cite> (1972).

        In order for a fraud to be actionable, the representation relied on must be more than a promise which is void

       or unenforceable. Barrett v. Independent Order of Foresters, 625 F.2d 73 (5th Cir. 1980).

       <b>
        Statements as to the nature of insurance coverage

       - Salesman fraudulently induced customers to execute a sales contract by representing that "blue sculpted" carpet was available when he knew it was not or recklessly asserted the fact with intent to deceive. Country Pride Homes, Inc. v. DuBois, <cite class="ga_app_court">201 Ga. App. 740</cite>, <cite class="app_court">412 S.E.2d 282</cite> (1991).

        <p>

        Civil fraud and theft by deception have different elements
       
       and showing that there are jury issues as to fraud does not necessarily show that there are jury issues as to theft by deception; a failure to show the level of intent needed for proving theft by deception would preclude a jury issue on that crime as a predicate act for RICO purposes, defeating a RICO claim. Avery v. Chrysler Motors Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">214 Ga. App. 602</cite>, <cite class="app_court">448 S.E.2d 737</cite> (1994).

       - Material misrepresentation, made for the purpose of inducing another to execute a promissory note, will authorize the maker, after executing the note, to rescind the transaction on discovery, of the fraud, if he relied upon the representation and was induced thereby to execute the note. Thompson v. Wilkins, <cite class="ga_app_court">143 Ga. App. 739</cite>, <cite class="app_court">240 S.E.2d 183</cite> (1977).

       A promise to do a certain thing for the benefit of the promisee, made to induce his entrance into a contract, the promisee earnestly believing that he would receive the benefits consequent upon the fulfillment of the promise, when at the time of making the promise there was no intention on the part of the promisor to fulfill it, but, on the contrary, the promise was made with intent not to fulfill it and was uttered as a mere scheme or device to defraud, is such a fraud as will void any contract induced thereby. A promise thus fraudulently made will authorize rescission of a written instrument purporting to be a contract. Price v. Mitchell, <cite class="ga_app_court">154 Ga.

       - Misrepresentation of a material fact, made by one of the parties to a contract, though made by mistake, and innocently, if acted on by the opposite party, constitutes legal fraud, and the party injured in consequence thereof may set up the damages thus arising in defense to an action upon the contract. Morton v. W.T. Tharpe &amp; Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">41 Ga. App. 788</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 716</cite> (1930).

       Where a vendor agrees to sell a designated tract of land to another and points out to the latter its boundaries and where such boundaries include lands to which the vendor has no title, in consequence of which the purchaser loses the same, the purchaser can setoff at law the value of the portion of the land so lost, against the purchase money whether the representations were designedly made by the vendor to deceive the purchaser, or were innocently made.

       An equitable action to cancel a deed on the ground of fraud, which clearly shows that the complainant failed to use even slight diligence to discover the fraud, fails to allege a cause of action. Courts of equity will not grant relief to one whose long delay renders the ascertainment of the truth difficult, though no legal limitation bars the action. Whitfield v.

       While the doctrine of caveat emptor would charge the purchaser with looking out for the title which the seller had to the tract offered for sale as his, it would not charge him with looking out for the boundaries of that tract when the seller undertook to locate and point them out, thus professing to know them sufficiently to enable them to furnish this information to purchasers instead of leaving the latter to their own resources in acquiring the information.

       In order to give rise to an action for damages, the defendant's fraud must be actual,
      
      i.e., the misrepresentation must be made either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the consequences. Irvin v. Lowe's of Gainesville, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 828</cite>, <cite class="app_court">302 S.E.2d 734</cite> (1983).

The assignee's attorney did not defraud them or conceal any facts, but advised them to hire an attorney, and any failure to advise them of their legal rights was an opinion as to a matter of law and not a material fact.

       - Listing broker was not obligated to communicate to the couple that the home they purchased was slightly smaller in size than the subdivision's model home the couple wanted duplicated on their lot as the purchase contract plainly stated that the couple had no right to rely on the listing broker as the couple's broker, that the couple had no confidential relationship with the listing broker, and that the couple was solely responsible for protecting the couple's own interests, as the couple was required to exercise due diligence before it could rely on the listing broker's representations and the couple did not do so.

       - The failure of the insured to supply information as to health problems when no inquiry is made by the insurer or its agents and neither the certificate or master policy of insurance inform the insured that certain illnesses are not covered will not raise a defense of fraud or material misrepresentation in a suit on a credit life insurance policy.

        - In a dispute between a concert booking agent and concert venue owners, the agent's fraud claim arising out of the owners' alleged promises to renew the agreement failed because the agent failed to show that the promises caused the agent harm.

       Even though a bank had a duty to notify its customer of a change in its signature verification procedures, where there was no evidence that the bank refrained from informing its customers in order to induce them to take or refrain from taking any certain action, there was no showing of constructive fraud.

       Fraud may exist as much in intentional concealment of material facts as in false statements in regard to facts; one is as fraudulent as the other if it is used as a means of deceiving the opposite party. It was error to grant summary judgment where the facts indicated a deliberate concealment of assets with the possible intent to deprive a creditor of those assets. Miller v.

       Since the plaintiffs alleged that at the time the plaintiffs purchased the plaintiffs' vehicles, the manufacturer and the distributor failed to disclose to the plaintiffs or to the public the fact that there were underlying safety defects with the gasoline tanks in the models that the plaintiffs purchased, the plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the defendants omitted a material fact that the defendants had a duty to disclose under O.C.G.A.

      Anything which happens without the agency or fault of the party affected by it, tending to disturb and confuse his judgment or to mislead him, of which the opposite party takes an undue advantage, is in equity a surprise and is a form of fraud for which relief is granted.

       - A person, by long and exclusive use, may acquire a trade name; and when thus acquired, such trade name is as much descriptive of the manufacturer or producer as is his own name, and the infringement of such trade name of an individual will be enjoined by a court of equity when a proper case is made. Womble v. Parker, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 378</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 133</cite> (1951).

       While generic names, geographical names, and names composed of words which are merely descriptive are incapable of exclusive appropriation, words or names which have a primary meaning of their own, such as words descriptive of the goods, service, or place where they are made, or the name of the maker, may nevertheless, by long use in connection with the business of the particular trade, come to be understood by the public as designating the goods, service, or business of a particular trader.

       - When a person knows of a trade name used by another person, and, notwithstanding this knowledge, uses a similar name in his own business operations, the courts will presume that he has encroached upon the name of the other intentionally and fraudulently. Womble v. Parker, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 378</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 133</cite> (1951); Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961).

       - While the color of merchandise or its wrapper or container may be one of the important indicia of a fraudulent purpose, if accompanied by other confusing factors such as size, shape, name, printing, or design in the make-up of the article, yet color alone, except possibly where some peculiar and distinctive combination of colors is employed, is not sufficient to establish fraudulent intent, since no one is permitted from the mere prior use of such an all-belonging thing as a color to obtain a monopoly in its use for any particular purpose.

       Testimony of defendant's manager, that he was forced to discontinue less expensive white waxed paper and use more costly "tango" colored cellophane wrapper for his whole wheat bread in order to meet the competition of the plaintiff, could not be taken to establish a fraudulent purpose as a matter of fact, when the act itself did not so indicate, where he also testified that cellophane was a more desirable and more attractive wrapper, and that the color was a more suitable and appropriate transparent wrapper for the brown bread, and where the product was without any other similarities as to the plainly printed labels both inside and outside the wrapper, the ones outside being strikingly different in color.

        The general purpose of the law controlling trade names and unfair competition is the prevention of fraudulent interference

       with rights of the lawful holder of a trade name and protection of the public from imposition. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic principle of the law of unfair competition is that no one has a right to dress up his goods or business or otherwise represent the same in such a manner as to deceive an intending purchaser and induce him to believe he is buying the goods of another, and that no one has the right to avail himself of another's favorable reputation in order to sell his own goods. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The good will and reputation of a business is as much an asset as its physical properties,
      
      and it may as well be the subject of a fraudulent encroachment by an infringer. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 209</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 19</cite> (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       An encroachment on the business of another may be made without direct market competition.
      
      Gordy v. Dunwody, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 627</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 886</cite> (1953), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 810</cite>, <cite class="app_court">83 S.E.2d 7</cite> (1954).

      <p>
       <p>
      The words "encroach upon the business of a trader" cannot be said to limit the equitable relief available under this section to those in direct and actual market competition with an alleged infringer or to those cases where it is shown that there has been an actual diversion of trade from one business to another.

       <p>
        - Although the rights in a trade name are exclusive within certain geographical limits, this section does not create rights good against anyone, anywhere. The outer limits are set by the requirement that the plaintiff must show a similarity that is confusing to the public. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While geographical names and words which are merely descriptive are not generally the subject of exclusive appropriation as trade-marks or trade-names, such names and words when used so long and exclusively by a trader, manufacturer, or producer that they are generally understood to designate his business or merchandise, may acquire a secondary signification or meaning indicative not only of the place of manufacture, but of the name of the manufacturer or producer, or of the character of the product, so that the name or title thus employed, including the geographical name and descriptive words, may be the subject of protection against unfair competition in trade, and authorize equity to enjoin a newcomer competitor from the appropriation and use of a trade-name or trade-mark bearing such resemblances to those of the pioneer as to be likely to produce uncertainty and confusion, and to pass off the goods or business of one as those of the other. Womble v. Parker, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 378</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 133</cite> (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Unless it appears that there is or will probably be a deception of ordinary buyers and the general public into thinking that the goods or business of one is the business or goods of another and thus bring about the sale of one man's goods as the goods of the other, the case is damnum absque injuria for which no action lies. Atlanta Paper Co. v. Jacksonville Paper Co., <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 777</cite> (1937).

       An infringement upon the real name or trade-name of an individual or corporation is such a colorable imitation of the name that the general public, in the exercise of ordinary care, might think that it is the name of the individual or corporation first appropriating the same. Multiple Listing Serv., Inc. v. Metropolitan Multi-List, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 837</cite>, <cite class="app_court">159 S.E.2d 52</cite> (1968), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 129</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E.2d 356</cite> (1969).

       - It is not essential, as a prerequisite to the granting of equitable relief in an action for infringement of a trade name, that actual and direct market competition between the litigants be shown, and that the test as to whether equitable relief is available, should not be limited to those cases where it is shown that there has been an actual diversion of trade from one business to another. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 209</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 19</cite> (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       The early common-law rule, and the rule still maintained in some jurisdictions, has been to the effect that there must be shown actual or direct competition between the litigants as an essential prerequisite to relief in an action for infringement of a trade name or unfair trade competition. Under this view, the exclusive test is whether there is a diversion of trade from one business to another, and injury to the good will and reputation of the original user of the trade name, or other injuries as contemplated by the theories of relief afford no basis for equitable relief. Under the modern view, the emphasis is no longer on direct and actual market competition, or diversion of trade from one business to another, but rather on the injury suffered by the complaining party and the public from the confusion resulting from the infringer's acts. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 209</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 19</cite> (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Diversion of trade and the attendant direct loss of sales is not the only injury that may result from infringement of a trade name, but other injuries would necessarily follow, such as an injury to the complaining party's reputation and good will.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>

       The "passing off" rule is sufficient to afford a test as to whether there is unfair competition.
      
      The test under this rule is whether the goods or business of one are in fact "passed off" as the goods or business of another, and it has been said, in cases between litigants in actual and direct market competition, that nothing less than such conduct will constitute unfair competition. Kay Jewelry Co. v. Kapiloff, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 209</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 19</cite> (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Any conduct, the nature and probable tendency and effect of which is to deceive the public so as to pass off the goods or business of one person as and for the goods or business of another, constitutes actionable unfair competition. The essence thereof consists in the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor for those of another. Atlanta Paper Co. v. Jacksonville Paper Co., <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 777</cite> (1937).

        - Any conduct, the nature and probable tendency and effect of which is to deceive the public so as to pass off the goods or business of one person as and for the goods or business of another, constitutes actionable unfair competition.

        <p>
       In Georgia, to have a word or words claimed as a trade mark protected by injunction from use by another, it should appear that the defendant's use of them was with intent to deceive or mislead the public. Atlanta Paper Co. v. Jacksonville Paper Co., <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 777</cite> (1937).

        Relief under this section depends upon showing of intent to deceive.
       
       However, this intent may be presumed if encroachment is done with knowledge of the prior right. Giant Mart Corp. v. Giant Disct. Foods, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 683</cite> (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words, acts and conduct prove intent, and are the usual and ordinary means adopted by courts of justice to establish it. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although intent must be found to warrant an injunction, when it comes to finding intent courts look to the effect of a defendant's "words, acts and conduct" and ask the objective questions of whether the plaintiff held an exclusive right to the trade mark or name and whether the defendant encroached upon it. Thompson v. Alpine Motor Lodge, Inc., 296 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1961).
       </p>

       - After the husband engaged counsel to draw up a formal post-nuptial agreement, and the husband moved to enforce the agreement when the wife filed for divorce, the post-nuptial agreement was unenforceable as the wife testified that the wife signed the agreement because the husband represented to the wife that, if the wife signed the agreement, the husband would understand that the wife loved the husband, and the husband would tear up the agreement; the husband procured the wife's signature on the agreement under the pretense that the agreement would never be enforced and, in fact, that the agreement would be destroyed, and the evidence was sufficient to establish the existence of fraud in procuring the agreement.

       - Evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict under the plaintif's theory of fraudulent transfer and civil conspiracy as some evidence authorized the jury to find that a deed conveying the property owner's sole interest to the real property to the owner and one defendant as joint tenants with right of survivorship without any money exchanged prior to death was to evade the plaintiff before a promissory note was paid.

       - After the husband engaged counsel to draw up a formal post-nuptial agreement, and the husband moved to enforce the agreement when the wife filed for divorce, the post-nuptial agreement was unenforceable as the wife testified that the wife signed the agreement because the husband represented to the wife that, if the wife signed the agreement, the husband would understand that the wife loved the husband, and the husband would tear up the agreement; the husband procured the wife's signature on the agreement under the pretense that the agreement would never be enforced and, in fact, that the agreement would be destroyed, and the evidence was sufficient to establish the existence of fraud in procuring the agreement.

       - Since proof of fraud is seldom if ever possible by direct evidence, recourse to circumstantial evidence is a necessity, and there is no kind of action wherein it can be held with greater reason that the fact in issue may be inferred from other facts proved. Durrence v. Durrence, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 620</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E.2d 740</cite> (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Rarely, if ever, can a fraudulent intent be shown by direct proof,
       
       and where transactions between relatives are under review, slight circumstances are often sufficient to induce belief on the part of the jury that there was fraud between the parties. Bucher v. Murray, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 259</cite>, <cite class="app_court">91 S.E.2d 610</cite> (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       An attack on a will as having been obtained by undue influence may be supported by a wide range of testimony, since such influence can seldom be shown except by circumstantial evidence. Thus, a confidential relation between the parties, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the disposition of the testator's estate, old age, or disease affecting the strength of the mind, tending to support any other direct testimony or any other proven fact or circumstance going to show the exercise of undue influence on the mind and will of the testator, are relevant. While the quantity of influence varies with the circumstances of each case, according to the relations existing between the parties and the strength or weakness of mind of the testator, the amount of influence necessary to dominate a mind impaired by age or disease may be decidedly less than that required to control a strong mind. Bowman v. Bowman, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 796</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E.2d 298</cite> (1949).

       According to the relations existing between the parties and the strength or weakness of mind of a testator, the amount of influence necessary to dominate a mind impaired by age or disease may be decidedly less than that required to control a strong mind.

       Where the grantor of an "improvident or profuse" deed was not wholly incapable of entering into such a contract, but was possessed of little or no will power and was greatly under the influence of the nephew to whom the deed was executed, an inference of fraud could have been drawn by the jury, and, the evidence for the defendant grantee not being such as to rebut the inference as a matter of law, the court was authorized to charge the jury upon the subject of fraud. Stanley v. Stanley, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 135</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 496</cite> (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the broad statement that the conduct of the defendant constituted fraud would be insufficient without an allegation of circumstances from which the court might determine whether the pleader reached the right conclusion in saying that a fraud was committed, still it is not essential to state more facts than may be necessary to carry conviction of the existence of fraud. Wall v. Wall, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 757</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 893</cite> (1933).
       </p>

       "Great inadequacy of consideration, joined with great disparity of mental ability in contracting a bargain, may justify equity in setting aside a sale or other contract." Under that principle, a deed may be set aside in equity, on proof to the two elements stated, "without proof of anything else" as to fraud. A fortiori, the same rule would apply with at least equal force in case of such mental disparity and a total absence of consideration. Stow v. Hargrove, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 454</cite> (1948).

        <p>
       The evidence showing that a 75-year old woman, uneducated, with neither the ability to read nor write, was dealing with an experienced businessman under circumstances indicating a fraud establishes that there was an imbalance or "disparity of mental ability in contracting a bargain." Top Quality Homes, Inc. v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">231 Ga. 844</cite>, <cite class="app_court">204 S.E.2d 600</cite> (1974).

       Circumstances apparently trivial or almost inconclusive, if separately considered, may by their number and joint operation, especially when corroborated by moral coincidences, be sufficient to constitute conclusive proof. Kelly v. Cubbedge, <cite class="ga_app_court">143 Ga. App. 830</cite>, <cite class="app_court">240 S.E.2d 162</cite> (1977).
       </p>

        <p>
       Proof of fraud is seldom, if ever, susceptible of direct proof; thus, recourse to circumstantial evidence usually is required. Brown v. Mann, <cite class="ga_app_court">237 Ga. App. 247</cite>, <cite class="app_court">514 S.E.2d 922</cite> (1999).
       </p>

        <p>

        In every case slight circumstances must be considered, and may be sufficient to establish the existence of fraud,
       
       in transactions between husband and wife fraud might be so completely concealed that creditors could not expose it, and in order that the public might not suffer from such concealment, the law imposes upon the husband and wife the duty of affirmatively establishing their good faith when creditors attack such transactions for fraud. Arrington v. Awbrey, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 193</cite>, <cite class="app_court">8 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where transactions between relatives are under review, slight circumstances are often sufficient to induce belief on the part of a jury that there was fraud or collusion between the parties, and authorize them to find against the claimant and in favor of the plaintiff in fi. fa. A claimant must, generally speaking, come into court with hands unstained by any suggestion of collusion with the defendant in fi. fa. to defeat or defraud the creditors of the latter; and a claimant who fails to make a clear showing of both legal and moral right to the property in dispute must generally suffer the loss thereof at the hands of a jury, if there be any circumstances in proof, even though slight, which may be sufficient to authorize the inference of fraud or collusion. Scruggs v. Blackshear Mfg. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">49 Ga. App. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E. 732</cite> (1934).

         Evidence necessary to defeat abusive litigation claim.

        <p>
       - In a suit for fraud, misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy allegedly arising out of a real estate transaction, and a counterclaim for abusive litigation, where the record revealed hotly contested versions of what the parties considered to have transpired in the complex real estate transaction, given that the law requires only slight circumstances to establish fraud and conspiracy, the trial judge was authorized to find as a matter of law that the plaintiffs had pierced an essential element of the defendant's abusive litigation claim and were thus entitled to the grant of summary judgment thereon. Seckinger v. Holtzendorf, <cite class="ga_app_court">200 Ga. App. 604</cite>, <cite class="app_court">409 S.E.2d 76</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">200 Ga.

        Whether a note or other writing was procured by fraud is a question of fact for the determination of a jury.

      Because there was no evidence of a confidential relationship between a manufacturer and a broker beyond the contractual obligation for the broker to post bonds on behalf of the manufacturer, and the broker did not act on the manufacturer's behalf in any business transactions and was obligated only to secure the posting of the needed bonds, it was nothing more than an arms-length transaction, and the trial court's charge to the jury on agency and fiduciary relationships was error.

         Confidential relationship distinguished from trade secret.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - An item may be considered confidential in the context of a business relationship without rising to the level of a trade secret. A confidential relationship is distinguished by the expectations of the parties involved, while a secret is identified through rigorous examination of the information sought to be protected. Roboserve, Ltd. v. Tom's Foods, Inc., 931 F.2d 789 (11th Cir. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         There is never a presumption of confidential relationship.
        </b>
        The burden is upon the party asserting same to establish its existence. United States ex rel. Meva Corp. v. Northeast Constr. Co., 298 F. Supp. 1135 (S.D. Ga. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is never a presumption of a confidential relationship. The burden is upon the party asserting the same to establish its existence. Anderson Chem. Co. v. Portals Water Treatment, Inc., 768 F. Supp. 1568 (M.D. Ga. 1991), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 971 F.2d 756 (11th Cir. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A confidential relationship does not exist prior to the contract or legal relationship creating it,
       
       unless it exists for other reasons. Cole v. Cates, <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 540</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 165</cite> (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Whether or not the confidential relationship of partners applies to transactions outside of the scope of the partnership, it does not apply where it appears that the partnership was not in existence at the time of the transaction under consideration. Hancock v. Gunter, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 772</cite> (1943).

        - In order for this Code section to be applicable, a definite fiduciary relationship must exist between plaintiff and the other party. Anderson Chem. Co. v. Portals Water Treatment, Inc., 768 F. Supp. 1568 (M.D. Ga. 1991), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 971 F.2d 756 (11th Cir. 1992).

         Aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Georgia law does not recognize the tort of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, and a Georgia court faced with the issue would not be likely to create such a cause of action since the imposition of aider and abettor liability for such breaches essentially extends fiduciary obligations beyond the scope of the confidential or special relationship upon which these duties are based. Munford, Inc. v. Munford, 188 Bankr. 860 (N.D. Ga. 1994), aff'd, 97 F.3d 449 (11th Cir. 1996), 97 F.3d 456 (11th Cir. 1996), aff'd on other grounds, 98 F.3d 604 (11th Cir. 1996).

         Party to confidential relationship may rely upon representations of other party.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The reason for the rule that a party to a confidential or fiduciary relationship may rely upon representations made is that by the very terms or circumstances of the arrangement of dealings between the parties there rests upon the party acting for another the duty of protecting and furthering the interests of the person for whom he is acting, not those of himself or of any one else. The person so placing trust in him by virtue of this confidential relationship is justified by the situation of this interest in believing that the other party will act fairly and make true representations. Dover v. Burns, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 19</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 785</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And the required degree of care to detect fraud is much less where there is a confidential relationship between two parties
        </b>
        than in cases where parties deal at arm's length. United States ex rel. Meva Corp. v. Northeast Constr. Co., 298 F. Supp. 1135 (S.D. Ga. 1969).

         Failure to protect confidential information.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Dismissal of the plaintiff's cause of action against a state agency for disclosure of private information for failure to state a cause of action was affirmed because in alleging that the plaintiff gave the agency personal information as a prerequisite to receiving services, with the expectation that it would protect the plaintiff's information, the plaintiff failed to assert in the complaint facts showing that the agency owed the plaintiff a confidential duty to protect that information. McConnell v. Department of Labor, <cite class="ga_app_court">337 Ga. App. 457</cite>, <cite class="app_court">787 S.E.2d 794</cite> (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Therefore, ordinary diligence not required where confidential relationship exists.
       
       The numerous decisions to the effect that a party who can read must read, and that fraud which will relieve a party who can read must be such as prevents him from reading, apply to situations where the parties are dealing with each other at arms length, and have no application to a situation where the confidential and fiduciary relation of principal and agent is involved. Harrison v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 214</cite> (1958); Allen v. Sanders, <cite class="ga_app_court">176 Ga.

      The showing of a relationship in fact which justifies the reposing of confidence by one party in another is all the law requires. Cochran v. Murrah, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 304</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 421</cite> (1975); Vitner v. Funk, <cite class="ga_app_court">182 Ga.

       The relationships listed as examples in this section are not exclusive,

       This section goes beyond the strict fiduciary relations of the parties to the particular circumstances of the case.

       Although some confidential relationships are created by law and contract (e.g., partners), others may be created by the facts
      
      of the particular case. Cochran v. Murrah, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 304</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 421</cite> (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In addition to partners and principals and agents, it has been held that confidential relationships may exist between husband and wife, brother and sister, and even banks and creditors of a depositor. Cochran v. Murrah, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 304</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 421</cite> (1975).

      The mere fact that the defendant had confidence in the party with whom he contracted does not constitute a confidential relationship or a "similar relationship of mutual confidence" within the meaning of this section so as to require the application of

      Allegation that defendant was a frequent visitor in the plaintiff's home and that he had been a close personal, confidential and business adviser to the plaintiff did not establish the existence of a confidential relationship between them within the meaning of this section. Charles v. Simmons, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 794</cite>, <cite class="app_court">113 S.E.2d 604</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">364 U.S. 871</cite>, <cite class="s_court">81 S.

      <p>
       <p>
      The fact that it is alleged that a plaintiff reposed trust and confidence in the defendant does not create a confidential relationship. In the majority of business dealings opposite parties have trust and confidence in each other's integrity, but there is no confidential relationship by this alone. This state of facts does not bring the plaintiff within the protection of this section. Dover v. Burns, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 19</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 785</cite> (1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the plaintiffs offered evidence demonstrating that defendant was their personal friend and had conducted business with them on matters not relating to investments, this evidence is not sufficient to establish a confidential relationship between the parties so as to justify the plaintiffs reposing trust in defendant. Garland v. Advance Med. Funding L.P., 86 F. Supp. 2d 1195 (N.D. Ga. 2000).

      Statements made by a corporate officer and owner to investors of a mortgage company that the officer would be obligated on each and every loan and would personally manage their money and be involved with the management of the company did not create a confidential relationship; additionally, the investors had their own financial advisor.

       - Whether a confidential relationship existed between plaintiff and his employer's agents, and whether plaintiff justifiably relied on representations regarding group insurance coverage, were questions for the jury.

        A confidential relationship is distinguished by the expectations of the parties involved, while a trade secret is identified through rigorous examination of the information sought to be protected. The jury is empowered to decide whether a confidential relationship exists under the facts of a particular case. Roboserve, Ltd. v. Tom's Foods, Inc., 940 F.2d 1441 (11th Cir. 1991).

       Trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to a client's breach of fiduciary duty claim, which was not a mere duplication of the legal malpractice claim that was based on the establishment of a fiduciary, attorney-client relationship that was breached, as: (1) material fact issues remained as to whether an attorney-client relationship existed between the client and the attorney; (2) the question of legal malpractice remained an issue; and (3) the client had the right to plead alternative theories, and the jury should be permitted to decide the breach of fiduciary duty claim should they find no attorney-client relationship existed.

   §
   523(a)(4) claim against a Chapter 13 debtor, their attorney, was dismissed for failure to state a claim, as the creditors failed to allege a contract or other agreement establishing a technical trust, but instead cited O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c02s23-2-58" target="_self">23-2-58</a></cite>, which the court held did not establish fiduciary capacity, as the statute did not designate trust property or impose trust duties. Further, none of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct cited by the creditors, Ga. St. Bar R. 4-102(d):1.1, 1.3, 1.6, and 1.7(a), mentioned trust property and thus, those rules were ineffective to establish fiduciary capacity for purposes of 11 U.S.C.

       <p>
        Attorney breached fiduciary duties to a bankruptcy debtor since the debtor's reliance on the attorney as a family attorney and the attorney's controlling influence over the debtor established an attorney-client relationship with regard to a real property transaction, and the attorney induced the debtor to execute documents which were not in the debtor's best interests and instead benefitted the attorney and other parties.

       The trial court correctly determined that there was no evidence of special circumstances imposing upon the bank the duties of a fiduciary in favor of borrowing petroleum companies such that summary judgment as to any claim for breach of fiduciary duty was correct.

       Trial court did not err in granting judgment on the pleadings to a bank as to a customer's claim for breach of a duty of confidentiality because the customer failed to assert in the complaint facts showing that the bank owed the customer a confidential duty or invaded the customer's privacy, and the customer did not plead any special circumstances showing that the customer had a particular relationship of trust or mutual confidence with the bank; the bank-customer relationship is not confidential.

       The entire business structure of the parties, their interactions and dealings over the course of several years, and their common goal all furnished a basis for a jury to find a relationship in fact which justified the reposal of confidence on the part of one party and good faith on the part of the others.

        Parties' merger agreement and post-merger relationship did not establish a confidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties since the plaintiff did not exercise sole and exclusive control over the termination of a lease held by the defendant; also, the mere fact that the plaintiff's signature was required on instructions to the escrow agent for the release of escrow funds did not establish a confidential relationship.

       There is little question that a former employee's relationship with the employer was one which required confidence under O.C.G.A.

       On a breach of fiduciary duty claim against a former employee concerning the employee's alleged solicitation of the employee's co-workers, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the employee because, even assuming that the employee had the authority to bind the employer with respect to customer contracts, there was no evidence that the employee had the authority to bind the company on employment matters or relations. Thus, although the employee may have owed the company a fiduciary duty with respect to the customer contracts the employee entered into on its behalf, there was no evidence that the employee occupied a similar confidential relationship with respect to employee relations. Gordon Document Prods. v. Serv. Techs., <cite class="ga_app_court">308 Ga. App. 445</cite>, <cite class="app_court">708 S.E.2d 48</cite> (2011).

       Because the employer failed to point out specific evidence giving rise to a triable issue as to the former employee's status as an agent owing a fiduciary duty to the principal, the employer failed to show error in the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the employee on the employer's claim for breach of fiduciary duty.

       Evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of criminal attempt to commit theft by taking by a fiduciary as the relationship between the defendant and the employer was merely that of employer-employee because, although the defendant was responsible for creating invoices, the defendant did not have authority to act for the employer beyond weighing the metals and assigning to the weight a dollar amount that had been previously fixed by the employer; and the defendant could not negotiate with the customers or independently determine how much the metals were worth; thus, although the conviction for criminal attempt to commit theft by taking stood, the felony sentence, based on the defendant being a fiduciary, was reversed.

       The policy of the law forbids that administrators, executors, or trustees, having duties to perform in reference to property for their cestuis que trust, should deal with the beneficiaries with respect thereto, except upon the footing of the utmost candor and upon considerations demonstrative of the absence of any undue advantage.

       An executor cannot purchase property from himself, directly or indirectly, and if he does so the sale will be set aside at the instance of a legatee who is not in laches, however fair and honest it may have been. He may, however, purchase the property from a legatee who is sui juris and laboring under no disability, where all the circumstances of the transaction are fair and open, and no advantage is taken by him of the legatee by concealment, misrepresentation, or omission to state any important fact, or by the exercise or undue influence, and the legatee understands the nature and effect of his act.

       Court of appeals erred in granting an attorney's motion for summary judgment in the court's action to dissolve a partnership because the court cited disapproved language that the tort of wrongful dissolution of a partnership required the attempt to appropriate the "new prosperity" of the partnership; the gravamen of a wrongful dissolution claim is a partner's attempt to appropriate, through the dissolution, the assets or business of the partnership, which may include prospective business, without adequate compensation to the remaining partners.

       The relationship of principal and agent, being confidential and fiduciary in character, demands of the agent the utmost loyalty and good faith to his principal. Any breach of this good faith whereby the principal suffers any disadvantage and the agent reaps any benefit is a fraud of such nature as to preclude the agent from taking or retaining the benefit.

       - In response to a certified question asking whether, under Georgia law, a brokerage firm owed a fiduciary duty to the holder of a non-discretionary account, the supreme court answered that the fiduciary duties owed by a broker to a customer with a non-discretionary account were not restricted to the actual execution of transactions; the broker will generally have a heightened duty, even to the holder of a non-discretionary account, when recommending an investment which the holder has previously rejected or as to which the broker has a conflict of interest.

       - Where evidence is presented of a confidential relationship, the grantor being of weaker mentality and the grantee occupying the dominant position, an issue of fact is raised as to undue influence. Fletcher v. Fletcher, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 158</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 530</cite> (1978).
       </p>

       While a mere allegation of weakness of mind not amounting to imbecility is not sufficient to set forth a cause of action for cancellation of a deed, there being no allegation of fraud or undue influence, nevertheless, where the mental weakness is pronounced, such as would prevent the grantor from understanding the nature of his act at the time the deed was executed and especially where as alleged such mental impairment is united with alleged undue and controlling influence on the part of one occupying a confidential relationship with the illiterate grantor, it will authorize a cancellation on the ground of fraud. Mullins v. Barrett, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 11</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E.2d 842</cite> (1948).
       </p>

       Where the evidence and the pleadings show that the deceased was an infirm and aged woman, suffering from a brain tumor, whose mental and physical condition declined during the last years of her life, weakened by the damage to her brain by the illness from which she died, and that the defendants stood in a confidential and fiduciary capacity to her, whereby they administered her medicines to her and cared for her in her illness, took care of her personal business, hired nurses for her, cared for her in their home, and she changed her bank account to make it a joint one with her nephew, one of the defendants, there arose a presumption of undue influence, and the court should have charged on undue influence and the shifting of the burden of proof, and erred in failing to charge thereon. McGahee v. Walden, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 352</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 559</cite> (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court erred in giving a jury instruction that stated that the jury could infer that undue influence existed if it found a confidential relationship was present; the testator made a gift of realty, and the testator was in a weakened mental state and feeble-minded, so the jury was entitled under those circumstances to presume, not merely infer, that undue influence had been shown. White v. Regions Bank, <cite class="ga_court">275 Ga. 38</cite>, <cite class="app_court">561 S.E.2d 806</cite> (2002).
       </p>

       Evidence presented by a testator's child, which proved the testators's disease, medication, and its effects, the testator's dependence on the care givers, their isolation of the testator from the child; their active encouragement and arrangements for the drafting and execution of a new will, the testator's short-term relationship with them, the testator's sporadic contact with and lack of trust towards one of the challenged beneficiaries, and the testator's long-standing expressions of testamentary intent to leave all of the testator's property to the child, which the testator repeated the day after execution of the disposition, supplied sufficient evidence to support the child's claim of undue influence to support the jury verdict in the child's favor and not a directed verdict entered by the trial court in the face of this evidence; although this evidence did not demand a finding that the will was the product of undue influence, it was sufficient to authorize the submission of that question to the jury. Bailey v. Edmundson, <cite class="ga_court">280 Ga. 528</cite>, <cite class="app_court">630 S.E.2d 396</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A trial court correctly denied an executor's motion for directed verdict in an action wherein the child of the testator filed a caveat and objection to the probate of the testator's last will and testament on the grounds that the will was the product of undue influence as sufficient evidence existed to support the conclusion that undue influence was used to have the testator bequeath the only asset, namely a home, to the caregiver who was hired by the executor. The record established that the executor blocked calls from the testator's child, refused to let the child see the testator, and a confidential relationship was established between the caregiver and the testator as the caregiver took an active role in the planning, preparation, and execution of the will. Bean v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">283 Ga. 511</cite>, <cite class="app_court">661 S.E.2d 518</cite> (2008).

       A confidential relationship exists where one party occupies a position of trust and confidence with respect to another.
      
      Such a relationship can exist between an executor representing an estate of a decedent, and a legatee or devisee of the estate represented in administration. Ringer v. Lockhart, <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 82</cite>, <cite class="app_court">239 S.E.2d 349</cite> (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where the fiduciary relationship of principal and agent existed between the petitioner and the defendant, the latter could not make advantage or profit for himself out of the relationship to the injury of his principal. Harrison v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 214</cite> (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where a widow and named executrix under the will of a decedent, who is left a life estate in all of the property of the decedent, advises the sole nonresident remainderman named in the will that the father's estate would be handled fairly and that he would not have to worry about his father's estate, immediately, without actual notice to him applies for and obtains an uncontested year's support awarding to her all of the property of the decedent's estate, a question is presented, as to whether or not the year's support judgment was obtained by fraud. Ringer v. Lockhart, <cite class="ga_court">240 Ga. 82</cite>, <cite class="app_court">239 S.E.2d 349</cite> (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Under the evidence as to the existence of a partnership between the petitioner and the defendant and their agreement to jointly purchase the land involved, and evidence that the petitioner paid one-half of the purchase money and trusted the defendant to close the deal and obtain a conveyance naming them both as grantees, the defendant could not obtain an interest in the land antagonistic to that of the petitioner; and where the defendant procured a deed, in his own name only, equity would annul the conveyance and decree title in the petitioner to his share. Crosby v. Rogers, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 616</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 248</cite> (1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The relationship of principal and agent, being confidential and fiduciary in character, demands of the agent the utmost loyalty and good faith to his principal.
      
      Any breach of this good faith whereby the principal suffers any disadvantage and the agent reaps any benefit is a fraud of such nature as to preclude the agent from taking or retaining the benefit. Harrison v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 214</cite> (1958).

      Walker v. Hall, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 12</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E. 757</cite> (1932).

       When a litigant keeps the opposite party from court, equity will relieve against the judgment obtained in his absence.

       The mere failure of a party to disclose to the court or to his adversary matters which would defeat his own claim or defense is not such fraud
      
      as will justify or require a vacation of the judgment. Buice v. T. &amp; B. Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">219 Ga. 259</cite>, <cite class="app_court">132 S.E.2d 784</cite> (1963).

       A mere failure to comply with a promise on the part of a grantee is insufficient to establish fraudulent intent.
      
      However, where a petition alleges an oral promise by the grantee to perform an act in the future as the inducement or consideration for the execution of the deed by the grantor and where the promise is made with the present intention on the part of the grantee not to comply with it, the petition sets forth a cause of action for cancellation. Smith v. Merck, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 361</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1950); Sutton v. McMillan, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 139</cite> (1957); Hinson v.

       The mere failure to comply with a promise to perform an act in the future is not fraud in a legal sense.
      
      Hinson v. Hinson, <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 291</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E.2d 381</cite> (1965); Lanning v. Sockwell, <cite class="ga_app_court">137 Ga. App. 479</cite>, <cite class="app_court">224 S.E.2d 119</cite> (1976).

       <p>
      While the mere failure to comply with a promise is insufficient to establish an inceptive fraudulent intent, fraud will authorize equity to cancel and annul a deed no matter how solemnly executed.

       Fraud will authorize a court of equity to set aside a written instrument.

      When the failure to perform the promised act is coupled with the present intention not to perform, fraud, in the legal sense, is present. This is known as inceptive fraud, and is sufficient to support an action for cancellation of a written instrument. Hinson v. Hinson, <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 291</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E.2d 381</cite> (1965); Lanning v. Sockwell, <cite class="ga_app_court">137 Ga.

      Where it is alleged that the sole consideration for the execution of the deed from the grantor to the grantee is the promise of the grantees to support, maintain, provide, and care for a third party, and that this promise is made by the grantees fraudulently and for the purpose of securing the signature of the grantor, to the conveyance, and that the grantees never intend to comply with their agreement, the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action on the ground of inceptive fraud. Bucher v. Christopher, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 317</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 760</cite> (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Any representation, act, or artifice intended to deceive, and which does deceive another, is such a fraud as may authorize cancellation of a written contract, but a party to a contract who can read must read or show a legal excuse for not doing so, and ordinarily, if fraud is the excuse, it must be such fraud as prevents the party from reading; nor in such case will a mere fraudulent statement by the opposite party or his agent as to the contents of the writing furnish a legal excuse. And where the contract is a deed to land, the rule will generally apply to the grantee as well as the grantor. Livingston v. Barnett, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 640</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 385</cite> (1942).
      </p>
      <p>

      A cancellation obtained by fraud or mistake without payment may itself be canceled by equity. Grimmett v. Barnwell, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 191</cite> (1937); Lanning v. Sockwell, <cite class="ga_app_court">137 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      If the execution of the contract was merely one of the incidents or stages by which the deed plaintiff sought to cancel was procured, evidence tending to show that the contract itself was procured by fraud was admissible for the purpose of canceling the deed. Morton v. Wallace, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 856</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 720</cite> (1933).

      <p>
       <p>
      While the terms of an absolute deed cannot be varied by limiting the grantee to a use of the land in a manner not restricted by the express terms of the deed, it may nevertheless be alleged and proved that it was induced by fraud, without denying or varying any of the stipulations or conditions contained in the deed. Bucher v. Christopher, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 317</cite>, <cite class="app_court">85 S.E.2d 760</cite> (1955).

      Where land is owned by two persons, and one obtains a deed from the other to his interest by means of an intentionally false and fraudulent promise to sell the land at its true value and pay off an encumbrance and account for the balance, or failing to find a purchaser, he will procure a new loan to discharge the present encumbrance, and after obtaining the title he retains and claims the property as absolutely his own, this transaction by which the ownership is obtained is such a fraud as will entitle the grantor to have the deed canceled. Smith v. Merck, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 361</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1950).

      Equity will grant relief where the transfer of a valuable property has been fraudulently extorted, for a grossly inadequate consideration, from a person while in such a state of intoxication as to render him incapable of transacting business.

      Where a party at the time of entering into a contract or executing an instrument is intoxicated to such a degree as to deprive him of his reason and to disqualify his mind to apprehend the nature of his act and its probable consequences, a court of equity may grant relief by rescission and cancellation. McKaig v. Hardy, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 11</cite> (1943); Ealy v.

      As against one who by fraud during the lifetime of deceased husband induced the latter to execute to him a deed to realty, equity will afford the widow, as personal representative, a remedy to cancel and set aside the deed and incidentally to preserve and apply rents issuing from such realty.

       Equity has jurisdiction to reform written instruments where there has been a mistake
      
      on the part of one of the parties, accompanied by fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of the other party, just as in cases where there is a mutual mistake. Thompson v. Thompson, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 128</cite>, <cite class="app_court">45 S.E.2d 632</cite> (1947); Wellborn v.

      Petition contained sufficient allegations to show mistake on the part of the petitioner and fraud on the part of her own attorney, known to the attorney for the husband, and alleged a cause of action for reformation of contract between the parties and for modification of the judgment in the divorce suit accordingly.

       The general rule that an infant is bound by a judgment rendered in a suit in which he is represented by a next friend,
      
      to the same extent as though he were an adult, is subject to an exception in case of fraud, collusion, or like conduct on the part of the next friend, in which case the judgment may be set aside at the instance of the minor, even though it may be a consent judgment. Nelson v. Estill, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1940).
      </p>

       <p>
      A decree adversely affecting the interests of minors, even though it be entered by consent of their father as next friend, may, if induced by fraud, duress, or the like, be set aside at their instance in a proper proceeding, and for that purpose they may sue by their mother as next friend. Nelson v. Estill, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1940).

       As between the original parties thereto, fraud in its procurement voids a contract,
      
      and this upon the theory that, the consent of the parties being necessary to the binding force of a contract, if one, apparently consenting by the execution of a written contract, can show that he did not in fact consent to its terms as therein expressed, but that his apparent consent was induced by false and fraudulent practices, by means of which he was overreached by the other party, and, without negligence upon his own part, really deceived as to the terms of the contract, he would be entitled to be relieved from its apparent obligations. McKaig v. Hardy, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 582</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 11</cite> (1943).

       Possession retained by the vendor, after an absolute sale of real or personal property, is prima facie evidence of fraud,

         An accounting may be had at law.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The mere necessity of accounting to ascertain the amount due on a contract is insufficient to give equity jurisdiction to order an accounting. Insurance Ctr., Inc. v. Hamilton, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 597</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 801</cite> (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Therefore, an equitable accounting is not a proceeding to which every litigant has a right.
       
       It is granted only in carefully prescribed and determined circumstances, such as when an accounting at law is inadequate, and when the relationships and dealings between the parties are as set forth in this section. Herring v. Standard Guar. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">238 Ga. 261</cite>, <cite class="app_court">232 S.E.2d 544</cite> (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An equitable accounting is evidentiary in nature
       
       but the determination that an equitable accounting will be ordered is an interlocutory or preliminary matter separate and distinct from the equitable accounting itself. Herring v. Standard Guar. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">238 Ga. 261</cite>, <cite class="app_court">232 S.E.2d 544</cite> (1977).

       - Because there were no excess proceeds from the foreclosure sale to which a condominium association would have been entitled, and regardless of whether it was the owner of the condominium at the time of the foreclosure it was not entitled to an equitable accounting, the association was also properly denied attorney fees under O.C.G.A.

Ass'n v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 7</cite>, <cite class="app_court">645 S.E.2d 5</cite> (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1254, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 705 (Ga. 2007).

        <p>

        This section contemplates only petitions in equity involving the traditional filing of the action
       
       and the issuance and service of process. Bodrey v. Bodrey, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 822</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 614</cite> (1969), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Wiley v. Wiley, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 824</cite>, <cite class="app_court">213 S.E.2d 682</cite> (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Hence, equity does not have jurisdiction merely because the application for partition prays for an accounting
       
       as to common grantors where there was no filing of an action and summons and process. Bodrey v. Bodrey, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 822</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E.2d 614</cite> (1969), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Wiley v. Wiley, <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 824</cite>, <cite class="app_court">213 S.E.2d 682</cite> (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where a fiduciary relation exists, an accounting in equity is proper.
       
       Atlanta Trust Co. v. National Bondholders Corp., <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 644</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        So, where petitioners, remainder legatees under their mother's will, sued defendant in three different capacities,
       
       namely, as trustee for the life estate under the will, as executrix, and as an individual, seeking an injunction against the sale of realty of the estate, partition, judgment, an accounting, and other and further relief, petitioners were entitled to an accounting. Matson v. Crowe, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 578</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 288</cite> (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In a proceeding to obtain an accounting, the complainant is not obliged to show how much is due,
       
       provided he avers facts sufficient to indicate that something will be found to be due him by the defendant. Atlanta Trust Co. v. National Bondholders Corp., <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 761</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 644</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An injunction may be granted to continue during an accounting.

        <p>
       - Where it appears from a petition praying for an accounting that there was pending in another court an action by the corporate defendant against the plaintiff, such court being empowered to render an accounting between the parties, and no special reason being set out why a court of equity should assume jurisdiction for such purpose, equity will not enjoin the proceedings and processes of a court of law in the absence of some intervening equity or other proper defense of which the party, without fault on his part, cannot avail himself at law. Peeples v. Peeples, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 358</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 629</cite> (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There must be some special reason why a court proceeding in equity should take charge of an action
       
       where an accounting is requested, the petition must show, and this means more than the mere assertion of a conclusion, some reason why the remedy at law is inadequate. Peeples v. Peeples, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 358</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 629</cite> (1942).

       - A suit for an accounting case, on appeal, must be transferred to the Court of Appeals from the Supreme Court, where the alleged facts show no unusual complication in the transactions or other ground for equitable relief additional to the relief which might be afforded by an accounting and judgment at law.

        Borrower was not entitled to an equitable accounting because the borrower failed to allege facts sufficient to show that the borrower lacked an adequate remedy at law to ascertain the amount due on the borrower's loan. Phillips v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where a number of cotenants are in possession of all of the common property, and are collecting the rents and profits thereof, an equitable action for partitioning and accounting by those not in possession of the property is a proper remedy. Bailey v. Bell, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 566</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 881</cite> (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Accounting between cotenants for a just share of the profits is applicable
       
       where a partition of the land is granted. Turnbull v. Foster, <cite class="ga_court">116 Ga. 765</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E. 42</cite> (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A court may entertain a partition proceeding without trying first, or in connection therewith, a suit for accounting
       
       concerning the same property held in cotenancy. Lankford v. Milhollin, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 197</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And it is within the power of the court to order a sale of the common property
       
       prior to the trial of the main accounting suit. Whether such partition proceeding is heard before the trial of the suit for accounting is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the court. Lankford v. Milhollin, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 197</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        While equity jurisdiction ceases where the Legislature gives a specific remedy at law,
       
       and while a specific legal remedy for partition is provided by Subpart 2, Part 2, Art. 7, Ch. 6, T. 44, and under
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.44.html#t44c06s44-6-140" target="_blank">44-6-140</a></cite> equity will not ordinarily take cognizance of a partition proceeding unless the remedy at law is insufficient, or peculiar circumstances render the proceeding in equity more suitable and just, accounting between tenants in common will alone and of itself give a court of equity jurisdiction of a partition proceeding, whether or not there are other peculiar circumstances which render the proceeding in equity more suitable and just. Mills v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 425</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 212</cite> (1951).

       - In an action by tenants' insurers against suppliers of building materials for losses due to fire damage to the building, the suppliers did not have a right to contribution from the landlord since the tenants and the landlord had agreed in leases not to sue each other before for losses covered by insurance; thus, no cause of action by the insurers against the landlord ever arose and the landlord could not be a joint tort-feasor with the suppliers.

        While the doctrine of contribution originated in courts of equity, it was subsequently adopted by courts of law
       
       and is now universally applied therein. In order to make the doctrine consistent with the forms, theories, and practices of courts of law, the fiction of an implied contract by one obligor to contribute to another coobligor who had been compelled to pay the whole obligation was adopted. Watkins v. Woodbery, <cite class="ga_court">148 Ga. 249</cite>, <cite class="app_court">96 S.E. 338</cite> (1918); Powell v.

         There is no line of separation between the liability of joint tort-feasors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The tort is a thing integral and indivisible, and any claim for injuries arising therefrom runs through and embraces every part of the tort. The liability of one cannot be carried into any portion of the joint tort that is not followed by an equal liability of the other tort-feasor. Eidson v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 641</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 895</cite> (1943).

       </p>

        <p>

        And, it does not lie in the mouth of petitioner to claim contribution when it has paid nothing
       
       upon the alleged joint obligation. Autry v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">167 Ga. 136</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E. 741</cite> (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        However, it is unnecessary to show that a common debt has been paid in full
       
       either by the plaintiff or by any other person. In some decisions there are expressions which might imply that the whole debt must be paid before an action for contribution will lie, but such was not the rule at common law, nor is there any such requirement under this Code. Herrington v. Wimberly, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 536</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 670</cite> (1933).

       Trial court properly granted partial summary judgment to the former business partners on the separate entity partners' counterclaim that the separate entity partners were owed money due to the former business partners' alleged failure to pay their share of a settlement agreement entered into after a franchiser filed separate suits seeking unpaid royalties; nothing of record showed that either of the separate entity partners paid any portion of the settlement and, in fact, the record showed that the corporation formed by the former business partners and the separate entity partners paid it. Carter v. Parish, <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">616 S.E.2d 877</cite> (2005).

       - When a principal obligor with his own funds pays a joint debt due by him and a coprincipal, the right of the former upon the implied contract of the latter to bear his share of the common burden arises when the one paying the joint debt extinguishes the debt of their common debtor.

        Even after the dissolution of a partnership, the statute of limitations does not begin to run
       
       in favor of one partner against another until the partnership affairs, as to debtors and creditors of the firm, have been wound up and settled, or, at least, a sufficient time has elapsed since the dissolution to raise the presumption that such was the fact, nor, while there are outstanding assets and liabilities, will a partner be barred as against his copartner on the principle of stale demands. Powell v. Powell, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 840</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 677</cite> (1931), later appeal, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 817</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 566</cite> (1934).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - The general rule is that one who is compelled to pay or satisfy the whole or to bear more than his just share of a common burden or obligation, upon which several persons are equally liable or which they are bound to discharge, is entitled to contribution against the others to obtain from them payment of their respective shares. Eidson v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 641</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 895</cite> (1943); Horton v. Continental Cas. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 594</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 605</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Coobligors on notes or other obligations for payment of money are equally bound,
       
       and must equally contribute to the discharge of such an obligation, and one of the joint makers who pays more than his share of the obligation may enforce contribution from any of his joint obligors who fails or refuses to discharge his aliquot proportion of the joint liability, but inequality of benefits or interest between coobligors may destroy equality of contribution between them, and a variance between the amounts of their primary liability to the common creditor may have the same effect; thus, where the several coobligors on a promissory note receive different amounts on account of the note, they are liable to contribute, not equally, but in proportion to the amount received by each of them. Davis v. Perkins, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 195</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 562</cite> (1934).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c02s23-2-71" target="_self">23-2-71</a></cite> distinguish between a co-debtor, who is entitled to contribution upon payment of the debt, and a surety, who is legally subrogated to the rights of the creditor and is entitled to sue on the original indebtedness upon payment of the debt.

        <p>
       - The permission to have contribution "where all are equally bound to bear the common burden, and one has paid more than his share," is absolutely unrestricted. Southern Ry. v. City of Rome, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 449</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E. 7</cite> (1934); Horton v. Continental Cas. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 594</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 605</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Contribution has been defined to be a payment made by each, or by any,
       
       or several having a common interest of liability of his share in the loss suffered, or in the money necessarily paid by one of the parties in behalf of the others. It is the right of one who has discharged a common liability or burden to recover of another also liable the aliquot portion which he ought to pay or bear. Eidson v. Maddox, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 641</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 895</cite> (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In case of insolvency of a surety the solvent sureties must bear equally the burden of payment.
       
       Todd v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 438</cite> (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        There is no authority which allows a cosurety to convert his action for contribution into something else
       
       merely by founding his action on the original evidence of indebtedness. It is still a suit to enforce contribution from cosureties, and plaintiff is bound by the substantive rules pertaining to contribution. Todd v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 438</cite> (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It is not some independent right but the right to contribution which is being enforced,
       
       and it is an action on the original evidence of indebtedness by way of subrogation to the creditor's remedy which is allowed to the surety merely as a form of action in aid of the right to contribution from cosureties. Todd v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 438</cite> (1968).

         Sureties' liability for contribution several and not joint.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Since the substantive right and liability being enforced is that of contribution between coobligors, each is liable only for an equal proportionate share of the debt. This liability is several and not joint, and a joint obligor who has paid the joint obligation is entitled to judgment against each of his coobligors only for the proportion for which each is liable; judgment should not be entered against any one of them or against all of them jointly for the aggregate amount due from them. Todd v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 438</cite> (1968).

       - There is no authority for the proposition that a surety or other coobligor, however he may find his action for contribution, may obtain a joint and several judgment against his several cosureties for the aggregate amount due him. Todd v. Windsor, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 438</cite> (1968).

       - If there be several guarantors, some of whom have paid off the obligation, their right against the remaining guarantors, or persons secondarily liable, is only for contribution as to the proportionate share of the whole. Auerback v. Maslia, <cite class="ga_app_court">142 Ga. App. 184</cite>, <cite class="app_court">235 S.E.2d 594</cite> (1977).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where separate judgments are entered against tort-feasors whose concurrent, independent negligence results in damage to the plaintiff's property, the verdict and judgment against each tort-feasor adjudicates the amount of his liability. In such circumstances there is no right of contribution between the tort-feasors. The right of contribution under the law is based upon one party bearing more than his share of "a common burden." Hardwick v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">100 Ga. App. 38</cite>, <cite class="app_court">110 S.E.2d 24</cite> (1959).

       - Where the business of a copartnership entails loss and where no part of the copartnership debts has been paid, no right of contribution arises, and no right to setoff partnership liabilities against a suit on a note by one of the partners against the other partners. Brinson v. Franklin, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 727</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 287</cite> (1933).

       The right of setoff did not originally exist at common law,
      
      and before Ch. 7, T. 13 it was cognizable only in a court proceeding in equity. Robinson v. Lindsey, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 684</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 910</cite> (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The right to set off one legal demand against another, other than in cases covered by Ch. 7, T. 13, is an equitable right,
      
      which is not and has never been recognized by a court of law in this state, except in obedience to a statute, and therefore it can be asserted only in a court having jurisdiction in equity matters. Quitman Cooperage Co. v. People's First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 17</cite> (1933); Gormley ex rel. Citizens Bank v. Chance, <cite class="ga_app_court">55 Ga. App. 838</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E. 701</cite> (1937); Autry v. Palmour, <cite class="ga_app_court">124 Ga. App. 407</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E.2d 15</cite> (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The right of a court in this state to exercise equitable jurisdiction to enforce a setoff extends to cases where there is an intervening equity
      
      not reached by the law, or where the setoff is of an equitable nature. Quitman Cooperage Co. v. People's First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 17</cite> (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Nonresidence of the plaintiff is an intervening equity.
      
      Gordy Tire Co. v. Dayton Rubber Co., <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 83</cite>, <cite class="app_court">114 S.E.2d 529</cite> (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       And insolvency is one of the intervening equities
      
      contemplated by this section. McLendon v. Galloway, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 261</cite>, <cite class="app_court">116 S.E.2d 208</cite> (1960); Autry v. Palmour, <cite class="ga_app_court">124 Ga. App. 407</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E.2d 15</cite> (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       However, there are decisions that recognize that plaintiff's nonresidence alone will warrant the exercise of equitable jurisdiction.
      
      Aetna Ins. Co. v. Lunsford, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 716</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 727</cite> (1934).

      of which the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction. Robinson v. Lindsey, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 684</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 910</cite> (1937).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where affirmative defense to action is beyond jurisdiction of city or county court in which it was filed, and plaintiff in that court is nonresident or insolvent so that failure to adjudicate counterclaim urged by original defendant along with main case could result in unfair advantage, superior court may exercise its equitable powers by enjoining suit originally filed and taking cognizance of entire controversy in a single action. Lester v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where, neither nonresidence nor insolvency of original plaintiff is urged,
       
       and there is no showing either that such plaintiff corporation is nonresident or, if so, that it has no agent for service within state, no case has been made out for exercise of equity jurisdiction. Arnold v. Carter, <cite class="ga_court">125 Ga. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E. 177</cite> (1906); Lester v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 143</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        However, insolvency and nonresidence are not the sole grounds of equitable setoff; they are illustrative,
       
       but not all-comprehensive, of such grounds and an equitable setoff will be allowed, although the amount is small, and although the party may have a remedy at law, if to recover that small amount he is driven to many suits and to much trouble and expense. Quitman Cooperage Co. v. People's First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 17</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The character of the demand does not determine the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the plea
       
       of setoff. Quitman Cooperage Co. v. People's First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 90</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 17</cite> (1933).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Existence of valid right of setoff does not operate to defeat plaintiff's claim, although it might preclude his recovery of any actual damages; and this is true regardless of the assertion of the setoff as a legal right or an equitable right. National City Bank v. Busbin, <cite class="ga_app_court">175 Ga. App. 103</cite>, <cite class="app_court">332 S.E.2d 678</cite> (1985); Gynecologic Oncology v.

       <p>
        <p>

        Equity may allow a setoff to prevent a multiplicity of suits.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Damages arising ex delicto cannot be set off against a cause of action ex contractu, except upon equitable grounds.
       
       Such decisions, however, are based upon general equitable principles, and not upon statute. Harden v. Lang, <cite class="ga_court">110 Ga. 392</cite>, <cite class="app_court">36 S.E. 100</cite> (1900); Aetna Ins. Co. v. Lunsford, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 716</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 727</cite> (1934); McLendon v.

       Where petitioner, a nonresident railroad, brought an action ex contractu against a resident of this state for the collection of freight charges owing the petitioner, and by counterclaim the defendant set off an action ex delicto for negligence, a court of equity will take jurisdiction thereof, under this section, and the Supreme Court has jurisdiction of the writ of error (see

       - Trial court erred in ruling for a development company in the company's declaratory judgment action seeking to have the company's debt to a bank set off against the company's loan to a holding company because the bank and the holding company were separate entities; the development company knew the risks involved when the company made the holding company loan, and the bank could not obtain relief unavailable to any other entities who lent money to the holding company simply because the company borrowed money from the bank years ago.

        - Defendant's claim that she satisfied her debt on a promissory note owed to her spouse by providing her mother-in-law with a rent-free apartment and by paying certain debts that spouse owed to certain creditors was to no avail as it was done under a mere volunteer arrangement with no outstanding obligations to do so.

        A city court has no jurisdiction whatever to entertain a plea setting up an equitable setoff,
       
       or an equitable right of setoff, for the simple reason that to entertain such a plea it is necessary for the court, not only to recognize an equitable right, but to give affirmative relief as a result of such recognition. Jones v. George S. Riley, Jr. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">14 Ga. App. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E. 341</cite> (1913); Gormley ex rel. Citizens Bank v.

        Where an employee had been wrongfully and unlawfully discharged, the employer must pay all of his pay
       
       and allowances up until, and including day of discharge minus compensation of other concurrent work. Russell v. Hughes, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 634</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 584</cite> (1979).

        The discharged servant is bound to use due diligence to prevent the loss from being more than necessary,
       
       and to that end must seek employment in similar business and derive such income from it as he reasonably can, which is to be deducted in fixing the damage to be recovered; the burden, however, of showing that he did obtain employment, or could have obtained it by due diligence, is on the other party.

       This section refers to an action to regulate administrations.
      
      It has no reference to withdrawing the administration altogether from the court of ordinary (now probate court) in order that a superior court may administer the estate, except where the administration in the court of ordinary (now probate court) originated in fraud or is being fraudulently exercised.

         Proceeding against administrator, etc., for settlement of estate not interference with regular administration of estate.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - A proceeding brought against an administrator or executor for a settlement by an heir at law or legatee is not such interference with the regular administration of estates as is denounced by this section. The jurisdiction of a court of ordinary (now probate court) and a superior court in respect to bringing proceedings for an account and settlement is co-ordinate and equal, and has always been so in this state. The jurisdiction conferred upon the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the management and distribution of estates does not oust the jurisdiction of equity in matters of settlement. Terry v. Chandler, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E. 572</cite> (1931); Stroup v. Imes, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 422</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E. 411</cite> (1938); Robinson v. Georgia Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 688</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 395</cite> (1938); Manry v.

        And a court first taking jurisdiction will "retain it,

       <p>
        <p>
       - A superior court will not interfere with the regular course of an administrator, by appointing a receiver to take the assets of the estate out of the hands of the administrator, unless the danger is imminent and the charges in the complaint are positive and specific. Griner v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 592</cite> (1935); Furr v. Jordan, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 862</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 861</cite> (1943); Salter v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - While it would now appear that there are decisions holding that ordinarily an equitable petition for an accounting against an administrator may be maintained without the necessity of showing imminent danger of loss, where it does not appear that the court of ordinary (now probate court) has already assumed jurisdiction for the purpose of an accounting, this rule will not be extended to a case which shows plainly that an accounting would be premature. Hoffman v. Chester, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 296</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E.2d 760</cite> (1948).

         Full protection of rights of parties in interest compels interference by courts.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Superior courts are loath to interfere in the administration of estates; but having concurrent jurisdiction with the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the settlement of accounts, they will not hesitate to interfere for the full protection of the rights of parties in interest. Hamrick v. Prewett, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 895</cite>, <cite class="app_court">164 S.E. 678</cite> (1932); Jones v. Proctor, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 607</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 779</cite> (1943); Spence v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 566</cite>, <cite class="app_court">32 S.E.2d 297</cite> (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And to authorize interference the facts must clearly show there is a good reason for so doing.
       
       Gaines v. Gaines, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 169</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E. 883</cite> (1930); Griner v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 592</cite> (1935); Butler v. Floyd, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 447</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E. 460</cite> (1937); Furr v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And, to authorize interference in estate, the facts must very clearly show there is a good reason for so doing.
       
       Marlowe v. Moss, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 781</cite>, <cite class="app_court">95 S.E.2d 796</cite> (1956).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where devisee brings equitable complaint against coexecutors of an estate, seeking a partition of the property of the estate through a sale by the receiver, and alleging that more than 20 years had elapsed since the executors had qualified, that all the debts of the estate had been paid, and that executors were in possession of all real and personal property belonging to the estate, the allegations are insufficient to authorize the grant of the prayers for equitable complaint between the devisees because plaintiff devisee has a full and adequate remedy under the law in the court of ordinary (now probate court) to require executors to distribute the estate by division or partition. Salter v. Salter, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 511</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 241</cite> (1953).

        <p>
       - An injunction will not lie against real estate agents joined as parties defendant for diversion of rent from property devised to the plaintiffs by the testator in the absence of any showing that the executor is not amenable to and cannot be made to respond to any future order of the ordinary (now probate court judge) holding him responsible, since no reason would appear to disturb the orderly procedure of the court having and exercising jurisdiction. Bowen v. Bowen, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 572</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 797</cite> (1946).

        <p>
       - By consenting to the continuation of a temporary restraining order and to a consent order, defendants consented to an injunction against themselves, thereby at least temporarily conceding that the superior court had jurisdiction, i.e., that plaintiffs had no adequate remedy at law. Vowell v. Carmichael, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 732</cite> (1975).

       - The defense available in equity that the complainant has an adequate remedy at law must be raised before the decree is entered; otherwise, this defense is waivable. Vowell v. Carmichael, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 387</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 732</cite> (1975).

        <p>
       - Hence, a complaint by a legatee alleging that the application for administration pending before the ordinary (now probate judge), was not filed in good faith, will be dismissed. McArthur v.

        And a complaint will be dismissed where it merely alleges that the administrator has paid an improper item,

      <p>
       <p>

       General rule is that only the legal representative of an estate may apply to a court of equitable jurisdiction for direction or construction of a will.
      
      The only exception to this rule is upon application of a person interested in the estate where there is danger of loss or other injury to his interest. Campbell v. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 37</cite>, <cite class="app_court">28 S.E.2d 471</cite> (1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Under the provisions of this section, only the representative of the estate may seek the direction of a court for the construction of a will. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 483</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 769</cite> (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The court in a proper case might entertain a suit by executors for direction,
      
      and still appoint receivers to execute directions given therein; the two powers of the court are given equal recognition in the Code, and are not antagonistic, but are coordinate and consistent. Benton v. Turk, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 710</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 580</cite> (1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       An executor is entitled to the direction of the courts of Georgia and to the aid of equity
      
      in the settlement of his accounts in the performance of his duties and the fulfillment of his oath if a proper case for same is alleged. Georgia Money Corp. v. Rissman, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 476</cite>, <cite class="app_court">139 S.E.2d 486</cite> (1964).

       <p>
        <p>
       - An action seeking recovery of property devised by a will, in which a construction of the will is sought as a basis for such recovery, is not maintainable in equity, where it is not alleged that the executor has assented to the devise or wrongfully refuses to assent. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 483</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 769</cite> (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A legatee or devisee cannot under normal circumstances maintain a complaint for construction of a will,
       
       since that is the duty and prerogative of the executor yet, the right of a legatee or devisee, under stated circumstances, to seek and obtain construction is recognized. Brewton v. McLeod, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 686</cite>, <cite class="app_court">119 S.E.2d 105</cite> (1961); Lowell v. Bouchillon, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 357</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 498</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And a superior court will not obstruct the orderly procedure of an application for year's support before the judge of the probate court, by assuming jurisdiction under the guise of construing the will;
       
       especially where the executor, who is the only proper party for a petition for construction, is not the plaintiff in the petition, but is named as a party defendant by legatees under the will. Bowen v. Bowen, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 572</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 797</cite> (1946).

       - Where legatee sought by her complaint and was entitled to injunctive relief against the executor to prevent a premature distribution of the assets of the estate contrary to the directions of the will, and alleged that the executor had misconstrued the will, legatee's petition showed such interest by the legatee in the estate and such necessity for construction of the will and direction by the court to protect her distributive share and legacy as would authorize her to bring the action.

       - Executor of the estate and partnership head faced uncertainty with respect to conflicting duties to the partnership and to the estate and beneficiaries; thus, a declaratory judgment was an appropriate vehicle to clarify the executor's obligations, and the Georgia superior court had concurrent jurisdiction with the probate court to address those issues as well as was authorized to exercise the court's concurrent and equitable jurisdiction to decide the requests for the temporary restraining orders.

        Upon application of any person interested in the estate, where there is danger of loss or other injury to his interest, a superior court will entertain jurisdiction.

        But a person may not seek intervention of equity as a means of wrenching administration of the estate from the jurisdiction of the court of ordinary
       
       (now probate court). Jones v. Head, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 857</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 725</cite> (1938); Conner v. Yawn, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 500</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E.2d 541</cite> (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Fact that an executor is serving without bond is insufficient to show a danger of loss or injury
       
       in the absence of interference by a court of equity. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 483</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E.2d 769</cite> (1949); Fuller v. Fuller, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 691</cite>, <cite class="app_court">124 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1962).

       <p>
        <p>
       - The superior courts are not ordinarily empowered on equitable complaint to set aside a previous probate of a will by a court of ordinary (now probate court), or to pass upon the validity of a will, or to interfere with due administration already in progress in a court of ordinary, or to do more than determine the legality or proper construction of particular legacies. Abercrombie v. Hair, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 728</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 447</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        One clear exception to this section is where fraud has been or is being committed by the executor.
       
       In such cases it is deemed that the only complete and adequate remedy to which the heirs, legatees, or devisees may be entitled can only be afforded by a court exercising equitable jurisdiction. King v. King, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 142</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E.2d 347</cite> (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Hence, where a legatee alleges fraud, and seeks cancellation and rescission of a deed
       
       executed by the defendant executor conveying property belonging to the estate to the executor's wife, the superior court is authorized to take necessary action for the complete and just administration of the estate in one action. King v. King, <cite class="ga_court">225 Ga. 142</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E.2d 347</cite> (1969).

       - However, "the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be set aside by a decree in equity, for fraud, accident, or mistake." The fraud in the procurement of such a judgment must have been actual and positive, done with knowledge, and not merely constructive fraud, committed in ignorance of the true facts. Thus a superior court may set aside as void a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) appointing an administrator where "an allegation of fact in a petition of the court of ordinary (now probate court), which was necessary to give the court jurisdiction, was known by the petitioner to be false, and therefore was fraud upon the court."

        <p>
       - Paragraph (2) of this section is not intended, in the absence of any allegation of fraud, to supply a means of reviewing a judgment of the court of ordinary (now probate court) in the administration of an estate of which it has assumed jurisdiction, or of ousting the jurisdiction of the court of ordinary (now probate court). Darby v. Green, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 146</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E. 493</cite> (1932).

       If an insolvent executor in charge of real estate which includes houses which need repairs, no matter however small, and he, being without sufficient funds to make them, fails to do so, and on this account the property is deteriorating, the persons to whom the property has been devised are entitled to have the same protected, and the appointment of a receiver with directions to him to have the repairs made, seems not to be an inappropriate remedy. Jones v. Proctor, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 607</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 779</cite> (1943).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where wife of the deceased testator alleges that the executor refuses to give her any information concerning the money or property belonging to the estate, which information she must have in order to determine the question whether or not to accept a bequest contained in the will in lieu of dower and a year's support, widow was a "person interested in the estate" and entitled to maintain action in equity against executor.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And, where minor children of testator participate in the residue of the estate after specific bequests have been satisfied,
       
       and all persons provided for in the will with the exception of the children were granted their legacies in the probate court, children qualified under statute as "person interested in estate," and were entitled to appointment of receiver to restrain executor and others from disposing of estate property. Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 470</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 602</cite> (1950).

       - This provision requires a determination of whether plaintiffs, as persons interested in the estate because they are parties to a testamentary agreement, made sufficient allegations as to "danger of loss or other injury to their interests" when there is no application from the representative.

       The court might entertain an action by executors for direction, and still appoint receivers to execute directions
      
      given therein; the two powers of the court are given equal recognition in the Code, and are not antagonistic, but are coordinate and consistent. Benton v. Turk, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 710</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 580</cite> (1939).

       And a widow can maintain action against her coexecutors in her representative capacity as executrix, but not in her individual capacity
      
      as legatee, widow and sole heir at law of testator; she can maintain action as executrix even though, since she has a manifest interest in the subject matter of the action, a decree will also adjudicate her claim as legatee, widow and heir at law. Armstrong v. Merts, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 483</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E.2d 512</cite> (1947).

       - Where legatee sought by her complaint and was entitled to injunctive relief against the executor to prevent a premature distribution of the assets of the estate contrary to the directions of the will, and alleged that the executor had misconstrued the will, legatee's complaint showed such interest by the legatee in the estate and such necessity for construction of the will and direction by the court to protect her distributive share and legacy as would authorize her to bring the action. Barfield v. Aiken, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 483</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E.2d 100</cite> (1953).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Executor of the estate and partnership head faced uncertainty with respect to conflicting duties to the partnership and to the estate and beneficiaries; thus, a declaratory judgment was an appropriate vehicle to clarify the executor's obligations, and the Georgia superior court had concurrent jurisdiction with the probate court to address those issues as well as was authorized to exercise the court's concurrent and equitable jurisdiction to decide the requests for the temporary restraining orders. Rentz v. Rentz, <cite class="ga_app_court">339 Ga. App. 66</cite>, <cite class="app_court">793 S.E.2d 112</cite> (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In a complaint by an executor for construction of a will, all persons named as legatees are proper parties.
       
       Watts v. Finley, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 629</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 723</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        However, a person who claims an interest in the estate, not arising under the will, is not a party
       
       to a complaint for direction. Bond v. Connelly, <cite class="ga_court">8 Ga. 302</cite> (1850).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where interveners are not claiming under the will but, their claim is antagonistic to the will,
       
       and they are claiming under the will of another, then the issue presents none of the questions included within the provisions of this section. Phillips v. Kelly, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 111</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 281</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A superior court will not construe a will when requested by the executor "on imaginary difficulties or from excessive caution."
       
       Venable v. Dallas, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 595</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E.2d 416</cite> (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Therefore, complaint seeking a declaratory judgment, which shows that the complainant was not uncertain or insecure as to his asserted rights as executor as against the claim of a legatee, was properly dismissed on demurrer (now motion to dismiss). Venable v. Dallas, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 595</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E.2d 416</cite> (1956).

       However, where one item of a will contained a bequest of "twenty thousand ($20,000.00) dollars," and another item a bequest to the "University Hospital of Augusta, Georgia," there being no such legal entity in the said city, the executors of such will were authorized to bring in a superior court a complaint seeking construction and direction. Moss v. Youngblood, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">200 S.E. 689</cite> (1938).

        Also, a superior court will not assume jurisdiction of an estate and obstruct the procedure for the administration
       
       of an estate under the guise of construing the will. Bandy v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 192</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 449</cite> (1954).

       - An executor who seeks the aid of a superior court and invokes a construction of the will with whose execution he has been charged by a testator will not be heard to retract his statement that the will requires construction, and mend his hold by contending, in substance, that the contents of the will are so plain as to require no construction, nor can an executor in such circumstances advocate or promote the interest of any party other than himself, in any litigation involving the construction of the will.

        If a widow is entitled to a year's support, there is no cause, legal or equitable, for delaying enjoyment
       
       of this right; and if it cannot be asserted against the executor, he can defend himself at law upon his title as executor, and has no need for an injunction. Smith v. Pitchford, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">5 S.E.2d 766</cite> (1939).

       - Though it is the rule that a direct proceeding to construe a will must be brought in a superior court, where the construction of a will is incidentally involved in a proceeding over which the probate court has jurisdiction, the probate court has jurisdiction under such conditions to interpret the will so far as may be necessary in the proceedings before it.

       This section grants the right to an administrator to marshal the assets in equity
      
      where an estate is insolvent, and he is harassed by actions at law by creditors. Johnson v. Flanders, <cite class="ga_court">65 Ga. 691</cite> (1880).

       The existence of a constructive trust is not always necessary to confer jurisdiction.

       However, creditors with superior claims, which are not disputed cannot be joined
      
      in the petition. Green v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">45 Ga. 205</cite> (1872); Turk v. Ross, <cite class="ga_court">59 Ga. 378</cite> (1877); Herrington v. Tolbert, <cite class="ga_court">110 Ga. 528</cite>, <cite class="app_court">35 S.E. 687</cite> (1900).

       Where executor carried on the business of the decedent for a year, a petition may be maintained

       This section does not confine the right to bring a creditor's petition to instances where one has a lien,
      
      or has reduced the claim to judgment. Stephens v. Whitehead, <cite class="ga_court">75 Ga. 294</cite> (1885); Steele Lumber Co. v. Laurens Lumber Co., <cite class="ga_court">98 Ga. 329</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E. 755</cite> (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The nature of a creditors' petition is a proceeding in rem,
      
      and any person in interest may come in before disposition of the fund. Minnehan &amp; Hazlehurst v. Brunswick &amp; A.R.R., <cite class="ga_court">52 Ga. 248</cite> (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       But the burden is upon the creditor to contradict the priorities as arranged in the decree.
      
      Gray v. Perry, <cite class="ga_court">51 Ga. 180</cite> (1874).
      </p>

       An exemption set apart to a bankrupt may be reached by creditors holding notes containing waivers
      
      of exemption. Peppers v. Cauthen, <cite class="ga_court">143 Ga. 229</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E. 477</cite> (1915).

       - An assignment by a bank of its effects to which the creditors are not parties or consenting, cannot deprive them of the right to maintain a petition, under this section. Schley v. Dixon, <cite class="ga_court">24 Ga. 273</cite>, 71 Am. Dec. 121 (1858).

        Creditors of an insolvent corporation may unite in the same petition
       
       to charge the stockholders, who were also directors, for fraudulently abstracting the capital stock of the bank. Semmes v. Mott, <cite class="ga_court">27 Ga. 92</cite> (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A decree that the debtor's money be paid into court will follow where a defendant in a creditors' petition admits that he has such funds.
       
       Rutherford v. Jones, <cite class="ga_court">26 Ga. 150</cite> (1858).
       </p>
       <p>

        Prior to the decree, the defendant may tender satisfaction and compel the creditor to accept it.

        Creditors can bring a petition in equity to reach the interest of a beneficiary under a trust
       
       unless the beneficiary's interest is exempt by the terms of the trust or by statute. The creditor must exhaust legal remedies before proceeding in equity, but this requirement does not apply if it appears that the attempt to exhaust legal remedies would be futile. Henderson v.

       - This section, insofar as it purports to allow termination of claims after service by publication on known claimants whose whereabouts are known and who are present within the state, violates due process. Suttles v. J.B. Withers Cigar Co., <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 617</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 129</cite> (1942); to the extent that it holds to the contrary, is hereby overruled.

        <p>

        Purpose of this section is to fix a certain date when an estate being administered by an officer of the court, can be closed,
       
       rights fixed, and distribution of the assets made. If claims are to be recognized, either by way of amended claims or as new claims, after the date fixed in accordance with the provisions of this section, the very purpose of the law would be defeated. Cohen v. McCandless, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 231</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 739</cite> (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And, it was the intention of the legislature
       
       to correct the fact that no purchaser knew whether he would purchase property free of liens, and that no receiver could be sure of selling property free of liens. Jones v. Staton, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga. App. 890</cite>, <cite class="app_court">52 S.E.2d 481</cite> (1949).

        All cases, including equity cases, are excluded from this section where there are no assets to administer,
       
       marshal, or otherwise dispose of by the court. Pope v. Pope, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 74</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 43</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In order for the court to issue an order to bar the filing of interventions in equity cases after the date fixed in such order, it is essential that the court have in its control assets to administer, marshal, or otherwise dispose of. Maxwell v. Hollis, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 224</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 360</cite> (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Superior courts can issue bar orders only in cases where the courts have in hand assets that are being administered,
       
       marshaled, or otherwise disposed of by the court. Pope v. Pope, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 74</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E.2d 43</cite> (1954).
       </p>

        <p>

        Generally failure to comply with a "bar order" in receivership proceedings after notice precludes sharing in assets,
       
       similarly, failure to comply with a "bar order" directing claimants to appear and make known their objections to the receiver's final report and recommendations generally precludes later objections. Fibertex, Inc. v. Caldwell, <cite class="ga_court">236 Ga. 136</cite>, <cite class="app_court">223 S.E.2d 111</cite> (1976).

       - While this section refers to "all equity cases" now or hereafter pending, it joins thereto the qualifying provision, "wherein assets of either or both parties to the cause are being administered, marshaled, or otherwise disposed of by the court," thus plainly and conclusively showing that, before this section can be resorted to, the case must be pending in a superior court, and assets must then be in the custody of the court for the purpose of being administered, marshaled, or otherwise disposed of.

       - Neither the fact that all parties and intervenors might be chargeable, as a matter of law with notice that taxes have not been paid, nor that taxes are, under the law, of the highest dignity, obviates the necessity of the filing of an intervention as required by the statute.

       - While it is universally recognized that the United States, as sovereign, is immune from action except as it consents to be sued and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court's jurisdiction to entertain the action, yet where civil litigation involving conflicting claims of ownership of real and personal property and a receivership is pending in a state court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, wherein certain parties by interventions duly allowed seek the foreclosure of mortgages and loan deeds upon real and personal property on which the United States claims a lien under jeopardy assessments issued by the Collector of Internal Revenue for unpaid income taxes, the United States may be made a party to such proceeding under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.

       The provisions of this section regarding exercise of powers of sale are applicable only to instances where a creditor is seeking to sell property
      
      to enforce the payment of a debt or demand secured by such an instrument and does not embrace a will forever disposing of the property of the testator after death, and providing, without more, for the appointment of a successor trustee. Gilmore v. Gilmore, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 770</cite>, <cite class="app_court">41 S.E.2d 229</cite> (1947).

         Duty of mortgagee to exercise fairly and in good faith power of sale.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - There exists a statutory duty upon a mortgagee to exercise fairly and in good faith the power of sale in a deed to secure debt.
   Although arising from a contractual right, breach of this duty is a tort compensable at law. Clark v. West, <cite class="ga_app_court">196 Ga. App. 456</cite>, <cite class="app_court">395 S.E.2d 884</cite> (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The words "sell" and "dispose" are synonymous when coupled together in designating a power in a will
       
       authorizing the sale and disposal of property, when accompanied by a further statement that the sale or disposition may be made at public or private sale, since such words limit the method of disposition of property to a conveyance, and they are equally synonymous when so used in a trust deed. Lindsey v. Robinson, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 648</cite>, <cite class="app_court">180 S.E. 106</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>

        An owner of land sold at public auction under a power of sale in a security deed has a right to come into equity

       Powers of sale in deeds to secure debt are matters of contract, and they must be strictly construed
      
      and will be enforced as written. Verner v. McLarty, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 472</cite>, <cite class="app_court">99 S.E.2d 890</cite> (1957); Holland v. Sterling, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 583</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 894</cite> (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      When by undisputed facts it appears that the sale took place on a date other than as advertised, the court did not err in granting the judgment declaring the order of confirmation null and void, and this is so whether his judgment is considered a judgment on the pleadings, summary judgment, or judgment vacating and setting aside for a nonamendable defect appearing on the face of the record. Hood Oil Co. v. Moss, <cite class="ga_app_court">134 Ga. App. 477</cite>, <cite class="app_court">214 S.E.2d 726</cite> (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      While powers of sale in deeds to secure debt shall be strictly construed and exercised, where the evidence is conflicting in a suit attacking the manner in which a power of sale was being exercised, it is insufficient to show an abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying an interlocutory injunction seeking to restrain the exercise of the power. Jones v. Camp, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 164</cite>, <cite class="app_court">65 S.E.2d 596</cite> (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Powers of sale contained in deeds to secure a debt and instruments of similar nature are strictly construed and must be fairly exercised. In construing such instruments the words employed to express the intention of the parties will be given their ordinary signification, and where the language of the document is plain, its meaning will not be extended by interpretation. Cordele Banking Co. v. Powers, <cite class="ga_court">217 Ga. 616</cite>, <cite class="app_court">124 S.E.2d 275</cite> (1962).

      A power in a security deed authorizing a sale of the property conveyed, by "party of the second part (the grantee), its agents, or legal representatives, or the sheriff of the county in which the land is situate," does not authorize a sale of the property under the power by a transferee of the grantee, under the rule of strict construction applicable to such powers. Stewart v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 848</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 181</cite> (1935).

        <p>
       - Where a security deed, and the power of sale therein contained, were assigned by the original grantee to a new grantee with the same formality of execution as the deed itself, the power of sale therein contained was one which might properly be exercised by second grantee in the foreclosure proceedings. Williams v. Joel, <cite class="ga_app_court">89 Ga. App. 329</cite>, <cite class="app_court">79 S.E.2d 401</cite> (1953).

       <p>
        <p>
       Where power of sale in the security deed executed prior to the act providing that a power of sale may be exercised by the assignee of the instrument was limited to the grantee, the transferee was without power to exercise the power of sale, and consequently, transferee's deed to another in pursuance of the invalid sale did not convey any title.

       - Lower court correctly determined that the debtors lacked standing to challenge the assignment of the security deed to a bank because the security deed afforded the debtors no right to dispute the assignment as the debtors were not third-party beneficiaries of the assignment as a whole and were not intended to directly benefit from the transfer of the power of sale.

        District court properly dismissed the plaintiff's suit against multiple financial institutions and fictitious parties seeking declaratory and equitable relief to stop foreclosure proceedings as there was no dispute that the holder of the security deed at the time of the proposed foreclosure had the authority to foreclose on the property in accordance with the security deed's power of sale.

        - Nominee of a lender had standing to foreclose on the plaintiff's property since a note and the security deed clearly provided that the note could be sold and that the nominee would remain the assignee of any subsequent note holder.

       So far as the six-months prohibition of actions against an administrator is concerned,
      
      there is no difference between the exercise of a power of sale given in a bill of sale to secure a debt, and the foreclosure of such bill of sale by action. Chapman v. Commercial Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">86 Ga. App. 178</cite>, <cite class="app_court">71 S.E.2d 109</cite> (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The execution of the power to sell given in a bill of sale to secure debt is not a suit against an administratrix or the estate of the deceased grantor of the power as would require a delay of six months before action can be taken. Chapman v. Commercial Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">86 Ga. App. 178</cite>, <cite class="app_court">71 S.E.2d 109</cite> (1952).

       A power of sale in a security deed must be fairly exercised;
      
      and where from the language of an advertisement, without more, it appeared that the security deed was void for the want of a legal grantor, the sale might have been chilled by this circumstance and it should have been enjoined until better advertised. Cocke v. Bank of Dawson, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 714</cite>, <cite class="app_court">180 S.E. 711</cite> (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where a security deed stipulates that the land may be sold after "first advertising the same once a week for four successive weeks," the notice may provide a time for the sale other than the day provided for public sale. Bush v. Growers' Fin. Corp., <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 99</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 105</cite> (1932).
      </p>
      <p>

      Where the owner seeking redemption of property sold under a power of sale pleaded an agreement for redemption after sale, made with the trustee in the security deed merely for the purpose of showing that the power of sale was not fairly exercised, and of having the sale annulled, and did not seek specific performance, the petition was not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) because of the agreement's indefiniteness.

      Finding that the lender's conduct constituted an unfair exercise of the power of sale could be based on evidence that the lender: kept information as to the balance due on the debt from the person responsible therefor, knowing that that person would pay the debt; failed to give proper notice of the time and place of the sale; took personal property from the house after the sale; and bought the property for less than one-fifth of the amount he sold it for shortly after the sale.

       If a sale by a trustee in a security deed, under a power of sale, was unauthorized, the deed was not void but was merely voidable,

       A provision in a security deed for accelerating the maturity of the debt should not be so construed as to work hardship on the borrower,
      
      where there has been a bona fide effort on his part to comply with his covenant, and the circumstances are such that his efforts at compliance were apparently acceptable to the lender; in such a case, when there has been no waiver of the covenant by the lender, good faith requires that he should, before undertaking to enforce the provisions of the deed accelerating the maturity of the debt for noncompliance with the terms of the covenant, afford to the borrower a reasonable opportunity to fully meet his obligations thereunder.

       As a general proposition, the power to mortgage would seem to include in it a power to authorize the mortgagee to sell,
      
      on default of payment. Plainville Brick Co. v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 75</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E. 85</cite> (1930).

      A power to a mortgagee to sell property mortgaged on failure of the mortgagor to pay the debt at its maturity is a lawful power and is irrevocable, and this power may be exercised against the mortgagor and those claiming under him either by deed or as purchasers at a judicial sale under process to which the mortgage is superior in its lien. Plainville Brick Co. v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">170 Ga. 75</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E. 85</cite> (1930).

      Even though power of sale in mortgage is conferred upon the grantee for the purpose of facilitating his collection of the amount of the underlying debt which is secured by the property, the power must be exercised fairly; breach of this duty to conduct the sale "fairly" gives rise to a claim for damages to the injured holder of the equity of redemption.

        <p>
       - To obtain equitable relief, plaintiff must allege some element or feature of the contract or in the conduct of the defendant to show that the relief at law would not be adequate; he may show that in case the contract is not specifically performed, his damages will be irreparable, or he may show that the measure of damages resulting from the nonperformance of the contract is uncertain or difficult of ascertainment; he may show that the thing contracted for has some intrinsic or special value, such as is possessed by an heirloom, having a special and peculiar value to its owner over and above any market value that can be placed upon it in accordance with strict legal rules; or he may show that the property, though personal, is not of common class, but is unique of its kind, and cannot be readily reproduced, so that others of a similar nature and equal value cannot be procured by damages assessed by means of legal rules, as is the case with paintings or other works of art. Gabrell v. Byers, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 16</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 227</cite> (1933).

       Where the landlord covenants to maintain the roof in good repair but fails to do so, the remedy of the tenant is to make the repairs himself and look to the landlord for reimbursement, or to occupy the premises without repair and hold the landlord responsible for damages by action or by recoupment to an action for the rent, which remedies are adequate at law. Borochoff Properties, Inc. v. Creative Printing Enters., <cite class="ga_court">233 Ga. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">210 S.E.2d 809</cite> (1974).

       Monetary damages were not an adequate remedy at law for a county in the county's suit against a contractor seeking specific performance of an agreement to donate to the county a completed wastewater treatment facility for which the county had paid. Moreover, the county was not required to use the county's powers of eminent domain as if the contract had never existed. Forsyth County v. Waterscape Servs., LLC, <cite class="ga_app_court">303 Ga.

        As a general rule, equity will not decree specific performance of contracts relating to personal property.
       
       Black v. American Vending Co., <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 420</cite> (1977).

        <p>

        An agreement for equal division of property is one which equity will specifically perform
       
       since land is involved and damages would not be adequate to compensate for nonperformance. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 481</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E.2d 354</cite> (1967).

       - An order of specific performance as to a merely private debt in the form of an unincorporated settlement agreement in a divorce proceeding cannot be deemed to be a more adequate remedy than an action at law for breach of contract damages, since that order cannot constitutionally be enforced by contempt and would not obviate the necessity of the obligee's resort to successive lawsuits for the obligor's future breaches.

        <p>
       - A court will not decree the specific performance of a contract for the sale of land unless there is a definite and specific statement of the terms of the contract. The requirement of certainty extends not only to the subject matter and purpose of the contract, but also to the parties, consideration, and even the time and place of performance, where these are essential. Williams v. Manchester Bldg. Supply Co., <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 99</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 129</cite> (1957); Duvall v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A court will not decree specific performance of a contract which is indefinite and uncertain in any material provision, or where the parties are not specified, or where, in case of lands or interest in lands, the description thereof, or key found therein, is insufficient to identify the same. Bacon v. Bacon, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 191</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 107</cite> (1932); Cashin v.

       A description of land as being parts of two named lots in certain district and section of county, that lie north of lessor's present place of business, bounded on the east by highway, on the north by the county line, on the west by lessor's lands, and on the south by the lands of another individual, is too indefinite to support a decree for possession of the lands by the lessee in an equitable action against the lessor. Harris v. Abney, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 518</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 724</cite> (1951).

       Contract for sale of all of the land known as Wilkinson Pond, consisting of 25 acres, more or less, with the exception of three acres, more or less, to be set aside as a home place containing the Wilkinson home, was void for want of necessary description of any particular land, and afforded no sufficient basis for the extraordinary equitable relief of specific performance. Smith v. Wilkinson, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 489</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 698</cite> (1951).

        <p>
       Specific performance of a contract will not be decreed unless the contract is definite and specific, based upon a sufficient legal consideration, and the proof of it is strong, clear, and satisfactory; if the contract is one entire contract, and one portion of the contract is indefinite, the entire contract fails. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Falligant, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 479</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 473</cite> (1951).

       A petition requesting specific performance of a contract for the sale of land which contains no allegation showing the value of the property involved so as to enable this court to determine whether or not the contract is fair, just, and equitable and can, in good conscience, be decreed to be specifically performed, fails to state a cause of action for specific performance. Crown Corp. v. Galanti, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 660</cite>, <cite class="app_court">140 S.E.2d 898</cite> (1965).

       Because a handwritten loan agreement did not sufficiently describe the land to be conveyed in the event of a default, and because the lender had an adequate remedy at law in the form of a monetary judgment, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant specific performance. Kirkley v. Jones, <cite class="ga_app_court">250 Ga. App. 113</cite>, <cite class="app_court">550 S.E.2d 686</cite> (2001).

        To constitute a valid sale of real estate which a court will require to be specifically performed,
       
       the following are the essentials to the contract of such sale: (1) the memorandum of contract must specify the parties, that is, the seller and the buyer; (2) the memorandum must sufficiently describe the subject matter of the contract; and (3) the memorandum must name the consideration. The consideration need not be expressly stated if the memorandum of contract furnishes a key by which the amount of the purchase price can be ascertained. If the consideration is not all to be paid in cash, then the times and amounts of deferred payments must be specified. When the contract expressly states the amount of purchase money or furnishes a key by which it can be ascertained, then the contract is sufficient. Beller &amp; Gould v. Lisenby, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 15</cite>, <cite class="app_court">268 S.E.2d 611</cite> (1980).

       - While there must be a tender of the purchase price before equity will decree specific performance of a contract for the sale of land, where the petition alleges that the defendants, when notified by the plaintiff that he had purchased from original party his contract with them for the sale of the property, repudiated the contract, notified him that they had no intention of complying with its terms, and that they would refuse to accept the tender of any money under the contract, the tender is waived. Gilleland v. Welch, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 341</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 517</cite> (1945); Todd v.

       <p>

       Before equity will decree specific performance of a contract for the sale of land at the instance of the purchaser, there must, in the absence of waiver, be an unconditional tender of the purchase price. Gilleland v. Welch, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 341</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 517</cite> (1945).

       Where a contract for the purchase of land provided that the purchaser, upon obtaining a deed from the seller, would execute a deed to secure an unpaid balance of the purchase price, and the seller's deed was delivered, but the purchaser refused to execute the security deed, equity would have jurisdiction of a suit by the seller for specific performance, to enforce the terms of the purchaser's agreement.

       Specific performance and damages are not inconsistent remedies, and may be pursued in the same action.

       Specific performance is not a remedy which either party may claim as a matter of absolute right,
      
      and mere inadequacy of price, or any other fact showing the contract to be unfair, unjust, or against good conscience, may justify the refusal of this remedy. Whitehead v.

      Where a contract for the sale of land is in writing, is certain and fair in all its parts, is for an adequate consideration, and capable of being performed, it is just as much a matter of course for a court to decree a specific performance of it as it is for a court to give damages for it in other cases.

       - While payment of a part of the purchase-money is not alone such part performance as will take the case out of the statute of frauds, partial payment of the purchase-money accompanied with possession will amount to such part performance as to take the contract out of the statute and to authorize the specific performance of a parol contract.

       - In a suit for specific performance brought by a plaintiff seeking to enforce an alleged oral contract to sell real property, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant based on the Statute of Frauds preventing recovery to the plaintiff; the plaintiff had presented evidence establishing the existence of an oral contract for the sale of the property and that it was excepted from the Statute of Frauds based on the plaintiff's performance of paying for the property in full, and thus, issues of fact remained as to whether defendant's decedent had accepted performance through payments received by a sibling and whether, in light of the plaintiff's previous tenancy, the plaintiff's performance was inconsistent with the lack of a contract to sell the property. Edwards v. Sewell, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 128</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 246</cite> (2008).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When a party seeking specific performance of an oral contract to sell realty relies on the principle of possession with improvements, it must be shown that the possession and improvement arose by virtue of and in the faith of the oral contract or promise, so as to take the case out of the statute of frauds and constitute the equivalent of a writing by showing acts unequivocally referring to the alleged contract or promise; thus, where a party takes possession under an oral contract to rent, and also alleged an oral option to purchase, the possession is under the tenancy and cannot also be shown to be in reliance on the option. Smith v. Cox, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 563</cite>, <cite class="app_court">277 S.E.2d 512</cite> (1981).

       - In a suit brought by a property owner seeking to specifically perform an oral agreement to purchase a strip of real estate, the trial court properly denied the property owner's request for an interlocutory judgment based on a violation of the statute of frauds and because another held a first right of refusal over the sale/purchase of the property. However, the trial court erred by concluding that the property owner had not obtained a parol license to use the strip since the property owner had made expenditures to improve the land and, as to the right of first refusal held by another, the grant of a parol license was not the equivalent to a sale of the property to have in anyway interfered with that right.

        <p>
       Under an oral agreement, the only performance which plaintiff had yet to complete was his payment of the remaining portion of the agreed purchase price and that payment was not due until closing; therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on plaintiff's claim for specific performance.

Because the dollar amount of the high bid at the foreclosure sale alone made it immediately apparent that there had been a mistake, a reasonable inference arose that had reasonable diligence been employed before the foreclosure sale, the alleged unilateral mistake would not have occurred.

       - Specific performance of a low-cost lease of property was not merited because plaintiff had been paid back for the investment in commencing a landfill on the property and did not argue that an award of money damages was not sufficient. Elliott v. McDaniel, <cite class="ga_app_court">224 Ga.

       Where the defendant simply made a bid for the property at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, which was accepted by the seller, no partial performance of the contract occurred and the transaction, therefore, stayed within the confines of the statute of frauds.

       The trial court did not err in directing a verdict against a counterclaim to enforce an oral agreement between the parties to reconvey property to the defendant, notwithstanding proof of part performance by the defendant consisting of the defendant's continued possession after conveying the property plus making monthly payments to the plaintiff of approximately $450, since, although this was consistent with the existence of an oral agreement to convey the property back to the defendant after a loan was paid off, it was also consistent with the lack of such an agreement, since monthly payments approximating rent did not establish part performance of the alleged oral agreement to reconvey the property to the defendant.

       When a party who leased certain land from its supposed owner, who could not read, attempted to enforce an option to purchase the land, which was included in documents the lessee gave the owner to sign, the lessee's partial payment, possession of, and improvements to the land did not entitle the lessee to enforce the contract under O.C.G.A.

       A trial court erred in finding that a lease-purchase agreement was enforceable because, though it satisfied the statute of frauds, it was invalid for failure of consideration in that the lessee/proposed purchaser never paid the rent owed nor any of the property taxes, which not only invalidated the agreement but voided the purchase option under O.C.G.A.

Further, the trial court erred in holding that the lessee/proposed purchaser was entitled to specific performance of the agreement based on repairs made since there was no legal authority to support the trial court's proposition that part performance of an otherwise unenforceable written agreement, as modified by subsequent oral agreements between the parties, transformed it into an enforceable parol contract.

      Specific performance will not be decreed of a voluntary agreement or merely gratuitous promise. If, however, possession of lands has been given under such an agreement, upon a meritorious consideration, and valuable improvements have been made upon the faith thereof, equity will decree the performance of the agreement.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where possession and valuable improvements are relied upon for specific performance they must have been by virtue of and on the faith of the oral contract or promise so as to take the case out of the statute of frauds and constitute the equivalent of a writing by showing acts unequivocally referring to the alleged contract or promise. The burden rests on the alleged promisee to bring his case within these facts if he does not show other exceptions under
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c02s23-2-131" target="_self">23-2-131</a></cite>; and without such proof he is not entitled to specific performance. Taylor v. Cureton, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 815</cite> (1943).
       </p>

        <p>

        Oral gift of land becomes complete and irrevocable when donee takes possession of donated premises
       
       and, on faith of the gift, makes valuable improvements; and, as against the donor and those claiming under him with notice, a completed gift of land invests the donee with a perfect equitable title. Sharpton v. Givens, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 868</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 806</cite> (1953); Owens v. White, <cite class="ga_court">218 Ga. 1</cite>, <cite class="app_court">126 S.E.2d 425</cite> (1962); Sharp v. Sumner, <cite class="ga_court">272 Ga. 338</cite>, <cite class="app_court">528 S.E.2d 791</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Legal title does not pass merely by parol gift and making of improvements.
       
       A decree of specific performance is necessary to pass the legal title. Doe v. Newton, <cite class="ga_court">171 Ga. 418</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 25</cite> (1930); Beetles v. Steadham, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 110</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 270</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Laches will bar petition for specific performance by one who claims land under voluntary conveyance.
       
       Prater v. Sears, <cite class="ga_court">77 Ga. 28</cite> (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        As a general rule, equity will not decree specific performance of contracts relating to personal property.
       
       Black v. American Vending Co., <cite class="ga_court">239 Ga. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">238 S.E.2d 420</cite> (1977).
       </p>

        Thus gratuitous promise by insured to give his life insurance to his estate cannot be specifically enforced.

        Agreement to settle family controversy will not be considered voluntary

       - Evidence which shows all of the requirements necessary to establish a complete equity to land under a parol gift can be offered as a defense to a dispossessory proceeding. The establishment of a complete equity shifts to the plaintiffs the burden of showing some superior right or title to defeat or overcome the defendant's right. Ogden v. Dodge County, <cite class="ga_court">97 Ga. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E. 321</cite> (1895); Holton v. Mercer, <cite class="ga_app_court">65 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where title is claimed by virtue of provisions of this section, parol gift thus asserted must be established by evidence which shows its existence beyond reasonable doubt.

        <p>

        Petition under this section for specific performance of promise to convey land, to be sufficient as against demurrer (now motion to dismiss), must allege:
       
       (1) the promise to give, (2) a meritorious consideration, (3) possession in his own right by the donee, and (4) the making of valuable improvements. Mankin v. Bryant, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 120</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E.2d 447</cite> (1949); Yates v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In order to prevail under this section, it is necessary to establish each of its requirements
       
       to authorize a decree of performance of the parol gift; furthermore, where title is claimed by virtue of this section, the parol gift thus asserted must be established by evidence which shows its existence beyond a reasonable doubt. Taylor v. Cureton, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 815</cite> (1943); Causey v.

       <p>
        <p>
       Possession of land under a voluntary agreement, based upon a meritorious consideration, with valuable improvements made upon the faith thereof, will invest the holder with such right or equity that he cannot be ousted by the donor, or by a purchaser from him with notice. However, a mere parol gift is not, without more, sufficient to pass title, nor will it vest in the donee any right or equity as against a subsequent purchaser from the donor, with or without notice. Beetles v. Steadham, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 110</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 270</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A parol gift of land in praesenti, based upon a meritorious consideration and accompanied by possession, but with no valuable improvements made upon the land during the lifetime of the alleged donor, will not authorize a decree of title in the donee. Mulligan v. Mulligan, <cite class="ga_court">201 Ga. 444</cite>, <cite class="app_court">39 S.E.2d 699</cite> (1946).

       In action to enjoin trespass on a certain acre of land, where plaintiff's predecessor in title had orally given the land to a church for cemetery uses, pursuant to which gift corner stakes and lines were set up and two graves placed thereon, and there was testimony that plaintiff prior to his purchase of larger tract of which the acre was a part was informed of this gift and saw the graves, a verdict for the defendants was authorized by the evidence.

       - Slight improvements of small value, if they are substantial and permanent in their nature and are beneficial to the land, in other words, if they are such as an owner would ordinarily make upon the land under like circumstances, then these improvements are sufficient to comply with the requirements that plaintiff made valuable improvements. Davis v. Newton, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 58</cite>, <cite class="app_court">108 S.E.2d 809</cite> (1959).

        <p>
       Where petition alleged that plaintiff, relying upon the promise of the corporation to convey to him certain property, went into possession thereof and made valuable improvements thereon, it alleges a benefit to the corporation by reason of the enhancement in value of its remaining property because of the valuable improvements made by the plaintiff, and an injury to the plaintiff, by reason of the valuable improvements made by him in reliance upon the promise.

       Specific performance is not remedy which either party can demand as matter of absolute right,
      
      and will not in any given case be granted unless strictly equitable and just. Bullard v.

       Specific performance of contract may be refused where consideration is inadequate,
      
      though the court will not rescind it under this section. Hunt v. Jackson Formby's Guardian, <cite class="ga_court">43 Ga. 79</cite> (1871).

      <p>
       <p>

       Court should not deny decree for specific performance merely upon ground of inadequacy of consideration,
      
      unless there is such a gross disparity of consideration as to shock the moral conscience and to amount in itself to evidence of fraud, the adequacy of consideration being generally a matter to be determined by the parties for themselves. Whitehead v. Dillard, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 714</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E. 244</cite> (1934); McLoon v.

       - Corporation was properly granted specific performance of a shareholder agreement requiring the corporation's former employees to sell back their shares at the price the corporation offered as the corporation submitted an affidavit calculating the corporation's "going concern" value - the formula for determining share value set out in the shareholder agreement - and the employees offered no evidence countering the affidavit. Furthermore, since there were no allegations that there was anything unfair, unjust, or violative of the conscience about the agreement, the shareholders' equitable defenses were inapplicable to the corporation's claim for specific performance of the agreement.

       - A provision in a contract for deferred payments, without a provision for security to the seller, does not necessarily make a contract inequitable, unjust, and unenforceable under this section. The particular circumstances of the case would determine whether such a contract is fair and just to both parties. Chewning v.

        Contract upon which specific performance is sought must be certain, definite, and clear.
       
       and so precise in its terms that neither party can reasonably misunderstand it. Estes v. Winn, <cite class="ga_court">136 Ga. 344</cite>, <cite class="app_court">71 S.E. 470</cite> (1911); Miller v.

       Where the alleged contract sued on is based on an oral agreement to convey or devise land in consideration of the performance of ordinary personal services, the petition must not only show that the contract is precise in its terms, but must also allege the value of such service and the value of the land or specific data from which such relative values can be determined. Treadwell v. Treadwell, <cite class="ga_court">216 Ga. 156</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1960).

       Petition which did not give with precision the terms of contract for sale of land or its date, and which did not allege the extent and value of the services rendered or the value of the lands involved, which values must be set forth in order to show that the contract which it sought to enforce is one not unfair, unjust, or against good conscience, did not state a cause of action for specific performance. Johns v. Nix, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 417</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 526</cite> (1943); Jenkins v.

       In order for a suit for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land to prevail, the plaintiff must prove the value of the property so as to enable the court to determine that the contract was fair, just, and not against good conscience. Morgan v. Mitchell, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">72 S.E.2d 310</cite> (1952); Jones v.

        <p>
       Where there was a lack of necessary and indispensable allegations as to adequacy of consideration, the petition failed to state a cause of action for specific performance of an option to sell property, the only relief sought; and the court should have sustained the defendants' general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) raising that question and dismissed the petition. Alexander v. American Legion Post No. 28, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">71 S.E.2d 627</cite> (1952).

Harris v. Abney, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 518</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 724</cite> (1951).

     <p>
      The vendor seeking specific performance shall show an ability to comply substantially with his contract in every part and as to all the property. However, a vendor's want of title or other inability as to part of the property shall not be a good answer to the vendee seeking performance who is willing to accept title to part of the property, receiving compensation for the other part. If the defects in the vendor's title are trifling or comparatively small, equity shall decree at his instance, granting compensation for such defects.

      Petition seeking specific performance of a parol contract to convey land was fatally defective because of its failure to show that the petitioner had performed her part of the agreement, namely, to marry the defendant and aid him in regaining his health and carrying on his business, since by virtue of the fact that her Mexican divorce was invalid, the attempted marriage between the parties was void.

       Vendor has his election between specific performance and damages.
      
      Warren v. Camp, <cite class="ga_court">232 Ga. 681</cite>, <cite class="app_court">208 S.E.2d 489</cite> (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Vendor has no right to force upon vendee something which he has not agreed to buy.
      
      The rule is different, however, when the application for specific performance comes from the vendee. There is a manifest reason for this difference. The vendee has a right, if he sees proper to do so, to accept less than he bargained for, and compensation for the loss of that which he does not obtain. R.C. Cropper Co. v. Middle Ga. Broadcasting Co., <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 235</cite>, <cite class="app_court">91 S.E.2d 605</cite> (1956).

       - Where a valid contract has been made to devise certain lands to another, and the person to whom the promise was made has fully performed his part of the contract, but the representative of the person making the promise is unable to perform the entire contract because his decedent did not own all of the property which he agreed to devise, and the other party to the contract is willing to accept that part of the same which the deceased actually owned, a court will require specific performance of the contract as to the part so owned and compensate the injured or disappointed party in damages for the other. Bowles v. White, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 433</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E.2d 547</cite> (1950).

       Where it is impossible for the vendor to convey all of the lands included in the contract of sale, a small portion having been conveyed to the highway department, and it being a contract which in good conscience ought to be performed, equity will decree performance and grant compensation for such land as cannot be conveyed, where the vendee has expressed a willingness to proceed according to the provisions of this section.

       - In an action filed by a trust and its trustee against a school board alleging the breach of a real estate contract, or in the alternative, specific performance of the contract at a reduced purchase price, summary judgment in favor of the school board was reversed on the breach of contract claim; however, summary judgment on the specific performance claim was affirmed, as the trust failed to tender the full purchase price, which was a prerequisite to a specific performance demand, the trust was not excused from doing so, and a tender would not have been futile. Peaches Land Trust v. Lumpkin County Sch. Bd., <cite class="ga_app_court">286 Ga. App. 103</cite>, <cite class="app_court">648 S.E.2d 464</cite> (2007).

        In order to entitle one to recover damages in lieu of specific performance, complainant must prove his right
       
       to the latter remedy. Warren v. Camp, <cite class="ga_court">232 Ga. 681</cite>, <cite class="app_court">208 S.E.2d 489</cite> (1974).

        <p>
       - If, on the trial of an action for specific performance, it should be developed that without fault of the plaintiff but on account of the defendant himself a specific performance of the contract is impossible, the court may proceed to assess damages for a breach of the contract. An amendment praying for such damages would not in contemplation of law make a new cause of action, for this section expressly authorizes the granting of such relief, even when not contemplated by the original suit. Armor v. Stubbs, <cite class="ga_court">150 Ga. 520</cite>, <cite class="app_court">104 S.E. 500</cite> (1920); Lewis v. Warren, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 135</cite>, <cite class="app_court">179 S.E. 918</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In order to entitle one to recover damages in lieu of specific performance, complainant must prove his right
       
       to the latter remedy. Prater v. Sears, <cite class="ga_court">77 Ga. 28</cite> (1886); Loewus v. Eskridge &amp; Downing, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">175 Ga. 456</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 576</cite> (1932).

       <p>

       As a general rule, remedy of decree for specific performance relates only to real estate, and is not applicable to personalty,
      
      so the cardinal rules which apply to the remedy of specific performance are applied with greater strictness where personalty is concerned than where realty is involved. Gabrell v. Byers, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 16</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 227</cite> (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       But there are exceptions to this rule,
      
      and insolvency alone may supply basis for an exception. Reid v. McRae, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 323</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 176</cite> (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where in a settlement between a landlord and a tenant the landlord credited the tenant with a sum for which the tenant agreed that he would turn over to the landlord a check for parity on cotton which he was to receive from the federal government, and where on receipt of the check he failed and refused to endorse and deliver it to the landlord, the tenant being insolvent, the landlord could maintain an action for specific performance to require the tenant to endorse and deliver the check in accordance with the agreement, the petition stating a cause of action for specific performance, injunction, and receivership. Reid v. McRae, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 323</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 176</cite> (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In order to sustain a petition for the specific performance of a contract relating to personal property, it is necessary to allege some good reason in equity and good conscience to take the case out of the general rule. Gabrell v. Byers, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 16</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 227</cite> (1933).

        <p>
       - A petition which sets forth a legal cause of action, though using terms appropriate to an equitable proceeding, insofar as the same does not seek any extraordinary relief, is not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the ground that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy by bringing an action at law. Arteaga v. Arteaga, <cite class="ga_court">169 Ga. 595</cite>, <cite class="app_court">151 S.E. 5</cite> (1929); Woodall v.

        This section changed the rule that a petition praying for only ordinary equitable relief is demurrable
       
       (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the ground that the plaintiff has a complete and adequate remedy at law. Teasley v. Bradley, <cite class="ga_court">110 Ga. 497</cite>, <cite class="app_court">35 S.E. 782</cite>, <cite class="am_st_r">78 Am. St. R. 113</cite> (1900); Booth &amp; Co. v.

        <p>
       - Since the passage of this section a petition which sets forth a legal cause of action, though using terms appropriate to an equitable proceeding, is not demurrable (now subject to motion to dismiss) on the grounds: (a) that it sets forth no cause of action; (b) that there is no equity in the petition; and (c) that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law.

        <p>
       - The joining against the same defendants of legal and equitable rights and remedies which are connected with or dependent upon each other does not render a petition subject to the objection of duplicity or misjoinder of claims. Center v. Arp, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 574</cite>, <cite class="app_court">32 S.E.2d 308</cite> (1944).

        And despite statutory remedies at law, a superior court could settle the whole controversy

Sometimes equitable pleadings by one of the parties may require the making of additional parties, in order that full relief may be granted. Delaney v. Sheehan, <cite class="ga_court">138 Ga. 510</cite>, <cite class="app_court">75 S.E. 632</cite> (1912); Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Taggart, <cite class="ga_app_court">38 Ga.

        So, a plaintiff shall not be harassed by other actions growing out of the same controversy,
       
       although they are based upon independent claims, legal or equitable, which the defendant might have against the plaintiff in reference to the cause of the controversy. McCall v. Fry, <cite class="ga_court">120 Ga. 661</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E. 200</cite> (1904).

Douglas v. Jenkins, <cite class="ga_court">146 Ga. 341</cite>, <cite class="app_court">91 S.E. 49</cite>, 1918C Ann. Cas. 322 (1916); Durden v. Youmans, <cite class="ga_app_court">37 Ga.

       - Where proceeding to enjoin an action against plaintiff to cancel a sale of plaintiff's property by defendant as well as the note on which the defendant is suing arose out of same general plan between the parties to develop and operate a recreational place, defendant in action on note by answer and counterclaim must assert all his claims for legal and equitable relief arising out of the general plan between the parties, and could not bring an independent action to enjoin action on the note and litigate those matters. Clay v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 610</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 602</cite> (1951).

       Where a trover action was filed in a superior court, and thereafter the defendant filed, in a different superior court, an equitable action, to enjoin the trover action, and for other relief, so far as the petition alleged any defense or cause of complaint against any of the parties named as defendants, the same could have been asserted as effectually by way of defense or counterclaim in the trover proceeding, and the allegations did not show any necessity for an independent equitable action.

       - Although under this article a creditor may in one action proceed for judgment on his debt and to set aside a fraudulent conveyance made by his debtor, still, under
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.09.html#t09c05s9-5-6" target="_blank">9-5-6</a></cite>, creditors who have not reduced their demands to judgment, and who have no lien otherwise, cannot, as a general rule, enjoin their debtors from selling or disposing of their property.

        All distinction between legal and equitable remedies and relief and the modes of administering them are not abolished.
       
       Except in providing that both kinds shall be applied for by one form of petition, and may be administered by the court in one and the same proceeding, it leaves the mode of trial as to each unchanged. Mackenzie v. Flannery &amp; Co., <cite class="ga_court">90 Ga. 590</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E. 710</cite> (1892).

        This section does not give to the superior courts an unlimited power
       
       to "give effect to all the rights of the parties, legal or equitable, or both," but the exercise of the power is restricted to instances when the nature of the case may allow or require it. Rogers v. Rogers, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 131</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E. 633</cite> (1936).

       <p>
        <p>
       - While a court of equitable jurisdiction, when it has all the necessary parties before it and has once taken jurisdiction of a particular subject matter, will ordinarily proceed to do complete justice, and finally administer the rights of each of the respective parties, it will not extend its jurisdiction in such manner as to draw to itself collateral matters not appropriately comprehended within the scope of the original proceedings under which, in the first instance, it assumed jurisdiction.

       <p>
        <p>
       - A separate and distinct equitable cause of action against the resident defendant will not give the superior court of the county of his residence jurisdiction of a nonresident defendant against whom the plaintiff has another, independent, separate and distinct equitable cause of action; this is especially true where the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law on his cause of action against the nonresident defendant.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - A petition for an injunction and an accounting, alleging that the defendant had excluded the petitioner from the management of his business and had acquired and failed to account for considerable moneys derived from its profits, while failing to allege any fraud or insolvency of the defendant, and thus not showing any ground for injunctive relief, sufficiently stated a cause of action for an accounting. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 33</cite>, <cite class="app_court">35 S.E.2d 908</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Also, where a plaintiff seeks by way of accounting to recover an amount alleged to be due him upon a contract, and to that extent may have prima facie an adequate remedy at law, and it also appears from the allegations of the petition that his action for damages is not an adequate remedy, or that his legal remedy will be nugatory without the cooperation of equity, the aid of a court of equity may be invoked. Alexis, Inc. v. Werbell, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 665</cite>, <cite class="app_court">75 S.E.2d 168</cite> (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And, while the general rule is that, for a plaintiff to maintain an equitable petition to remove a cloud upon his title,
       
       he must allege and prove possession in himself, nevertheless since it is competent for the plaintiff to obtain both legal and equitable relief in the same action where a plaintiff seeks to have the title to land declared to be in herself, in addition to cancellation and injunction, the fact that the plaintiff fails to show possession in herself does not prevent her from having the title to the property adjudged to be in her, although such fact would defeat the cancellation sought.

       - The owner of land who has to have reformation of one or more deeds in his title chain before he can recover, by ejectment or other legal remedy, the possession of land held adversely to him may bring an action in superior court to reform the deed and in the same action pray for recovery of the possession of the land and for damages for its detention.

       - Where an equitable defense is set up by the defendant in an action of ejectment and prevails against the right of any one or more of the plaintiffs to recover, the common-law rule as to actions of ejectment, that all the plaintiffs shall recover or none, does not apply. Rumph v. Truelove, <cite class="ga_court">66 Ga. 480</cite> (1881); Milner v. Vandivere, <cite class="ga_court">86 Ga. 540</cite>, <cite class="app_court">12 S.E. 879</cite> (1891).

       Where proceeding to enjoin an action against plaintiff to cancel a sale of plaintiff's property by defendant as well as the note on which the defendant is suing arose out of same general plan between the parties to develop and operate a recreational place, defendant in action on note by answer and counterclaim must assert all his claims for legal and equitable relief arising out of the general plan between the parties, and could not bring an independent action to enjoin action on the note and litigate those matters.

       - Dismissal of an action for want of prosecution, where the defendant has filed a cross-claim (now counter-claim) seeking equitable relief, does not dismiss the issues raised by the cross-claim; this is true where the relief sought affects codefendants in the proceeding.

       - Where proceeding to enjoin an action against plaintiff to cancel a sale of plaintiff's property by defendant as well as the note on which the defendant is suing arose out of same general plan between the parties to develop and operate a recreational place, defendant in action on note by answer and counterclaim must assert all his claims for legal and equitable relief arising out of the general plan between the parties, and could not bring an independent action to enjoin action on the note and litigate those matters.

        An ancillary petition may be filed after as well as before a decree
       
       to enable a superior court to effectuate its own decree by ordering one put in possession of property where entitled thereto under its original decree, in order to avoid the further litigation of questions once settled between the same parties. Voyles v. Federal Land Bank, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 569</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 405</cite> (1936).

        After an ancillary petition seeking possession of property is filed, the court may cause other parties to be made,
       
       where they are asserting some rights affecting the property and while a claimant in possession may not be subject to summary dispossession by the sheriff under the warrant sued out, the superior court has authority, under its broad powers, to make the claimant a party in order to settle the rights of all parties in one action, without remitting the petitioner in the ancillary proceeding to a common-law action of ejectment.

       - Where proceeding to enjoin an action against plaintiff to cancel a sale of plaintiff's property by defendant as well as the note on which the defendant is suing arose out of same general plan between the parties to develop and operate a recreational place, defendant in action on note by answer and counterclaim must assert all his claims for legal and equitable relief arising out of the general plan between the parties, and could not bring an independent action to enjoin action on the note and litigate those matters. Clay v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">207 Ga. 610</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 602</cite> (1951).

       Where a trover action was filed in a superior court, and thereafter the defendant filed, in a different superior court, an equitable action, to enjoin the trover action, and for other relief, so far as the petition alleged any defense or cause of complaint against any of the parties named as defendants, the same could have been asserted as effectually by way of defense or counterclaim in the trover proceeding, and the allegations did not show any necessity for an independent equitable action.

        After an ancillary petition seeking possession of property is filed, the court may cause other parties to be made,
       
       where they are asserting some rights affecting the property and while a claimant in possession may not be subject to summary dispossession by the sheriff under the warrant sued out, the superior court has authority, under its broad powers, to make the claimant a party in order to settle the rights of all parties in one action, without remitting the petitioner in the ancillary proceeding to a common-law action of ejectment.

       The question of whether a writ of ne exeat can issue ex parte cannot be raised by a demurrer
      
      (now motion to dismiss) to a petition in an action on the bond. Goldstein v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_app_court">97 Ga. App. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 869</cite> (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       The writ of ne exeat must be issued prior to a final judgment.
      
      The writ is not available to enforce a judgment which has already been obtained. The rule of the common law, whereby the writ of ne exeat issued only after judgment, is not of force in this state, since the common law as to this point has been superseded by this section. Matthews v. Matthews, <cite class="ga_court">177 Ga. 412</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E. 250</cite> (1933).
      </p>

       A ne exeat bond, as provided for by this section, is one for the personal appearance of the defendant at court;
      
      and the conditions of the bond are complied with when the principal is present at court, or within its jurisdiction and subject to its process. August v. August, <cite class="ga_app_court">65 Ga. App. 883</cite>, <cite class="app_court">16 S.E.2d 784</cite> (1941).

       <p>
        <p>
       - The requirements of this section as to what condition or conditions must be given in a ne exeat bond are dependent upon the requirements of the court's order, upon which the writ is issued. Goldstein v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_app_court">97 Ga. App. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 869</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where the court's order only requires an appearance to respond, the principal is required only to give a bond to meet that requirement. The inclusion of more conditions in the bond than required in the order does not render the bond void, and the principal and surety will be bound only by the condition contained in the bond which was required by the court's order. Goldstein v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_app_court">97 Ga. App. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E.2d 869</cite> (1958).

        A statutory bond must follow closely the statute,

        <p>
       Where the application for the issuance of the writ of ne exeat is made in connection with an application for alimony, and no removal of property is involved, but merely an intended leaving of the state by the defendant, the judge ought not to require a bond conditioned both that the defendant will not remove beyond the jurisdictional limits of the state, and also that he will pay any judgment that may be found against him in favor of the plaintiff. This would not only require the husband to give security that he would remain in the jurisdiction, but also that he would be solvent and pay the money judgment. McGee v.

       A plaintiff in an action to quiet title must assert that he holds some current record title or current prescriptive title,
      
      and not only an expectancy, in order to maintain his suit. Gilmore v. Hunt, <cite class="ga_court">137 Ga. 272</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E. 364</cite> (1910); In re Rivermist Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 515</cite>, <cite class="app_court">260 S.E.2d 897</cite> (1979).

       The petition must contain a request for cancellation of an instrument,

      </p>

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because a tax sale listed the wrong owner of the property to be sold and the description of the property was inconsistent, such that it was unclear which property was being sold, the bidder's deed was defective, as was the quitclaim deed of the purchaser of the property from the bidder, and accordingly, there was no merit to the purchaser's claim that it was due summary judgment on the issue of whether the owner's executrix had a right to redeem the property or whether it was barred under O.C.G.A.

         Action not one to quiet title.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Action to set aside a deed that conveyed a property interest did not fit within this section's definition, since the plaintiff was not seeking to cancel an instrument that placed a cloud on her title or subjected her to future liability. Wilson v. United States, 781 F. Supp. 779 (M.D. Ga. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The principle upon which equity will lend its aid to remove a cloud upon title is
       
       that one in the rightful possession of property is entitled to the full, quiet, and peaceful enjoyment of the same, without present annoyance and harassment, or threatened molestation. Duffee v. Jones, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 639</cite>, <cite class="app_court">68 S.E.2d 699</cite> (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Allegations in petition, seeking a cancellation of a deed as a cloud upon the plaintiffs' title to an undivided two-sevenths' interest in the land, were not sufficient to constitute a cause of action as a proceeding quia timet under this section, where the petition did not allege that the deed purported to convey a complete title to a full interest in the tract. Clark v. Woody, <cite class="ga_court">197 Ga. 683</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E.2d 181</cite> (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although it is the general rule that, in order for a plaintiff to maintain an equitable petition to remove a cloud upon his title, he must allege and prove possession in himself, where there is any other distinct head of equity jurisdiction sufficient to support the action, possession of the plaintiff is not required. Sweat v. Arline, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 460</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 893</cite> (1938); Moore v. Moore, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 303</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 18</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where plaintiff seeks specific performance of an oral contract for the devise of property of which he is in possession but which is owned by his aunt, and alleges that distress warrants for rent have been taken against him by her, it is shown that his interest in the property is put in jeopardy by the deed. Harp v. Bacon, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 655</cite> (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A court of equity has jurisdiction to cancel an execution illegally issued,
       
       and this is especially true where there is nothing in the record showing or tending to show that the execution sought to be canceled had been levied on any of the plaintiff's property when the litigation was instituted. Lenett v. Lutz, <cite class="ga_court">215 Ga. 369</cite>, <cite class="app_court">110 S.E.2d 628</cite> (1959).

       - In an action to remove a cloud from title, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to a bank and cancelled a recorded deed in favor of a holder, as: (1) the holder could no longer claim any legal title to the subject property once the underlying debt thereto was paid; (2) no evidence of valid renewal or extension of the note existed; and (3) the holder lacked standing to challenge any foreclosure on the debt.

       - Special master erred in concluding that the property purchaser's action to quiet title was a conventional quia timet employed to quiet title, as that action was used to quiet title as to a deed or other writing which casts a cloud over a title, whereas the property purchaser's action was a quia timet action against all the world; however, no error occurred in denying the property claimant's motion for a jury trial even though an action against the entire world allowed for one, as the evidence did not present a question of fact that required a jury.

        <p>
       - In order for an outstanding conveyance to be a cloud upon title, it is necessary that it of itself, or in connection with alleged extrinsic facts, should constitute an apparent title; that is, one upon which a recovery could or might be had against the true owner were he in possession and relying upon possession alone. Anything which would force him to attack the adverse title, or to exhibit his own, would be a cloud; anything which would not have this effect, would be no cloud. An instrument which springs from no definite source whatsoever, for example, from a stranger to the title, can never properly be considered a cloud. Thompson v. Etowah Iron Co., <cite class="ga_court">91 Ga. 538</cite>, <cite class="app_court">17 S.E. 663</cite> (1893); McMullen v. Cooper, <cite class="ga_court">125 Ga. 435</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E. 97</cite> (1906).

       <p>
        <p>
       - The general rule is that, in order for a plaintiff to maintain an equitable petition to remove a cloud upon his title, he must allege and prove actual possession in himself, for the reason that where the defendant is in possession, the plaintiff has a remedy to test his title at law by bringing an action in ejectment, which is ordinarily deemed an adequate remedy, and there is no ground for the exercise of equitable jurisdiction. Hale v. Turner, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 593</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 10</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Except where there is any other distinct head of equity jurisdiction sufficient to support the action,
       
       possession by the plaintiff is not required, but equity will retain the cause and grant relief by quieting the title or removing clouds. Hale v. Turner, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 593</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 10</cite> (1936); Sweat v. Arline, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 460</cite>, <cite class="app_court">197 S.E. 893</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       A senior unrecorded deed loses its priority over a junior recorded deed for value from the same vendor, taken without knowledge or notice of the existence of the senior deed, and in a proper case may be canceled at the instance of the grantee in such junior recorded deed. Terry v. Ellis, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 698</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 282</cite> (1940).

        Or where land is wild and unoccupied,
       
       or at least not in the actual possession of the defendant, the plaintiff need not be in possession in order to maintain suit to quiet title or remove cloud therefrom. Hale v. Turner, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 593</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 10</cite> (1936).

       - While a special master erred in concluding the property purchaser's action to quiet title was a conventional quia timet action, and, thus, no jury trial was available to the property claimant, the claimant was not harmed by the error; although a jury trial was available regarding the property purchaser's action in quia timet as against all the world, the property claimant did not show that the evidence presented a question of fact, and, thus, the intervention of a jury was not required.

        <p>
       Trial court properly appointed a special master in a quiet title action and a corporation, who was unsuccessful in the corporation's claim for the property, was properly held not entitled to a jury trial because the suing bank had amended the bank's petition to provide for an action only for conventional quia timet by the time it was heard by the special master; therefore, no jury trial was available under O.C.G.A.

       - Findings entered by a Special Master, which determined that the disputed portion of an alley belonged to a landowner, and not the neighbors, by operation of the landowner's prior recorded deed, was not clearly erroneous, as: (1) the landowner received the property via a valid deed; (2) the neighbors failed to put the landowner on notice of their claim; and (3) the neighbors' claim of possession and use was insufficient.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-60" target="_self">23-3-60</a></cite> et seq., the trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiff landowners, finding that they had title to the easement as delineated in the parties' plats, and permanently enjoined defendant adjacent landowners from interfering with use of that easement. Thus, a special master properly concluded that there was not clear and unequivocal evidence of an intention to abandon the easement, which had been acquired by grant, and that the mere nonuse of the easement for a period of time was insufficient to establish its abandonment.

       - Judgment of the trial court that a landowner did not have title to property by virtue of a deed was not error because by its express description, the deed upon which the landowner relied did not convey an interest in the subject property; the deed set forth a metes and bounds description that corresponded to the landowner's house and surrounding lot only, and the description did not include the subject property.

       It was not error for the trial court to adopt the special master's conclusion that title to certain property was vested in a landowner's neighbor because the neighbor's quitclaim deed was the only deed placed before the special master that described an interest in the subject property.

       <p>
        - In cases involving mortgages, Georgia law required that a party first tender the amount due under the note and security deed before seeking the equitable remedy of quiet title; the complaint did not allege that the plaintiff attempted to tender the amount due and defendants refused it, or that the defendants were likely to refuse such an offer. Moreover, the allegations in the complaint did not plausibly support the notion that the plaintiff owned the subject property free and clear, so the plaintiff's quiet title action failed. Warthen v.

       - Special master erred in concluding that the property purchaser's action to quiet title was a conventional quia timet employed to quiet title, as that action was used to quiet title as to a deed or other writing which casts a cloud over a title, whereas the property purchaser's action was a quia timet action against all the world; however, no error occurred in denying the property claimant's motion for a jury trial even though an action against the entire world allowed for one, as the evidence did not present a question of fact that required a jury.

       - In submitting a quiet title case to a special master, a trial court did not cede jurisdiction to render a final decision, and was not obligated to accept a special master's erroneous legal conclusion; a trial court properly rejected a special master's finding that an implied easement was established because access to an owner's home across a neighbors' property was unnecessary, but merely convenient, and because the owner's deed made no mention of a plat allegedly relied on by the owner or a right of way bordering the property, and the plat itself was not recorded.

       - Trial court erred in dismissing the property owner's quiet title claim because, although the bank tried to reform the deed and void the foreclosure that listed 2253 Dawnville as the property foreclosed upon, and the bank's counsel filed an affidavit of title that the bank intended the deed to encumber 2215 Dawnville, the allegations of the property owner's counterclaim disclosed that the property owner would be entitled to relief if it was determined that the property owner did in fact hold unencumbered legal title to 2215 Dawnville, and that the bank through the filing of the affidavits of title and the foreclosure and resulting deed under power, cast a cloud upon that title.

       - In a purchaser's quiet title action against the executor of a testatrix's estate, the trial court did not err in adopting the report of a special master and in decreeing that fee simple title to the land was vested in the purchaser because the purchaser acquired title to the property by virtue of a tax sale and deed, which was conducted in accordance with O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Trial court erred in finding that a neighbor was the rightful owner of certain property because there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the neighbor owned the disputed property either by deed or by adverse possession; the legal description of the property contained in the neighbor's deed did not include the disputed property, and since the evidence showed that, at most, the neighbor made a claim to the disputed property for only eighteen years before being challenged by the landowners, the neighbor's claim to have gained prescriptive title to the property through adverse possession under O.C.G.A.

       Evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that landowners did not own the disputed property because the landowners' occasional maintenance and use of the disputed property did not amount to the type of exclusive possession for twenty years that would support a claim for prescriptive title under O.C.G.A.

       - In a purchaser's quiet title action against the executor of a testatrix's estate, the trial court did not err in adopting the report of a special master and in decreeing that fee simple title to the land was vested in the purchaser because the trial court was authorized to find that the executor's prior quiet title action failed to convey any interest in the property to the executor and to decree that the judgment entered in that action be removed as a cloud upon the purchaser's title when the prior quiet title proceeding was procedurally deficient; the quiet title petition was not verified as required by O.C.G.A.

The county had a direct interest in the proceeding because the owner of the subdivision where the homeowner lived had expressly dedicated all streets delineated in the recorded subdivision plat, including the road in question, to public use; the developer also had a stake in the outcome of the case because of the developer's interest in paving the remainder of the road to provide access to the developer's new development.

         Demand for jury trial must be filed prior to ruling by special master.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In proceedings to remove a cloud on title, a demand for a jury trial cannot be filed after the special master has ruled on the questions of law and fact in the case and submitted his report to the trial court. The judgment entered by the trial court is thus a final judgment to which a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days. Thornton v. Reb Properties, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">237 Ga. 59</cite>, <cite class="app_court">226 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1976); Higdon v. Gates, <cite class="ga_court">238 Ga. 105</cite>, <cite class="app_court">231 S.E.2d 345</cite> (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       This section requires counsel to demand a jury trial for the resolution of any factual issues in the case prior to the time it is heard by the special master. If no demand is filed prior to the time he hears the case, the special master is the arbiter of law and fact and decides all issues in the case unless the master on his own initiative requires a trial by jury of any question of fact. Thornton v. Reb Properties, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">237 Ga. 59</cite>, <cite class="app_court">226 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where a demand for a jury trial was filed before the case was heard by a special master, the trial court did not err in vacating its initial order adopting the special master's report and correctly ordered that a jury trial be held. Addison v. Reece, <cite class="ga_court">263 Ga. 631</cite>, <cite class="app_court">436 S.E.2d 663</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant demanded a jury trial after the start of the hearing in front of a special master, the superior court did not err in approving and adopting the special master's order denying as untimely the defendant's demand. Griffeth v. Griffin, <cite class="ga_app_court">245 Ga. App. 619</cite>, <cite class="app_court">538 S.E.2d 521</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When, in a dispute over the ownership of a parcel of land between a landowner and a railroad, the landowner timely demanded a jury trial before the special master to which the case was referred ruled, it had to be decided whether there was a genuine issue of material fact for a jury to decide, and, because the railroad did not show actual or constructive possession of the disputed land as a matter of law, there was such an issue, and it was error for the trial court to deny the landowner's request for a jury. Watkins v. Hartwell R.R. Co., <cite class="ga_court">278 Ga. 42</cite>, <cite class="app_court">597 S.E.2d 377</cite> (2004).

       In a suit between a church and a minister, the trial court's order striking a portion of the minister's complaint was not a final adjudication of all claims, thereby entitling the minister to appeal. It was only a determination that the minister had waived the right to a jury trial under O.C.G.A.

       In a quiet title action, a party's attorney presented a jury demand at the special master's hearing and in the superior court hearing stating that the action was filed prior to the special master's hearing, and no evidence to the contrary was offered; under O.C.G.A.
   §

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-68" target="_self">23-3-68</a></cite> did not require a hearing before the trial court as to the reasonableness of a special master's fees and costs; moreover, the trial court had discretion to apportion costs between the parties, and the allocation of costs was not controlled by which party prevailed. In part because taxpayers did not prevail on their claims against an assignee of the title to their property, the trial court did not err in assigning them 25 percent of the special master's fees.

       A state depository having state funds on deposit when the state treasurer is suspended and another is appointed to the office pending the suspension may discharge its obligation to the state by accounting for the funds to the appointee, in such case an interpleader will not lie on behalf of the state depository to determine to whom it shall pay the money, whether to the suspended officer or to the appointee, because the law is clear that the appointee is entitled to receive the funds.

        <p>
       - It is essential to the maintenance of a petition for interpleader that there be at least two persons, having conflicting claims, each apparently well founded, to a fund in the hands of a person having no interest in or claim thereon, and who, as between the conflicting claimants, is perfectly indifferent. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">96 Ga. 136</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E. 1002</cite> (1895); Miller Hotel Co. v. Chastaine, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 172</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E. 4</cite> (1936); Mullins v.

       <p>
        <p>
       The general doctrine is, that interpleader lies, where two or more persons claim the same thing, under different titles, or in separate interests, from another person, who, not claiming any title or interest therein himself, and not knowing to which of the claimants he ought of right to render the duty claimed, or to deliver the property claimed, is either molested by an action or actions brought against him, or fears he may suffer injury, from the conflicting claims of the parties against him. Johnson v. Harbison-Walker Mining Co., <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 630</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E. 791</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Conflicting claims must be of such character as to justify a reasonable doubt or reasonable apprehension of danger in order that resort may be had to a court of equity. Reed v.

       Petition for interpleader brought by insurer, alleging that the insured changed the beneficiary named in the policy prior to his death, without alleging when or how the change was made, setting forth a copy of the policy, or stating whether or not the insured reserved to himself the right to change the beneficiary, was insufficient to inform the court of the nature, character, and foundation of the claim so as to enable the court to determine whether or not an interpleader was essential to the plaintiff's protection, and the trial court erred in overruling the general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) to the petition.

       - Trial court properly granted a bank's petition for interpleader with regard to a dispute between church members over funds held by the bank because interpleader was the appropriate method to resolve the dispute over control of the funds since the dispute was secular and not of a religious nature and the resolution of the dispute did not necessitate an impermissible intrusion or excessive entanglement into ecclesiastical matters. The bank was authorized to file the petition based on the terms of the bank's deposit agreement and O.C.G.A.

       - In the case of a petition of strict interpleader, the petitioner must be an indifferent stakeholder, without interest in the subject matter. Phillips v. Kelly, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 111</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 281</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A necessary ingredient of equitable interpleader is that the stakeholder must be disinterested.
       
       Midland Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Emerson, <cite class="ga_app_court">121 Ga. App. 427</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E.2d 211</cite> (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        One who seeks the aid of a court by petition for interpleader must claim no right in opposition
       
       to the claimants to the fund. Holland v. Sterling, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 583</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 894</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where the defendant is not disinterested, as where he denies liability to the plaintiff as well as the other two parties, the action cannot be classified as a pleading for equitable interpleader. Midland Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Emerson, <cite class="ga_app_court">121 Ga. App. 427</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E.2d 211</cite> (1970).

       <p>
        <p>
       The petition in the nature of interpleader cannot be maintained where plaintiffs allege that neither of defendants has any right or title to, or any interest in, the subject matter of the action, nor unless the relief sought is equitable relief. Phillips v. Kelly, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 111</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 281</cite> (1932).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>

       It is essential to an interpleader that the plaintiff be liable to only one of the defendants
      
      and never by any possibility to both. Finance Co. v. Jones Co., <cite class="ga_court">141 Ga. 619</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E. 1033</cite> (1914); Lilley v. Nixon, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 548</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      To entitle a person to a petition of interpleader, he must be in a position in which he is liable to one of two or more persons, who claim from him the same debt or duty; and he claims no right in opposition to the claimants or either of them; and he does not know to whom he ought, of right, to render the debt or duty. Phillips v. Kelly, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 111</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 281</cite> (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where there is a question of double liability and not of double vexation for one liability, the plaintiff is not in that disinterested attitude as to the conflicting claimants which is essential to a petition of interpleader. Lilley v. Nixon, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 548</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      If the question is not to which one of two or more claimants a single duty or debt should be rendered or paid or the same property should be delivered, but whether the person filing the proceeding is liable to each of two holders of different negotiable promissory notes transferred to them respectively before due, on which separate suits have been brought, whether they are not bona fide holders for value and without notice, and whether the debtor has a defense as against each or either of them, arising out of transactions with the original payee, this presents no case of a double claim to one debt or liability but a case of whether there is a double liability, and does not authorize a proceeding for interpleader proper. Gardner v. Haas, Howell &amp; Dodd, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 685</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 863</cite> (1934).

      Petition by the owner of a tract of real estate, seeking to require two brokers with whom the plaintiff had listed the property, to interplead and set up their claims for one commission growing out of a sale of the property, failed to set forth a cause of action for interpleader, since two separate contracts of listing were alleged and there was a possibility under the allegations of the petition that the plaintiff might be liable to both parties. Lilley v. Nixon, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 548</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).

       - It must appear from the allegations of the petition that the conflicting claims of the defendants are of such character as to render it doubtful or dangerous for the plaintiff to act; and in order to do this it is necessary that such claims be set forth so as to inform the court of their nature, character, and foundation, certainly to the extent of enabling the court to determine whether or not an interpleader is essential to the plaintiff 's protection. Mullins v. Autry, <cite class="ga_court">200 Ga. 645</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E.2d 390</cite> (1946); Lilley v.

       When two or more persons claim the same thing, by different and separate interests, and another person, not knowing to which of the claimants he ought of right to render a debt or duty, or to deliver property in his custody, fears he may be hurt by some of them, he may exhibit a petition of interpleader against them. Johnson v. Harbison-Walker Mining Co., <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 630</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E. 791</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        But a stakeholder is not entitled to protection by a court to the extent of being saved from all shadow of risk;
       
       and so where he is in possession of all the facts and there is no question of law which is reasonably debatable, his petition for interpleader should be denied. Citizens Bank v. Middlebrooks, <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">72 S.E.2d 298</cite> (1952); Lowery v. Independent Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">209 Ga. 753</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 5</cite> (1953); Lilley v. Nixon, <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 548</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 716</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In order for a mere stakeholder to invoke the aid of a court of equity by interpleader, it is not necessary that suits actually be filed by all of the claimants, or that there will necessarily be double liability; one of the objects to be accomplished by interpleader is to avoid the danger of a double vexation against a single liability. Johnson v. Harbison-Walker Mining Co., <cite class="ga_court">181 Ga. 630</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E. 791</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If a holder knows all the facts, and the questions of law are not intricate or debatable, a petition for interpleader will not lie; but it is not incumbent upon the holder "to decide at his peril either close questions of fact, or nice questions of law"; and in such a case he may require the parties at interest to set up their claims for determination. Cannon v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 808</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 838</cite> (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Therefore, the doubt or danger that would authorize an interpleader must be reasonable.
       
       Daniel v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 696</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Before one occupying the situation of a stakeholder can call upon adverse claimants of a fund in his hands to interplead, he must satisfactorily show to the court that their claims have such a foundation in law as will create a reasonable doubt as to his safety in undertaking to determine for himself to whom the fund belongs. Smith v. Folsom, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 460</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 824</cite> (1940).

      Where the owner of property has in his possession funds due under a contract for the erection of a house, which are claimed by the materialmen under an asserted equitable assignment from the contractor and by the trustee of the contractor, who has since been adjudicated a bankrupt, the owner may bring the funds into court and maintain a petition for interpleader to compel the conflicting claimants to litigate between themselves their respective rights thereto.

       And on the trial of interpleader each of the claimants occupies the position of plaintiff,

      After a decree has been entered, ordering the petitioner to pay the fund in question into court and ordering the claimants to interplead and set up their claims to the fund, a suit in interpleader becomes, in effect, a proceeding between the claimants alone as adversaries to determine who is entitled to the fund, and the verdict was properly limited to the determination of this issue.

      which appointed him, since an interpleader suit is not an interference with, and cannot mature into a charge on, the assets of bankrupt. Smith v. Folsom, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 460</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 824</cite> (1940).

       - A successor trustee that brought an interpleader action against the original trustee and a broker, involving $60,000 in compensation which the original trustee was entitled to under a court order, was not entitled to summary judgment. The claims of the two interpled parties were not adverse or competing. The original trustee only claimed compensation under the court order as a trustee, not in any other capacity, while the broker only claimed a fee as a broker. Trust Co. Bank v. Citizens &amp; S. Trust Co., <cite class="ga_court">260 Ga. 124</cite>, <cite class="app_court">390 S.E.2d 589</cite> (1990).

       - In an interpleader action, the trial court erred in the court's interpretation of the governing contracts as the funds held by the sheriff for a bail bond corporation were really held on behalf of the owners of the corporation in the owners' individual capacities; thus, a judgment creditor of the individuals was entitled to the funds.

       - Because a husband's counterclaim for reimbursement of the husband's premium payments did not make the insurer an interested stakeholder so as to preclude its interpleader action, the trial court erred in denying the insurer's motion for discharge under O.C.G.A.

       - The principle upon which courts exercising equitable jurisdiction interfere and grant relief is to suppress useless litigation; to prevent multiplicity of suits; to restrain oppressive litigation and to prevent irreparable mischief. Bond v. Little, <cite class="ga_court">10 Ga. 395</cite> (1851); Sutton v. Adams, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 48</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 365</cite> (1934); Consumers Fin. Corp. v.

       - Trial court properly summarily dismissed an attorney's living trust's action against a beach cottage purchaser because a bill of peace and perpetual injunction had been entered and the trust sued the purchaser without obtaining trial court approval, as required by the bill of peace and perpetual injunction. Moreton Rolleston, Jr., Living Trust v. Kennedy, <cite class="ga_court">277 Ga. 541</cite>, <cite class="app_court">591 S.E.2d 834</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">541 U.S. 1042</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S.

        And where the relief can be clearly afforded at law, this section does not apply.
       
       Guess v. Stone Mt. Granite &amp; Ry., <cite class="ga_court">67 Ga. 215</cite> (1881); Mayor of Gainesville v. Dean, <cite class="ga_court">124 Ga. 750</cite>, <cite class="app_court">53 S.E. 183</cite> (1906).

       <p>
        <p>
       While avoidance of a multiplicity of suits may, in a proper case, be considered as an independent ground of equitable jurisdiction, and not a mere auxiliary to other equities present, it does not alone create an equitable cause of action, regardless of other circumstances. Dobbs v. FDIC, <cite class="ga_court">187 Ga. 569</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 672</cite> (1939).
       </p>

       Where the acts of the heir's agent, in charge of operating the decedent's corporation, in mismanaging the corporation, substantially the entire stock of which was owned by the estate, were continuous, still threatened and directly affected the value of the stock, whether the alleged acts are deemed trespasses or waste, it was unnecessary to go further and allege that the defendant was insolvent, since equity is empowered to enjoin such acts, where they would otherwise be likely to give rise to multiplicity of separate suits by the individual heirs against the agent. Shingler v. Shingler, <cite class="ga_court">184 Ga. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 824</cite> (1937).

The Attorney General may delegate authority to a district attorney or other appropriate official of a local government to investigate violations that may have resulted in damages to such local government under Code Section 23-3-121 and may delegate to the local government the authority to bring a civil action on its own behalf, or on behalf of any subdivision of such local government, to recover damages sustained by such local government as a result of such violations, as well as all multiple damages, costs, expenses, attorney's fees, and civil penalties available under Code Section 23-3-121.

Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60 day period upon a further showing in camera that the state or local government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence, and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.

       - This section allowing actions to be joined in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits is primarily for the convenience of parties to the case; and according to a number of authorities, whether it will be allowed is a question largely to be determined by the circumstances in the case. Lyle v. Keehn, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 508</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 655</cite> (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In equitable proceedings a judge of the superior court is empowered to consolidate two or more cases,
       
       in order to avoid useless consumption of the time of the court and needless expense to the taxpayers. O'Malley v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 109</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        This section applies only where there is one common right,
       
       and one is asserting the right against many or many against one; it does not apply where there is only one party plaintiff and one party defendant. Walker Elec. Co. v. Walton, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 246</cite>, <cite class="app_court">46 S.E.2d 184</cite> (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And distinct and separate claims of or against different persons may not be joined in the same action,
       
       but where there is one common right to be established by or against several, equity will determine the matter as to all parties in one action. Lyle v. Keehn, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 508</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 655</cite> (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where there is no semblance of a conspiracy among the different defendants, and no common intent or act, this section affords no support for a multifarious petition. Crutcher v. Crawford Land Co., <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 298</cite>, <cite class="app_court">138 S.E.2d 580</cite> (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It is not necessary or requisite that all of the issues in the cases to be consolidated are identical;
       
       they need only be substantially the same. O'Malley v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 109</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        And neither party offers timely objection, the order of the court constitutes a final consolidation,
       
       and not a temporary consolidation "for the trial." O'Malley v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 109</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       If neither party in the cases to be consolidated offers timely objections to the consolidation, it must be assumed that the litigants consented thereto, and they are bound thereby. O'Malley v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 109</cite> (1936).
       </p>

        This section does not include unnecessary and even improper parties.

      All persons who are directly or consequentially interested in the event of the suit are properly made parties to a petition in equity, so as to prevent a multiplicity of suits by or against parties at once or successively affected by the original case. Hermann v. Mobley, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 380</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E. 38</cite> (1931); Benton v.

       It is not required that in order to be a proper party one must be interested in all the matters
      
      and issues involved in the suit. Hermann v. Mobley, <cite class="ga_court">172 Ga. 380</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E. 38</cite> (1931); Benton v.

      There is no misjoinder of parties or of causes of action, even if the petition concerns things of a different nature against several defendants whose rights are distinct, if it sets forth one connected interest among them all, centering in the point in issue in the case.

      An equitable petition is not multifarious because all of the defendants are not interested in all of the matters contained in the suit; it is sufficient if each party has an interest in some matter in the suit which is common to all, and that they are connected with the others.

      For a party seeking to obtain possession of a disputed tract of land to join a third party assenting a superior claim to possession, it is not necessary that the interest of the parties be identical; the test is the common interest in the subject matter of the litigation, the property of which the plaintiff seeks to be put in possession, and the common interest of each of the defendants is to defeat that effort of the plaintiff and have possession for himself.

      Where petition asserted as to all defendants that the property conveyed to them by the principal defendant was without any legal consideration and purchased with funds stolen from the petitioner, the issue as to that question was common to all of the defendants, and the petition was not subject to the grounds of special demurrer (now motion to dismiss) as to misjoinder of parties and causes of action and multifariousness.

      Where the plaintiffs have a common interest against all of the defendants in a suit as to one or more of the questions raised by it, so as to make them all necessary parties for the purpose of enforcing that common interest, the circumstance of some of the defendants being subject to distinct liabilities in respect to different branches of the subject matter, will not render the bill multifarious.

      Under this rule, a few of the members of an unincorporated association, such as a trade union, may sue in the name or in behalf of all the members, where all by virtue of their membership have a common right or interest in the contract or other subject matter of the suit. The fact that the individual interests of the plaintiffs may in some respects differ, or that all do not have an interest in all the matters embraced in such an equitable suit, will not, as to individual plaintiffs, render the petition multifarious or subject to attack for misjoinder of parties or causes of action, if each of the plaintiffs has an essential interest common to all, with a common connection and right against the defendant. O'Jay Spread Co. v. Hicks, <cite class="ga_court">185 Ga. 507</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E. 564</cite> (1938).

      Petition seeking cancellation of a security deed and injunction against a sale under power contained therein, alleging that the debt which the deed was given to secure had been paid, brought by the administratrix of the estate of the grantor in the deed, a holder of a lien junior to the security deed, the owner of a one-half undivided interest in the lands therein conveyed, of whose interest the defendant grantee had notice at the time the deed was executed, was sufficient to set forth a cause of action for the relief prayed for as against a general demurrer (now subject to motion to dismiss), and was not demurrable (now motion to dismiss) on the ground of multifariousness, or of misjoinder of parties plaintiff, or that the interests of the plaintiffs were antagonistic and divergent as all the plaintiffs had an interest in the realty, and a common interest in seeking to enjoin a sale thereof and cancellation of the deed thereto.

      In view of the interest and general authority of a city to protect its streets and keep them free of obstructions, where separate acts of the railroad company and of the city have the effect to destroy an existing street as a continuous way, the railroad company and the city can be joined in one action for mandamus to compel each to remove the obstructions made by it. Such an action does not show a joinder of separate and distinct claims against different parties. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v.

       The general test, in determining whether cases can be consolidated
      
      or whether an equity suit will lie to enjoin an action at law and try its issues in the equity suit, is whether the two suits could have been joined in one petition; and this depends on whether a misjoinder or multifariousness would result. Sanders v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 765</cite> (1942).
      </p>

      A petition is multifarious when it embraces two or more claims by separate and distinct parties against separate and distinct parties, and where there is no common right to be established. Saliba v. Saliba, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 279</cite>, <cite class="app_court">42 S.E.2d 748</cite> (1947); Burgin Lumber Co. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where a petition should have been dismissed in the lower court for improper joinder and for multifariousness, the appellate court will not rule upon the merits of the several claims set forth in the petition, because it would be possible for a plaintiff to include in one action a multitude of disconnected claims against as many separate persons, and thus procure a decision upon the merits of each, and in effect avoid the rule against joining in one action separate claims against separate persons. Burgin Lumber Co. v. Kirksey, <cite class="ga_court">203 Ga. 439</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E.2d 68</cite> (1948).

      Even though under this section equity might reach out and bring in as parties persons not already joined, it will not do so if a misjoinder or multifariousness would result. Such would be the result if separate claims with different issues would have to be determined. Sanders v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 765</cite> (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Where there are two actions at law, brought by separate plaintiffs, to recover damages ex delicto, in which neither party has a joint interest with the other, and a person who is a defendant in both actions at law seeks to convert one of them into an equitable suit on the sole ground of avoiding multiplicity, the rules against multifariousness are more strictly applied to deny the joinder. Sanders v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E.2d 765</cite> (1942).
      </p>

       The issuance of an order of consolidation is a matter within the sound legal discretion of the judge,
      
      and the exercise of this discretion will not be disturbed, unless manifestly abused. O'Malley v. Wilson, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 97</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E. 109</cite> (1936).

         Effect of suit in superior court.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When a plaintiff sues a defendant in the superior court, the policy of the law requires the controversy growing out of the cause of action alleged by the plaintiff to be settled in that suit. Hamilton v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 820</cite>, <cite class="app_court">180 S.E. 840</cite> (1935); Brewer v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 341</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        An ancillary petition may be filed after as well as before a decree to enable a court of equity to effectuate its own decree
       
       by ordering one put in possession of property where entitled thereto under its original decree, in order to avoid the further litigation of questions once settled between the same parties. Voyles v. Federal Land Bank, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 569</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 405</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       After an ancillary petition seeking possession of property is filed, the court may, on application in a proper case, cause other parties to be made, where they are asserting some rights affecting the property and while a claimant in possession may not be subject to summary dispossession by the sheriff under the warrant sued out, the court of equity has authority, under its broad powers, to make the claimant a party in order to settle the rights of all parties in one action, without remitting the petitioner in the ancillary proceeding to a common-law action of ejectment. Voyles v. Federal Land Bank, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 569</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 405</cite> (1936).

        Claims arising ex contractu cannot be set off against claims arising ex delicto,
       
       except upon equitable grounds. Brewer v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 341</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since plaintiffs' petition seeking to enjoin the defendant from the commission of an alleged tort in cutting and removing timber was not an action in tort or ex delicto, but an equitable proceeding, defendant was not only entitled but bound to set up all defenses that he had to the suit, either legal or equitable, and to pray for all relief needed in aid thereof, ordinary or extraordinary. Brewer v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 341</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 190</cite> (1954).

       - Where the beneficiary of a trust has been adjudged incompetent, and is not capable of giving his valid consent to the conveyance of property which has been placed in trust for him prior to his becoming incompetent, and which may be conveyed by the trustee with his consent, a court of equity, in the exercise of its broad, comprehensive, and plenary jurisdiction of trusts and the estates of wards of chancery, may make the election for such incompetent, and authorize the trustee to convey the property.

       - Where a surviving spouse had abandoned his minor children and could not be found, the factual circumstances demand the exercise of the court's equitable powers to preserve the rights of the minor children.

       A decree is the judgment or sentence of a proceeding instituted in a court of equity.

         Decree should conform to the law.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When there is an error of law apparent on the face of the auditor's report, wholly irrespective of the evidence on which it is based, the judge in framing his decree should correct any error of law apparent on the face of the report, and make his decree conform to the law. Owen v. S.P. Richards Paper Co., <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 258</cite>, <cite class="app_court">3 S.E.2d 660</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        A decree must follow the verdict upon which it is founded;
       
       but this principle does not require that no decree be rendered unless the verdict contains all the facts upon which it is founded. A decree should follow the finding of facts found by a special verdict; but, while the judge in rendering the decree cannot go contrary to the facts found in a special verdict, he may examine the pleadings, admissions made by the parties, and all undisputed facts. In the absence of anything to the contrary, it will be presumed that the judge was authorized by the pleadings, admissions made by the parties, or by the undisputed evidence, to enter the decree which he rendered. Gray v. Junction City Mfg. Co., <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 33</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 847</cite> (1942); Allen v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 269</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 483</cite> (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In proceedings for equitable relief, it is the duty of the judge to submit such issues as will enable him to make a decree from the verdict, the pleadings and the undisputed facts. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 269</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 483</cite> (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Only such questions need be put to the jury as will enable them fully to find the facts in issue and not admitted by the pleadings. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">198 Ga. 269</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 483</cite> (1944).
       </p>
       <p>

        The construction of an ambiguous decree made by the judge who granted it is conclusive.

       A decree may be partly final and partly interlocutory;

      A final decree disposing of all the substantial equities of the case is not made interlocutory by the mere reservation of the right to direct the mode of its execution. Johnson v. James, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 680</cite>, <cite class="app_court">272 S.E.2d 692</cite> (1980).

        <p>
       - After a jury returns a general verdict finding a nuisance exists, the trial court is authorized under this section to mold its decree so as to meet the exigencies of the case and the prayers of the plaintiffs. Tufts v. DuBignon, <cite class="ga_court">61 Ga. 322</cite> (1878); Parnell v.

       Trial court was entitled to enter an order molding the verdict in continuing a nuisance case pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t23c04s23-4-31" target="_self">23-4-31</a></cite>, as doing so was necessary to meet the exigencies of the case and the prayers of the landowners, and the order entered three months after judgment did not modify the judgment in any matter of substance not contemplated by the parties at the time the judgment was entered.

       - In molding a decree upon the jury's verdict upon the facts, the chancellor (now judge) has a very broad discretion in determining what steps shall be taken to secure the enforcement of the rights awarded by the verdict, to the end that equity may afford adequate and complete relief, and this discretion will not in any case be controlled unless it is manifest there has been an abuse of discretion in a material matter.

       - Where, in a divorce case, the jury clearly intended to create a trust for the purpose of providing support for the minor child during his minority and they also intended that there be monthly payments from the trust for the use of the child, but the husband failed to take any substantive steps to set up the trust, there was no error in the trial court naming a trustee and providing the necessary provisions to effectuate the trust for the purpose of providing monthly child support, such as requiring the husband to make the payments necessary to keep current on his obligations for his share of the debts, encumbrances and maintenance of the trust property.

         Effect of decree affecting out-of-state property generally.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Petition charging that defendant husband was seeking to place his property where it could not be reached by his wife (his judgment creditor) presented a situation where upon proof a court of equity could grant prayers for setting aside alleged fraudulent conveyance and transfer to out-of-state resident, as well as alleged fraudulent claims of lien for attorneys' fees, and for appointment of a receiver to take charge of defendant's assets and under the direction of the court sell enough to pay the petitioner the amount now due under her two judgments. Peoples Loan Co. v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 537</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 811</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Petition brought against a judgment debtor and other defendants, alleging that they entered into a conspiracy in bad faith to hinder, delay, or defraud the petitioner in the collection of her two judgments, and that in pursuance of such conspiracy various properties of the judgment debtor were secreted and fraudulent conveyances were made, with the result that the property of the judgment debtor in this state not so concealed or conveyed was insufficient to discharge the amount due under the two judgments, and seeking to set aside such fraudulent conveyances and the appointment of a receiver and other relief, stated a cause of action against the four defendants. Peoples Loan Co. v. Allen, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 537</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 811</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a case is a proper one in other respects for equitable relief independent of statute, an obligation can be enforced wherever defendant is personally within the jurisdiction of the court, although land lying in another state may be affected by the decree and in such cases the court does not act upon the land, or make any order in reference to it; it simply declares a certain transaction relating to the land fraudulent, as between the complainant and the offending parties, and thus removes it as an obstruction to the creditor's legal remedy. Dodd v. Bell, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 313</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 663</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When a court of equity has jurisdiction of the person of a defendant, it may decree the specific performance of a contract for the conveyance of land situated in a foreign state or country, and also restrain a defendant by injunction in certain specified cases, by acting upon the person of the defendant within its jurisdiction. Dodd v. Bell, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 313</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 663</cite> (1935).

       - Where the court enjoins the defendant from disposing of property except by the approval of court, at an interlocutory hearing to secure the appointment of a receiver and to impress a trust on said property, it is error under this section for the court by a subsequent interlocutory judgment to order the defendant to deliver the property to plaintiff before an adjudication of the issue of the ownership of the property.

       - Where action is filed in a superior court, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of a provision of a municipal charter on the ground that such provision is unconstitutional, and where it appears that no arrest has been made, no property levied upon, and no other interference with the person or the property rights of the petitioner, but that the petition is based upon a mere apprehension that such may be done by the municipality, it is proper to refuse an interlocutory injunction.

        Trial by jury in an equity case is generally a matter of right
       
       under the law of this state. It is true the right does not exist under the Constitution as common-law cases, but it is as clearly provided by statutes applicable generally to cases in equity.

       - In view of the repeal of Code 1933,

        It was error for the court to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended petition at an interlocutory hearing for temporary injunction,
       
       on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to authorize the grant of such preliminary relief. Because the allegations of the petition, as amended, if true, made a case entitling them to injunction, and whether an interlocutory injunction should or should not have been granted by the trial judge under the facts presented, the plaintiffs still had a right to have a hearing before a jury with a view of determining whether or not a permanent injunction should be granted. Jones v. Mauldin, <cite class="ga_court">208 Ga. 14</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E.2d 452</cite> (1951).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Where a proper citation for contempt is brought by the plaintiff in the original equity suit, it may be considered as a branch of the equity case and tried accordingly. Alred v. Celanese Corp. of Am., <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 371</cite>, <cite class="app_court">54 S.E.2d 240</cite> (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        The respondent in a citation for contempt is entitled to be apprised of the acts which he is charged with committing
       
       in violation of the injunctive order, so that he may be prepared to defend against such allegations on the hearing. Hortman v. Georgia Bd. of Dental Exmrs., <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 560</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 732</cite> (1958).
       </p>
       <p>

       The respondent in a citation for contempt is entitled to be apprised of the acts which he is charged with committing
      
      in violation of the injunctive order, so that he may be prepared to defend against such allegations on the hearing. Hortman v. Georgia Bd. of Dental Exmrs., <cite class="ga_court">214 Ga. 560</cite>, <cite class="app_court">105 S.E.2d 732</cite> (1958).
