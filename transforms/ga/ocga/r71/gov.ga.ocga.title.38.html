      Section 1. Purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to protect the public through verification of competency and ensure accountability for patient care related activities all states license emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs), advanced EMTs, and paramedics. This Compact is intended to facilitate the day-to-day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS personnel licensed in a member state. This Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of EMS personnel and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. This Compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t38c03s38-3-71ol11">
       Increase public access to EMS personnel;
      </li>
      <li id="t38c03s38-3-71ol12">
       Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially patient safety;
      </li>
      <li id="t38c03s38-3-71ol13">
       Encourage the cooperation of member states in the areas of EMS personnel licensure and regulation;
      </li>
      <li id="t38c03s38-3-71ol14">
       Support licensing of military members who are separating from an active duty tour and their spouses;
      </li>
      <li id="t38c03s38-3-71ol15">
       Facilitate the exchange of information between member states regarding EMS personnel licensure, adverse action, and significant investigatory information;
      </li>
      <li id="t38c03s38-3-71ol16">
       Promote compliance with the laws governing EMS personnel practice in each member state; and
      </li>
      <li id="t38c03s38-3-71ol17">
       Invest all member states with the authority to hold EMS personnel accountable through the mutual recognition of member state licenses.

For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:

          Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
         </p>

Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.

      The Emergency Management Assistance Compact is enacted into law and entered into by the State of Georgia with all other states which adopt the compact in a form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <div>
      <h5>
       "EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       The contracting states solemnly agree that:
      </h5>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE I - PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term "states" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.
      </h5>
      <p>
       The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE II - GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
      </h5>
      <p>
       The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE III - PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       a)It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:
      </h5>
      <ol>
       <li id="t38c03s38-3-81ol11">
        Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
       </li>
       <li id="t38c03s38-3-81ol12">
        Review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.
       </li>
       <li id="t38c03s38-3-81ol13">
        Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.
       </li>
       <li id="t38c03s38-3-81ol14">
        Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.
       </li>
       <li id="t38c03s38-3-81ol15">
        Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material.
       </li>
       <li id="t38c03s38-3-81ol16">
        Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.
       </li>
       <li id="t38c03s38-3-81ol17">
        Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.
        <p>
         Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state(s), whichever is longer.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within 30 days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:
      </p>
      <p>
       A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as but not limited to fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.
      </p>
      <p>
       There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.
      </p>
     </div>

      <h5>
       ARTICLE IV - LIMITATIONS
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.
      </h5>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE V - LICENSES AND PERMITS
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.

     </div>
     <div>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE VI - LIABILITY
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.
      </h5>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE VII - SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.

      </h5>
      <h5>
       ARTICLE IX - REIMBURSEMENT
       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>

Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this provision.
      </h5>

       <span class="headbreak">
       </span>
       Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines, and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.

      </h5>
      <p>
       Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

      It is the finding of the General Assembly that natural disasters and disasters created by human agency often arise suddenly and that cooperation among government agencies and volunteer service agencies is vital in coping with such emergencies. The General Assembly further finds that dedicated service by trained and experienced volunteers can help prevent loss and destruction of life and property and that it is in the interest of the state and the citizens of the state to allow certain state employees who are trained and experienced in disaster relief to provide such service for brief periods without loss of pay and benefits.

      The General Assembly recognizes the extreme dangers present when the safety of our citizens requires first responders such as police and firefighters to evacuate or secure a building. To better prepare for responding to disasters, criminal acts, and acts of terrorism, the General Assembly intends to create a state-wide first responder building mapping information system that will provide first responders with information they need to be successful when disaster strikes. The first responder building mapping information system shall be developed for this limited and specific purpose and does not impose standards or system requirements on any other mapping systems used for any other purpose.
