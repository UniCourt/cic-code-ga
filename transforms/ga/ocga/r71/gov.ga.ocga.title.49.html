       The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide for programs for home delivered meals, transportation services for the elderly, and preschool children with special needs, including but not limited to disabled children, troubled children, school readiness programs, and other similar needs for the benefit of the citizens of Georgia. In addition to and as a supplement to traditional financing mechanisms for such programs, it is the policy of this state to enable and encourage citizens voluntarily to support such programs.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c01s49-1-7ol1b">
       To support programs for home delivered meals, transportation services for the elderly, and preschool children with special needs which programs have been established or approved by the department or the Department of Community Health, the department may, without limitation, promote and solicit voluntary contributions through the income tax return contribution mechanism established in subsection (f) of this Code section, through offers to match contributions by any person with moneys appropriated or contributed to the department or the Department of Community Health for such programs, or through any fund raising or other promotional techniques deemed appropriate by the department or the Department of Community Health.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c01s49-1-7ol1c">
       There is established a special fund to be known as the "Home Delivered Meals, Transportation Services for the Elderly, and Preschool Children with Special Needs Fund." This fund shall consist of all moneys contributed under subsection (b) of this Code section, all moneys transferred to the department under subsection (f) of this Code section, and any other moneys contributed to this fund or to the home delivered meals, transportation services for the elderly, or preschool children with special needs programs of the department or the Department of Community Health and all interest thereon. All balances in the fund shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account identifying the fund and shall be carried forward each year so that no part thereof may be deposited in the general treasury. The fund shall be administered and the moneys held in the fund shall be expended by the department through the Division of Aging Services in furtherance of home delivered meals and transportation services to the elderly programs and by the Department of Community Health in furtherance of preschool children with special needs programs.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c01s49-1-7ol1d">
       Following the transmittal of contributions to the department for deposit in the fund pursuant to subsection (f) of this Code section, the expenditure of moneys in the fund shall be allocated as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t49c01s49-1-7ol1d1">
         Fifty percent of the contributions to the fund shall be used for home delivered meals and transportation services to the elderly programs; and

      <li id="t49c01s49-1-7ol1e">
       Contributions to the fund shall be deemed supplemental to and shall in no way supplant funding that would otherwise be appropriated for these purposes. Contributions shall only be used for benefits and services and shall not be used for personnel or administrative positions. The department and the Department of Community Health shall each prepare, by February 1 of each year, an accounting of the funds received and expended from the fund and a review and evaluation of all expended moneys of the fund. The reports shall be made available to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to the members of the Board of Human Services, and, upon request, to members of the public.

         Unless an earlier date is deemed feasible and established by the Governor, each Georgia income tax return form for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1993, shall contain appropriate language, to be determined by the state revenue commissioner, offering the taxpayer the opportunity to contribute to the Home Delivered Meals, Transportation Services for the Elderly, and Preschool Children with Special Needs Fund established in subsection (c) of this Code section by either donating all or any part of any tax refund due, by authorizing a reduction in the refund check otherwise payable, or by contributing any amount over and above any amount of tax owed by adding that amount to the taxpayer's payment. The instructions accompanying the income tax return form shall contain a description of the purposes for which this fund was established and the intended use of moneys received from the contributions. Each taxpayer required to file a state income tax return who desires to contribute to such fund may designate such contribution as provided in this Code section on the appropriate income tax return form.
        </li>
        <li id="t49c01s49-1-7ol1f2">
         The Department of Revenue shall determine annually the total amount so contributed, shall withhold therefrom a reasonable amount for administering this voluntary contribution program, and shall transmit the balance to the department for deposit in the fund established in subsection (c) of this Code section; provided, however, that the amount retained for administrative costs, including implementation costs, shall not exceed $50,000.00 per year. If, in any tax year, the administrative costs of the Department of Revenue for collecting contributions pursuant to this Code section exceed the sum of such contributions, the administrative costs which the Department of Revenue is authorized to withhold from such contributions shall not exceed the sum of such contributions.

       The department may receive from any law enforcement agency conviction data that is relevant to a person whom the department, its contractors, or a district or county health agency is considering as a final selectee for employment in a position the duties of which involve direct care, treatment, custodial responsibilities, or any combination thereof for its clients. The department may also receive conviction data which is relevant to a person whom the department, its contractors, or a district or county health agency is considering as a final selectee for employment in a position if, in the judgment of the employer, a final employment decision regarding the selectee can only be made by a review of conviction data in relation to the particular duties of the position and the security and safety of clients, the general public, or other employees. Further, the department or any licensed child-placing agency, designated by the department to assist it in preparing studies of homes in which children in its custody may be placed, may receive from any law enforcement agency conviction data that is relevant to any adult person who resides in a home where children in the custody of the department may be placed.

       The department shall establish a uniform method of obtaining conviction data under subsection (a) of this Code section which shall be applicable to the department and its contractors. Such uniform method shall require the submission to the Georgia Crime Information Center of fingerprints and the records search fee in accordance with Code Section 35-3-35. Upon receipt thereof, the Georgia Crime Information Center shall promptly transmit fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a search of bureau records and an appropriate report and shall promptly conduct a search of its own records and records to which it has access. After receiving the fingerprints and fee, the Georgia Crime Information Center shall notify the department in writing of any derogatory finding, including, but not limited to, any conviction data regarding the fingerprint records check or if there is no such finding.

Immediately following the employment decisions or upon receipt of the conviction data concerning any adult person who has contact with a child who is the subject of a child protective services referral, complaint, or investigation or who resides in a home where children in the custody of the department may be placed, all such conviction data collected by the department or the licensed child-placing agency shall be maintained by the department or child-placing agency pursuant to laws regarding and the rules or regulations of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Georgia Crime Information Center, as is applicable.

The department shall establish a uniform method of obtaining criminal history information under this subsection. Such method shall require the submission to the Georgia Crime Information Center of fingerprints together with any required records search fee in accordance with Code Section 35-3-35. Upon receipt thereof, the Georgia Crime Information Center shall promptly transmit the fingerprints submitted by the department to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a search of bureau records and an appropriate report and shall promptly conduct a search of its own records and records to which it has access. Such method shall also permit the submission of the names alone of such adult persons to the proper law enforcement agency when the department is considering placement of a child in exigent circumstances for a name based check of such adult person's criminal history information as maintained by the Georgia Crime Information Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In such exigent circumstances, the department shall submit fingerprints of those adult persons in the placement home, together with any required records search fee, to the Federal Bureau of Investigation within 15 calendar days of the date of the name based check on that person. The fingerprints shall be forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation through the Georgia Crime Information Center in accordance with Code Section 35-3-35. Following the submission of such fingerprints, the department may receive the criminal history information, including arrest and conviction data, relevant to such person. In the event that a child has been placed in exigent circumstances, a name based records search has been requested for any adult person of the placement household, and that adult refuses to provide fingerprints after being requested to do so by the department, the child shall be immediately removed from the placement household by the department, provided that the child is in the custody of the department.

   for appointment by the constituted fiscal or financial agents of a county as a member of the county board of public welfare (now county board of family and children services), yet, notwithstanding such ineligibility, if the justice is appointed as a member of the board and acts as such, the justice, while so acting, is a member of the board de facto, and the official acts of the board wherein the justice participates are valid, and cannot be collaterally attacked upon the ground that such person was incompetent to hold such office.

Each portion of this Act for which such waiver is required shall become effective only if the waiver is obtained, and in that event shall become effective upon the ninetieth day following the receipt of such waiver. The remainder of this Act shall become effective July 1, 1996."

       Pursuant to Ga. L. 1996, p. 1517,
   §
   3, waivers were applied for regarding those provisions of subsection (f) relating to public assistance. However, passage of the federal "Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996" eliminated the need for such waivers, effective July 1, 1997.
   The provisions of subsection (f) enacted by Ga. L. 1996, p. 1517,
   §
   1.2 regarding medical assistance and food stamps did not become effective because the requisite federal waivers were not obtained.

     <p>
      The department may examine any books, papers, or memoranda reflecting the income of, or financial records bearing upon the determination of the eligibility of, recipients in instances of alleged fraud by recipients of food stamps and public assistance. This process may be implemented by means of a subpoena which may be issued by the commissioner of human services, upon the advice of the State Department of Law. In order to consider the issuance of such subpoenas, the director of the department's office of fraud and abuse must personally make application in writing to the commissioner of human services specifying why such information is necessary. If issued, such subpoenas shall compel the production of relevant documents. Subpoenas shall be served in the same manner as if issued by a superior court. If any person fails to obey a subpoena issued and served under this Code section with respect to any matter germane to the department's investigation, on application of the department, through the commissioner of human services or the commissioner's duly authorized representative, the superior court of the county in which the documents were required to be produced may issue an order requiring the person to comply with the subpoena and to produce the relevant documents.

       <p>
        - Restrictions on reimbursement for abortions contained in Georgia's rules amount to a denial or reduction of a required service to an otherwise eligible recipient solely because of that eligible recipient's condition, i.e., pregnancy, and furthermore, these restrictions are not based on medical necessity or utilization control procedures nor is any contention made by the defendants that the abortions sought by the plaintiffs were not medically necessary or presented utilization control problems; therefore, under 42 C.F.R.

     <p>
      Abuse is defined as a provider knowingly obtaining or attempting to obtain medical assistance or other benefits or payments under this article to which the provider knows he or she is not entitled when the assistance, benefits, or payments are greater than an amount which would be paid in accordance with those provisions of the department's policies and procedures manual which are adopted pursuant to public notice, and the assistance, benefits, or payments directly or indirectly result in unnecessary costs to the medical assistance program. Isolated instances of unintentional errors in billing, coding, and costs reports shall not constitute abuse. Miscoding shall not constitute abuse if there is a good faith basis that the codes used were appropriate under the department's policies and procedures manual and there was no deceptive intent on the part of the provider.

       The General Assembly finds that the department frequently must pay more for prescription drugs furnished to recipients of medical assistance under this article than certain health care providers pay for the same products. In order to control more effectively the costs of such drugs, the department may establish a Medicaid Prescription Drug Bidding and Rebate Program as provided in this Code section.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-4-152.1ol1b">
       The department may request sealed bids from prescription drug manufacturers for both brand name and generic equivalent prescription drugs specified by the department. The bids shall be proposed agreements by these manufacturers to adjust prices of drugs specified by the department to a price designated as the bid price when those drugs are supplied to recipients of medical assistance under this article. If the department has accepted a bid for a drug under this Code section, the department may not reimburse a provider of such drug for any equivalent drug not so successfully bid during the term of the contract awarded with regard to the drug so bid. The department may elect not to reimburse for any multisource drugs of a drug manufacturer which does not participate in the bid process or which bids prices considered excessive by the department.

       All prescription drugs for which bids are submitted must meet applicable standards of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, the State Board of Pharmacy, and be guaranteed as meeting all requirements, regulations, and comparison data under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations thereunder. The manufacturer of a drug which is bid must have an FDA approved New Drug Application or an abbreviated New Drug Application and must have a product liability insurance policy extending to pharmacy providers under this article, but the policy may condition coverage thereunder upon the provider's complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder.

       Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to change the practice of pharmacies having provider agreements under this article with respect to their purchases and sales of and reimbursements for drugs furnished to recipients of medical assistance under this article.

      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-4-152.1ol1e">
       In the event no acceptable bids are received for a drug for which a request for bid was made, the department may select a single drug supplier for the drug or establish one price for such drug which the department will reimburse therefor, but this shall not restrict the department from establishing one price for any drug upon which the department does not request bids.

       - Decision of the department of community health (DCH) interpreting the phrase "last approved cost report" as used in the DCH's policies and procedures manual for purposes of computing an owner's reimbursement rate was not entitled to judicial deference because the phrase was not used in a statute, rule, or regulation, but rather in the manual, the terms of which had not undergone the scrutiny afforded a statute during the legislative process or the adoption process.

        Exhaustion of administrative remedies.
       
       Commissioner of the Department of Community Health, members of the board of that Department, and the Director of the Department's Division of Medical Assistance could not avoid judicial review for want of exhaustion of administrative remedies when the very rules of the department precluded both hearing and a remedy sought by a Medicaid-eligible woman; moreover, no adequate administrative remedy existed which the woman could have exhausted.

        - Rules promulgated by Georgia's Department of Medical Assistance (now Department of Community Health) restricting reimbursement to Medicaid enrollees for medically necessary abortions are inconsistent with Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.
   §
   1396 et seq., and because the plaintiff classes will suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate legal remedy, the defendants, the defendants' agents and employees, must be permanently enjoined from refusing to provide Medicaid reimbursement to the members of the plaintiff classes for the provision of all medically necessary abortions.

   §
   2/HB 551, not codified by the General Assembly, provides:
   "The General Assembly recognizes that the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the Georgia Medicaid program can and does cause the state treasury to incur serious financial losses which results in direct harm to the taxpayers of this state.
   This Act is intended to provide a partial remedy for this problem by providing specific procedures whereby this state, and private citizens acting for and on behalf of this state, may bring civil actions against persons and entities who have obtained state funds through the submission of false or fraudulent claims to state agencies. This Act, in its provision for double and sometimes treble damages, is remedial in purpose, and is intended not to punish, but insofar as possible to make the state treasury whole for both the direct and indirect losses caused by the submission of false or fraudulent claims resulting in payments by this state or state agencies.
   By receiving a portion of the recovery in civil actions brought under this article, 'whistle blowers' are encouraged to come forward when they have information about the submission of false claims to the Georgia Medicaid program, and rewarded when their initiative results in civil recoveries for this state."

Such a showing shall be conducted in camera.

Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to a civil action under this Code section. For purposes of this subsection, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the State of Georgia, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.

Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds.

If the person bringing the civil action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of Code Section 49-4-168.1, such person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the civil action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the State of Georgia to continue the civil action, represented by the Attorney General.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that changes in the approval process of certain health care programs have made it difficult for children with disabilities who are eligible for medical assistance pursuant to Article 7 of this chapter to receive the services to which they are entitled with the frequency and within the time periods which are appropriate. Separate administration of the categorically needy and the medically fragile programs should not result in any variation in the amount, duration, and scope of services. Redundant paperwork requirements have hampered service approvals and delivery and reduced the number of providers serving children. It is the intent of this article to ensure that children with disabilities receive the medically necessary therapy services to which they are entitled under the Medicaid Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Program and that categorically needy and medically fragile children have available to them the same scope, duration, and amount of services. It is also the intent of this article to simplify the process and paperwork by which occupational, speech, and physical therapy services are applied for and received by eligible recipients.

      The schedule of assistance to be paid to a recipient family under this article shall eliminate the increment in benefits under the Georgia TANF Program as a result of the birth of a child during the period in which the family is eligible for TANF assistance or during a temporary period in which the family or recipient is ineligible for TANF assistance pursuant to a sanction imposed for failure to comply with eligibility requirements, subsequent to which the family or recipient is again eligible for assistance. The recipient family in which the recipient parent gives birth to an additional child during the recipient's period of eligibility for TANF assistance, or during a temporary period of ineligibility for assistance, may not receive additional assistance, except in the case of a general increase in the amount of TANF assistance which is provided to all program recipients. This provision shall only apply to recipient families who have been in receipt of cash assistance under this article for a total of ten months after May 1, 1997. Nothing in this Code section shall be considered to disqualify a recipient family from an incremental increase in assistance in cases in which the birth of a child is the result of a verifiable rape or incest.

       ARTICLE I.
       <span class="headbreak">

       PURPOSE.
      </h5>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;
      </p>
      <p>
       Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;
      </p>
      <p>
       Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;
      </p>
      <p>
       Insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;
      </p>
      <p>
       Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;
      </p>
      <p>
       Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

       Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the by-laws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or the Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the by-laws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission by-laws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.

       - Ga. L. 2018, p. 201,
   §
   2/HB 670, provides that the 2018 amendment becomes effective if a legislative branch representative is appointed and serving on the Georgia State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision on June 30, 2018, then the amendment shall become effective upon the termination of his or her term of service.
   Furthermore, if a legislative branch representative has not been appointed and is not serving on such council on June 30, 2018, then the amendment shall become effective on July 1, 2018.
   This Code section, as set out above, does not reflect the amendment by that Act owing to the delayed effective date.
   As of May 2018, this contingency had not been met.
   After the contingency is met, paragraph (1) will read as follows:
   "(1)
   The Governor shall by executive order establish the initial composition, terms, and compensation of the Georgia State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision required by Article IX of that compact, with the Governor making the appointments to those positions; provided, however, that there shall be two representatives from the legislative branch of government and one representative from the judicial branch of government who shall be appointed as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(A)
   The Speaker of the House of Representatives shall make one appointment of a legislative branch representative;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(B)
   The President of the Senate shall make one appointment of a legislative branch representative; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(C)
   The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall make one appointment of a judicial branch representative;".
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The 2018 amendment,
       </b>
       rewrote paragraph (1). For effective date, see the delayed effective date note.

       - Visitation rights of a parent of a child in the custody of the Department of Family and Children Services are a residual "parental tie" which is not severed by the mere placement of the child in the temporary custody of the department without a specific finding as to that right. In re K.B., <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 199</cite>, <cite class="app_court">372 S.E.2d 476</cite> (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Once temporary legal custody of a child was placed in the department under a shelter care order, the sole right to determine where and with whom the child would live vested with the department; the direction of the trial court to remove the child from the father's home was not binding, and the trial court's later contempt finding based on this order was improper.

       Ga. L. 1993, p. 1969,
   §
   1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The General Assembly estimates that up to $6 million will be saved on an annual basis when the provisions of Code Sections 49-4-112, 49-4-113, and 49-4-115 are fully implemented for complete fiscal years. It is the intent of the General Assembly that such cost savings realized by the implementation of these three Code sections be redirected into the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program in the following priorities:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) Extension of transitional Medicaid for up to 24 months provided a federal waiver is obtained;

   5-1/HB 242, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that: "This Act shall become effective on January 1, 2014, and shall apply to all offenses which occur and juvenile proceedings commenced on and after such date. Any offense occurring before January 1, 2014, shall be governed by the statute in effect at the time of such offense and shall be considered a prior adjudication for the purpose of imposing a disposition that provides for a different penalty for subsequent adjudications, of whatever class, pursuant to this Act. The enactment of this Act shall not affect any prosecutions for acts occurring before January 1, 2014, and shall not act as an abatement of any such prosecutions."

      <p>
       Ga. L. 2015, p. 675,
   §
   1-2/SB 8, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a)
   The General Assembly finds that arresting, prosecuting, and incarcerating victimized children serves to retraumatize children and increases their feelings of low self-esteem, making the process of recovery more difficult.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that both federal and state laws recognize that sexually exploited children are the victims of crime and should be treated as victims.
   The General Assembly finds that sexually exploited children deserve the protection of child welfare services, including family support, crisis intervention, counseling, and emergency housing services.
   The General Assembly finds that it is necessary and appropriate to adopt uniform and reasonable assessments and regulations to help address the deleterious secondary effects, including but not limited to, prostitution and sexual exploitation of children, associated with adult entertainment establishments that allow the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol on premises and that provide to their patrons performances and interaction involving various forms of nudity.
   The General Assembly finds that a correlation exists between adult live entertainment establishments and the sexual exploitation of children.
   The General Assembly finds that adult live entertainment establishments present a point of access for children to come into contact with individuals seeking to sexually exploit children.
   The General Assembly further finds that individuals seeking to exploit children utilize adult live entertainment establishments as a means of locating children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
   The General Assembly acknowledges that many local governments in this state and in other states found deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments are exacerbated by the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol in such establishments.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b)
   The purpose of this Act is to protect a child from further victimization after he or she is discovered to be a sexually exploited child by ensuring that a child protective response is in place in this state.
   The purpose and intended effect of this Act in imposing assessments and regulations on adult entertainment establishments is not to impose a restriction on the content or reasonable access to any materials or performances protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, Section I, Paragraph V of the Constitution of this state."

   6-1(b)/SB 8, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that this article "shall become effective on January 1, 2017, provided that a constitutional amendment is passed by the General Assembly and is ratified by the voters in the November, 2016, General Election amending the Constitution of Georgia to authorize the General Assembly to provide specific funding to the Safe Harbor for Sexually Exploited Children Fund.
   If such an amendment to the Constitution of Georgia is not so ratified, then Part 3 of this Act shall not become effective and shall stand repealed by operation of law on January 1, 2017." The constitutional amendment was approved by the voters in November, 2016.

Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that such agency is making progress toward meeting prescribed rules and regulations of the department, the department may, in its discretion, reissue such temporary license or commission for one additional period not to exceed one year.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court erred by failing to provide the defendant with the county child abuse documents the defendant requested during the defendant's trial for child molestation, but the defendant was not denied due process since the defendant failed to show that the trial court withheld any material, exculpatory information.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t49c05s49-5-40ol1b" target="_self">49-5-40(b)</a></cite>, reports made to the Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS) are confidential, the law of defamation requires only that the statement be disseminated to any person other than the person slandered.

       - Trial court did not err by failing to release documents showing earlier child abuse from a child's file which might have been critical to a defendant's case since the burden was on the defendant to show what documents in a child's sealed file were suppressed and how it was materially exculpatory and the defendant failed to make the showing.

         Procedure for obtaining records for child abuse investigation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When the defendant assigned error to the trial court's failure to direct the Department of Human Resources to disclose any and all reports used by or prepared by the department in investigating an allegation of child abuse, since the records sought by defendant were confidential and access thereto was prohibited except as provided by O.C.G.A. Art. 2, Ch. 5, T. 49, the proper procedure for obtaining access was to petition the trial court to subpoena the records and conduct an in camera inspection as to whether the records were necessary for determination of an issue before the court and were otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence. Defendant's general Brady motion was inadequate to have properly raised this issue in the court below, and the assertion of error in this regard was meritless. Davidson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga. App. 557</cite>, <cite class="app_court">359 S.E.2d 372</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga.

       - In a prosecution for aggravated child molestation and related crimes, the trial court did not err in denying the defense request for the notes and work product of the social workers who testified at trial concerning the social workers' contact with the children involved. Moss v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">216 Ga. App. 711</cite>, <cite class="app_court">455 S.E.2d 411</cite> (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a prosecution for child molestation, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's request for a complete copy of files from the Department of Family and Children Services. Honeycutt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">245 Ga. App. 819</cite>, <cite class="app_court">538 S.E.2d 870</cite> (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Given the fact that the defendant failed to request an in camera inspection of confidential records and files pertaining to allegations of sexual abuse allegedly committed by the defendant until appellate counsel did so in the second amended motion for new trial, the state was not obligated to produce the information and did not violate the defendant's due process rights under Brady or Georgia's reciprocal discovery act by not providing the file earlier. Moreover, some of the information was known to the defendant, and no showing that the information could have been obtained with due diligence was made. Ellis v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 452</cite>, <cite class="app_court">657 S.E.2d 562</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a child molestation conviction, after the defendant determined during trial that the state had not informed the defendant of an additional interview conducted by the victim's counselor, the state did not violate the Georgia Reciprocal Discovery Act, O.C.G.A.

       - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant access to the incest victim's MySpace.com and school records because the defendant failed to show both the materiality and the favorable nature of the evidence sought. Stephens v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">305 Ga. App. 339</cite>, <cite class="app_court">699 S.E.2d 558</cite> (2010).

        <p>
       Trial court did not err in failing to forward to the defendant the court's confidential file documents regarding two child molestation victims because the trial court's finding that the files contained no exculpatory evidence was alone sufficient, and the defendant made no showing that the material was exculpatory; a defendant who challenges a trial court's in camera inspection on appeal must show what information was suppressed and how that information was materially exculpatory.

       - Trial court erred by failing to provide the defendant with the county child abuse documents the defendant requested during the defendant's trial for child molestation, but the defendant was not denied due process since the defendant failed to show that the trial court withheld any material, exculpatory information.

       - Trial court did not err by failing to release documents showing earlier child abuse from a child's file which might have been critical to a defendant's case since the burden was on the defendant to show what documents in a child's sealed file were suppressed and how those documents were materially exculpatory and the defendant failed to make the showing.

      As an alternative to the requirements set out in this article pertaining to obtaining preliminary criminal records check determinations through the department for employees, foster parents, and adults residing in a foster care home, but not including directors of centers, centers may obtain GCIC information through local law enforcement agencies. The center shall be responsible for reviewing the GCIC information obtained for the potential employee, or foster parent or other adult residing in the foster care home, and making a written determination that the individual does not have a criminal record as defined in this article. This written determination, together with all supporting documentation received from any law enforcement agency, must be maintained in the center's file and available for inspection by the department. This satisfactory determination must be made before the employee or foster parent begins any duties for the center. However, where there is an urgent need for an emergency temporary employee to work at a center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing requirements, such center may utilize the applicant as an emergency temporary employee after applying for the preliminary records check through the local law enforcement agency and completing the affidavit. In such emergency situations, the director of the center must complete an affidavit, with all supporting documentation attached thereto, stating that the GCIC information has been requested through an identified local law enforcement agency and that the results were not immediately available to the center prior to assigning the employee to work with children at the center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing ratios. The affidavit with supporting documentation must be maintained in the center's file on the individual and available to the department for inspection. The director shall review the GCIC information upon receipt, but in no case shall an emergency temporary employee be permitted to continue working for more than three days without having a satisfactory determination made by the director and entered into the center's file on the employee with all supporting documentation. The department shall promulgate rules and regulations limiting the extent to which centers are authorized to use emergency temporary employees in accordance with this Code section. Foster parents and adults residing in a foster care home utilized by child-placing agencies shall never be utilized as emergency temporary employees of the child-placing agency. Employees, emergency temporary employees, foster parents, and other adults required to have records checks who are utilized by centers are subject to all other requirements set forth in this article. Where the department has reason to question the validity of the GCIC information or the satisfactory determination made by the center, the department may require the employee, emergency temporary employee, foster parent, or other adult to submit a preliminary criminal records check application through the department together with appropriate fees.

      A determination by the department regarding preliminary or fingerprint records checks under this article, or any action by the department revoking, suspending, or refusing to grant or renew a license based upon such determination, shall constitute a contested case for purposes of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," except that any hearing required to be held pursuant thereto may be held reasonably expeditiously after such determination or action by the department. It is expressly provided that upon motion from any party, the hearing officer may, in his discretion, consider matters in mitigation of any conviction, provided the hearing officer examines the circumstances of the case and makes an independent finding that no physical harm was done to a victim and also examines the character and employment history since the conviction and determines that there is no propensity for cruel behavior or behavior involving moral turpitude on the part of the person making a motion for an exception to sanctions normally imposed. If the hearing officer deems a hearing to be appropriate, he will also notify at least 30 days prior to such hearing the office of the prosecuting attorney who initiated the prosecution of the case in question in order to allow the prosecutor to object to a possible determination that the conviction would not be a bar for the grant or continuation of a license or employment as contemplated within this title. If objections are made, the hearing officer will take such objections into consideration in considering the case.

       Its intent to reduce the number of children committed by the courts to institutions operated by the Department of Juvenile Justice and the Department of Human Services or other state agencies and to provide a preventive, comprehensive plan for the development of community based alternatives so that children who have committed delinquent acts and children who are at risk of becoming dependents of state government and its institutions may not have to be committed to a state detention facility or other such facility. Additionally, it is the intent of this part to provide for noninstitutional disposition options in any case before the juvenile court where such disposition is deemed to be in the best interest of the child and of the community.

The General Assembly further finds that the work of some of these agencies overlaps, and that the at-risk families and troubled children of Georgia will be more efficiently and effectively served by consolidating the Children and Youth Coordinating Council with the Children's Trust Fund Commission, by placing the functions of the Georgia Child Fatality Review Panel under the supervision of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children, and by encouraging these consolidated agencies to collaborate to create a consistent vision for serving the needs of our state's families in need."

       In recognition of the fact that services to these children are provided by several different agencies, each having a different philosophy, a different mandate, and a different source of funding, the General Assembly intends that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities shall have the primary responsibility for planning, developing, and implementing the coordinated system of care for severely emotionally disturbed children. Further, it recognizes that to enable severely emotionally disturbed children to develop appropriate behaviors and demonstrate academic and vocational skills, it is necessary that the Department of Education provide appropriate education in accordance with P.L. 94-142 and that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities provide mental health treatment.

The General Assembly further finds that the work of some of these agencies overlaps, and that the at-risk families and troubled children of Georgia will be more efficiently and effectively served by consolidating the Children and Youth Coordinating Council with the Children's Trust Fund Commission, by placing the functions of the Georgia Child Fatality Review Panel under the supervision of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children, and by encouraging these consolidated agencies to collaborate to create a consistent vision for serving the needs of our state's families in need."

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that a large proportion of school-aged children in Georgia do not currently have access to adequate medical treatment and, further, that this lack of access can hinder a child's ability to reach his or her full physical and educational potential. The General Assembly further finds that federal funding made available to the states under Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act may be used to administer programs to provide such coverage. The General Assembly further finds the provision of adequate medical coverage for this population to be in the public interest and further declares the establishment of the program pursuant to this article to be a desirable and economical means of increasing access to such medical coverage.

      <p>
       The purpose of this article is to assist functionally impaired elderly persons in living dignified and reasonably independent lives in their own homes or in the homes of relatives or caregivers through the development, expansion, reorganization, and coordination of various community based services. In recognition of the desire of older Georgians to reside at home or with their families as long as possible, the General Assembly intends that a continuum of care be established so that functionally impaired elderly persons age 60 and older may be assured the least restrictive environment suitable to their needs. The General Assembly further intends to maximize the utilization of existing community social and health services in order to prevent unnecessary placement of individuals in long-term care facilities. The development of innovative approaches to program management, staff training, and service delivery that impact on cost avoidance, cost effectiveness, and program efficiency shall be encouraged. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of Community Health shall serve as the agency responsible for planning and implementing the provision of community based services to the elderly reimbursable under the "Georgia Medical Assistance Act of 1977."

       - Ga. L. 2007, p. 133,
   §
   1/HB 24, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "(a) The General Assembly has long recognized the right of the individual to control all aspects of his or her personal care and medical treatment, including the right to insist upon medical treatment, decline medical treatment, or direct that medical treatment be withdrawn.
   In order to secure these rights, the General Assembly has adopted and amended statutes recognizing the living will and health care agency and provided statutory forms for both documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The General Assembly has determined that the statutory forms for the living will and durable power of attorney for health care are confusing and inconsistent and that the statutes providing for the living will and health care agency contain conflicting concepts, inconsistent and out-of-date terminology, and confusing and inconsistent requirements for execution. In addition, there is a commendable trend among the states to combine the concepts of the living will and health care agency into a single legal document.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The General Assembly recognizes that a significant number of individuals representing the academic, medical, legislative, and legal communities, state officials, ethics scholars, and advocacy groups worked together to develop the advance directive for health care contained in this Act, and the collective intent was to create a form that uses understandable and everyday language in order to encourage more citizens of this state to execute advance directives for health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) The General Assembly finds that the clear expression of an individual's decisions regarding health care, whether made by the individual or an agent appointed by the individual, is of critical importance not only to citizens but also to the health care and legal communities, third parties, and families. In furtherance of these purposes, the General Assembly enacts a new Chapter 32 of Title 31, setting forth general principles governing the expression of decisions regarding health care and the appointment of a health care agent, as well as a form of advance directive for health care."

      The General Assembly having declared that Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is a looming state and national public health crisis and having found that it is in the best interest of the state and its citizenry to address this issue created a Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan for the purpose of developing a strategy to mobilize a state response. The provisions of this chapter are enacted to further the intention of the State of Georgia to become a more dementia-friendly and dementia-capable environment for the citizens of Georgia with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. To further that purpose, the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan Advisory Council is created to ensure that focus remains on implementing and amending as needed the goals set forth in the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan.

In order to perfect such lien, the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency shall file in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county wherein the individual resides a verified statement setting forth the name and address of such individual; the name and address of the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency; the amount claimed to be due for such vocational rehabilitation services; and, to the best of claimant's knowledge, the names and addresses of all persons, firms, or corporations claimed by such injured individual, or the legal representative of such individual, to be liable for damages arising from such injuries. The Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency shall also, within one day after the filing of such claim or lien, mail a copy thereof to any person, firm, or corporation so claimed to be liable for such damages to the addresses as given in such statement. The filing of such claim or lien shall be notice thereof to all persons, firms, or corporations liable for such damages, whether or not they are named in such claim or lien. The clerk of the court shall endorse thereon the date and hour of filing in the hospital lien book, along with the name of the claimant, the injured person, the amount claimed, and the names and addresses of those claimed to be liable for damages. Such information shall be recorded in the name of the injured individual. The clerk shall be paid $1.00 as his or her fee for such filing. No release for such cause or causes of action or any judgment thereon, or any covenant not to sue thereon, shall be valid or effectual as against such lien unless the holder thereof shall join therein or execute a release of such lien; and the claimant of such lien may enforce the lien by an action against the person, firm, or corporation liable for such damages.
