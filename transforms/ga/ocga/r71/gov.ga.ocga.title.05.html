     - In light of the similarity of the statutory provisions, decisions under former Code Section 5-3-1, which was subsequently repealed but was succeeded by provisions in this article, are included in the annotations for this article.
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Right to appeal to superior court is fixed by statute,
    
    and lies only from bodies or tribunals when appeal therefrom is provided by statute. Georgia Power Co. v. Friar, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 675</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 210</cite> (1933), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 470</cite>, <cite class="app_court">175 S.E. 807</cite> (1934).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     When amount claimed is over $50.00,
    
    the law confers right to appeal to superior court. Humphrey v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_app_court">13 Ga. App. 557</cite>, <cite class="app_court">79 S.E. 530</cite> (1913).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     When amount in controversy is $50.00 or less,
    
    appeal will not lie as matter of right. Gay v. Brown, <cite class="ga_app_court">45 Ga. App. 862</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E. 374</cite> (1932).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Party may appeal to jury in superior court.
    
    Hendrix &amp; McBurney v. Mason, <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 523</cite> (1883); Southern Express Co. v. Hilton, <cite class="ga_court">94 Ga. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E. 126</cite> (1894); Wood v. McCrary, <cite class="ga_court">107 Ga. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">33 S.E. 395</cite> (1899).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Parties may appeal by consent from justice court to superior court
    
    when amount involved is sufficient to authorize appeal. Smith v. Rawson, <cite class="ga_court">61 Ga. 208</cite> (1878).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     General statutory meaning of appeal from inferior court to superior court
    
    is that, after having been tried in inferior court, jurisdiction of entire case is transferred to superior court for another complete trial. Hartley v. Holwell, <cite class="ga_court">202 Ga. 724</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 896</cite> (1947).

     <p>
    - In case of appeal from ordinary's court (now probate court) to superior court, the various sections relating to appeals to superior court from justice's courts, county courts, and courts of ordinary are in pari materia, and should be construed as providing for a single system of appellate procedure. Wofford v. Vandiver, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1945).

    <p>
     <p>
    - Right given to party to appeal from judgment in justice's court is predicated on assumption that by judgment complained of appellant has failed entirely in suit or has failed to recover full amount sued for, as to hold otherwise would be to run counter to the well-settled principle that no one will be heard to complain of a judgment unless one has been injured or is aggrieved thereby. Walker v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 361</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 695</cite> (1943).
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>

     Party not aggrieved by judgment of trial court
    
    is without legal right to except thereto, since the party has of it no just cause of complaint. Walker v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 361</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 695</cite> (1943).

      Distinction between statutory appeal and appeal by writ of error.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p>
    - Statutory appeal providing for another trial in appellate court on merits of case is altogether different from writ of error on appeal for correction of errors in trial eventuating in judgment from which appeal is taken. In latter proceeding inquiry is into correctness of judgment upon pleading and evidence before trial court. The appellate court affirms or reverses in whole or in part the judgment on review and certifies result to trial court, when the final judgment is entered. That procedure has nothing in common with that of a statutory appeal. The statutory appeal allows litigants in certain cases the right to another trial in superior court upon compliance with certain requisites. The trial in superior court is had without reference to evidence introduced in former trial, and is a de novo investigation. City of Macon v. Ries, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 320</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E. 21</cite> (1934).

    - In trying appeal from county court, superior court can reach no result which could not have been reached in county court had case been finally disposed of there; hence on trial of such appeal the superior court cannot entertain an equitable petition offered by the defendant as an amendment to a plea of general issue, which petition contemplates and prays for relief which only a court of equity, or a court of law exercising full equity powers, could administer, such as rescission of contracts, cancellation of promissory notes or injunction.

    In trying appeal from county court, superior court can deal with no question of merits except as could have been raised in county court, and can render no final judgment except such as county court had jurisdiction to render. Greer v. Burnam, <cite class="ga_court">69 Ga. 734</cite> (1882); Hufbauer v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">91 Ga. 298</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E. 159</cite> (1893).

    - When case is on appeal in superior court from justice's court, any amendment of summons whether in matter of form or of substance, may be made, which could have been made while case was pending in primary court; the only restriction on either court is that there must be enough to amend by. Wofford v. Vandiver, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1945).

    - In justice's court, which is not a court of record, many defenses are allowed to be made by oral plea, and on appeal to superior court these defenses are required to be reduced to writing before case proceeds to trial. Wofford v. Vandiver, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1945).

     <p>
    - In appeal from county court to superior court, trial of the case is a de novo proceeding, but it by no means follows that pleadings and defenses in the case are to begin over again in the new trial; on the contrary, the new trial is had on papers connected with the case when judgment was rendered, subject to proper amendment. Wofford v. Vandiver, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 623</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1945).

       - When appraisers filed their return for year's support, objections thereto were filed and matter was appealed by consent to superior court, and judgment of court of ordinary (now judge of probate court) was thereby expressly waived; such express waiver had same legal effect as formal decision or judgment of court of ordinary (now probate court) as to matter at issue, and status of widow as to vesting of her title was same as if decision or judgment had been formally rendered. Tilley v. King, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 602</cite>, <cite class="app_court">19 S.E.2d 281</cite> (1942), later appeal, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga.

       - Pretermitting when the final order occurred, the superior court correctly held that the probate court had no authority to extend the time to appeal beyond the statutorily-prescribed period of 30 days. Accordingly, the probate court's order extending the period beyond that provided for in the statute was of no legal consequence, and the superior court did not err in granting summary judgment.

       - Appeal from probate court to superior court is for the purpose of conducting a de novo investigation in the superior court, and not for the purpose of correcting errors of law committed in the probate court. Thus, there can be no direct appeal to the superior court from an interlocutory ruling in the probate court. Driver v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">198 Ga.

       - Notwithstanding a settlement agreement in which the decedent's wife released any interest in the decedent's estate, given that the decedent's mother was not a party in the probate court, despite publication of notice and service by the wife, the mother lacked standing to appeal the probate court's decision to award the wife a year's support.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Statutory appeal providing for another trial in appellate court on merits of the case is altogether different from writ of error on appeal for correction of errors in trial eventuating in judgment from which appeal is taken. In latter proceeding the inquiry is into correctness of judgment upon pleading and evidence before the trial court. Appellate court affirms or reverses in whole or in part the judgment on review and certifies result to trial court, where final judgment is entered. That procedure has nothing in common with that of a statutory appeal. The statutory appeal allows litigants in certain cases the right to another trial in superior court upon compliance with certain requisites. Trial in superior court is had without reference to evidence introduced in former trial, and is a de novo investigation. City of Macon v. Ries, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 320</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E. 21</cite> (1934).

        Appeal of an application for a year's support award
       
       by a probate court is a de novo proceeding in the superior court, and as such, the appeal is subject to the established procedures for civil actions, thus entitling a party to invoke summary judgment.

        <p>
       - In appeal from inferior court, or assessors in condemnation proceeding, to superior court, the law contemplates that if judgment is obtained in superior court the prevailing party is entitled to superior court execution and aid of all processes of superior court to enforce the court's judgment. A dismissal of the entire case or proceedings with consent of court might be permissible under some circumstances, for this would be a final termination of the entire case or proceedings, but appellant cannot, at will and without consent of the adverse party, certify the case back to the inferior court, or to assessors, and relegate adverse party to processes of inferior court. Such would be the effect of allowing appellant to withdraw the appeal without consent of the adverse party contrary to provisions of former Code 1933,

       <p>
        <p>
       - Difference must be noted between dismissing case on appeal and dismissing an appeal. The first dismissal lets out whole case while second is an affirmance of judgment below and rights of all parties are same as if no appeal had been entered. Fagan v. McTier, <cite class="ga_court">81 Ga. 73</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E. 177</cite> (1888); State Hwy. Bd. v. Long, <cite class="ga_app_court">61 Ga.

        <p>
       While appeal only suspends and does not vacate judgment allowing probate in solemn form, so that judgment may again become effective in event of dismissal of appeal, a dismissal of the case vitiates entire proceeding, leaving parties in same status as if no action was ever commenced to probate in solemn form. Hodges v. Libbey, <cite class="ga_app_court">120 Ga. App. 246</cite>, <cite class="app_court">170 S.E.2d 37</cite> (1969).

       Where plaintiff, appellee, obtains judgment on appeal, such judgment, as to priority, is to be treated as being of date when judgment appealed from was entered, and accordingly it takes precedence over another judgment rendered by superior court, older than judgment on appeal, but younger than original judgment entered in justice's court.

       - Under general law, an appeal is a de novo investigation, and it is error for the court to dismiss the appeal when there is no defect in appeal proceedings, and when the adverse party does not consent for appeal to be withdrawn or dismissed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In appeal from inferior court, or assessors in condemnation proceeding, to superior court, the law contemplates that if judgment is obtained in superior court the prevailing party is entitled to a superior court execution and aid of all processes of superior court to enforce the court's judgment. A dismissal of the entire case or proceedings with consent of court might be permissible under some circumstances, for this would be a final termination of the entire case or proceedings, but appellant cannot, at will and without consent of adverse party, certify case back to inferior court, or to assessors, and relegate adverse party to processes of inferior court. Such would be the effect of allowing appellant to withdraw the appellant's appeal without consent of adverse party contrary to statutory provisions. State Hwy. Bd. v. Long, <cite class="ga_app_court">61 Ga. App. 173</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E.2d 130</cite> (1939).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Property owners' claims against a county, the county's board of commissioners, and the county's officials were time-barred because, although the owners appeared and objected throughout a zoning process, the owners failed to file an appeal within 30 days of the zoning resolution that formed the basis of the owners' complaint as required by O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c03s5-3-20ol1a" target="_self">5-3-20(a)</a></cite>. Instead, the owners waited nearly three years to file a new action, asserting that the owners were entitled to do so because the actions of the zoning board were void. The owners could not be permitted to do indirectly that which the law did not allow to be done directly. Fortson v. Tucker, <cite class="ga_app_court">307 Ga.

       Summary judgment in favor of the county was affirmed because the action was filed more than 30 days after the letter was signed; thus, the trial court correctly determined that the action was untimely under O.C.G.A.

       - Probate court of county that did not have a population of more than 100,000 persons according to either the 1980 or 1990 decennial census lacked authority to entertain a motion for new trial, and any such motion therefore being without legal force and effect before the county probate court, would not serve to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal under either O.C.G.A.

   §
   1983 claim that the owner had a grandfathered constitutional right to rent a vacation home on a short-term basis that predated enactment of a county regulation; in order for the claim to succeed, it would have been necessary for the court of appeals to conclude that a state court in an earlier case wrongly decided that any constitutional challenge to application of the regulation was barred as untimely.

       - Where a notice of appeal from a probate court decision is filed in a timely fashion, the superior court is vested with discretion in determining whether to dismiss the appeal. If the superior court finds that the filing of the notice of appeal in superior court has caused an unreasonable as well as inexcusable delay in the transmission of the record from the probate court, the appeal should be dismissed.

       6-105 (see O.C.G.A.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Failure of clerk to exact costs
      
      when the clerk had recorded appeal will not operate as dismissal. Crawford v. Cate, <cite class="ga_court">20 Ga. 69</cite> (1856); Lyner v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">20 Ga. 773</cite> (1856); Fain v. Fain, <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga. App. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">346 S.E.2d 96</cite> (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       "Direct" means
      
      to give an order or command, not merely to advise or notify. Therefore, when the appellant was notified by the probate court of the obligation to pay court costs, but was not directed to pay costs by the court, the appellant's appeal should not have been dismissed for nonpayment of costs. Fain v. Fain, <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga. App. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">346 S.E.2d 96</cite> (1986).
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       When an appeal is withdrawn,
      
      judgment may be entered for costs but not amount due on execution. Bryan v. Simpson, <cite class="ga_court">92 Ga. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">18 S.E. 547</cite> (1893).

      In a dispossessory proceeding, because the case did not involve the tenant's failure to pay costs in the magistrate court, and, instead, involved the tenant's failure either to pay the filing fee owed in superior court or file an affidavit of poverty in that court, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c03s5-3-22" target="_self">5-3-22</a></cite> provided no basis for affirming the trial court's order denying the tenant's application to proceed in forma pauperis.

       <p>
        <p>
       - While a notice of appeal serves as supersedeas unless a bond is ordered by the court, a supersedeas bond is not, of itself, a notice of appeal.
   A bond may be required for security as a prerequisite to bringing an appeal but the bond does not, itself, commence the appeal. Sharpe v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">198 Ga. App. 381</cite>, <cite class="app_court">401 S.E.2d 586</cite> (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Failure to file supersedeas bond
       
       is no ground for dismissing appeal. Thornton v. Burson, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 456</cite>, <cite class="app_court">260 S.E.2d 388</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Failure to file supersedeas bond is no ground for dismissing appeal, even when the superior court finds such failure is willful. Hawn v. Chastain, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 723</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 135</cite> (1980).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Failure to file supersedeas bond simply means that judgment of trial court may be enforced. Thornton v. Burson, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 456</cite>, <cite class="app_court">260 S.E.2d 388</cite> (1979).

        <p>

        Intent of General Assembly that appeals not be dismissed for failure to post supersedeas bonds
       
       is clearly shown by subsection (a), which expressly authorizes dismissal of an appeal for nonpayment of costs accrued in a lower tribunal after the appellant has been directed by superior court to pay such costs. Hawn v. Chastain, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 723</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 135</cite> (1980).

        <p>
       - When a notice of appeal from a probate court decision is filed in a timely fashion, the superior court is vested with discretion in determining whether to dismiss the appeal. If the superior court finds that the filing of the notice of appeal in superior court has caused an unreasonable as well as inexcusable delay in the transmission of the record from the probate court, the appeal should be dismissed. Otherwise, the superior court is authorized to retain the appeal. In that event, the superior court has ample authority to enter an order directing that the probate court transmit the record to the superior court so that the appeal can be decided. Mack v. Demming, <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 117</cite>, <cite class="app_court">281 S.E.2d 591</cite> (1981).

        <p>
       Filing an independent suit, rather than a notice of appeal in the lower tribunal, was sufficient to vest the superior court with jurisdiction to decide an appeal from an adverse decision of the mayor and city council, and the superior court was bound to make the determination whether the procedural irregularity caused unreasonable or inexcusable delay.

       Superior court erred in setting aside the year's support award for failure to provide evidence of an amount sufficient to constitute a year's support because the only issue properly before the court on appeal under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c03s5-3-29" target="_self">5-3-29</a></cite> was whether an objection had been made to the petitioner's petition for year's support. Because the superior court found that no objection had been made to the petition for year's support, the court erred in placing the burden of proof to show the amount sufficient for year's support upon the petitioner.

         Distinction between statutory appeal on merits and appeal by writ of error.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Statutory appeal providing for another trial in appellate court on merits of case is altogether different from writ of error on appeal for correction of errors in trial eventuating in judgment from which appeal is taken. In latter proceeding inquiry is into correctness of judgment upon pleading and evidence before trial court. Appellate court affirms or reverses in whole or in part the judgment on review and certifies the result to the trial court, where final judgment is entered. That procedure has nothing in common with that of a statutory appeal. The statutory appeal allows litigants in certain cases the right to another trial in superior court upon compliance with certain requisites. Trial in superior court is had without reference to evidence introduced in former trial, and is a de novo investigation. City of Macon v. Ries, <cite class="ga_court">179 Ga. 320</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E. 21</cite> (1934).

        <p>
       - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the siblings on the basis that the challenging sister's claim against the estate seeking an accounting was time-barred because a question of fact remained as to whether the sister was on notice that they had claimed any estate property adversely to the sister; thus, a jury had to decide whether the 10-year bar of O.C.G.A.

       - Jury in superior court proceeding does not review and affirm or reverse rulings of probate judge, but hears all issues anew as if there had been no previous trial, and if the jury relies upon record below or allows the judgment below to influence the jury's decision, reversible error is committed.

        <p>
       - Appeal of an application for a year's support award by a probate court is a de novo proceeding in the superior court, and as such, the appeal is subject to the established procedures for civil actions, thus entitling a party to invoke summary judgment.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c03s5-3-30" target="_self">5-3-30</a></cite>, the Georgia legislature intended that appeals from the probate court to the superior court would continue without special limitations on the right to a jury trial; and (2) de novo appeals to the superior court from the probate court were to be tried by jury unless the right to a jury trial was waived, given that a widow specifically requested a jury trial, and hence did not waive the right, the trial court erred in denying the widow's request.

       - Where the appellants had sought a jury trial in a local magistrate court on the issue of possession in a landlord-tenant dispute, the appellee denied the appellants' request, the appellants filed a writ of prohibition against the appellee in the superior court, and the superior court denied the appellants' writ and issued a certificate of immediate review to the Supreme Court of Georgia, the magistrate court did not err in denying the appellants a jury trial, since the right to jury trial on appeal is expressly given in this Code section, and the appellants are not being denied a jury trial, but instead, only endure a procedural delay in the magistrate court before receiving a jury trial on appeal to the state or superior court.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c03s5-3-31" target="_self">5-3-31</a></cite> does not provide the exclusive remedy for imposition of sanctions for appeals to the superior court; the statute applies only to cases of appeal wherein the jury returns a verdict for a sum of money. Osofsky v. Board of Mayor &amp; Comm'rs, <cite class="ga_app_court">237 Ga. App. 404</cite>, <cite class="app_court">515 S.E.2d 413</cite> (1998).

        <p>

        To justify assessment of damages,
       
       appeal must be both frivolous and intended for delay. Gunnels v. Deavours, <cite class="ga_court">57 Ga. 177</cite> (1876).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Appeal is intended to delay only when entirely without merit and entered merely to postpone creditor in collection of debt. Clark v. Fee, <cite class="ga_court">86 Ga. 9</cite>, <cite class="app_court">12 S.E. 181</cite> (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Appellant's failure to submit evidence, by itself, is not conclusive
       
       of issue of intent to delay. Gilmore v. Wright, <cite class="ga_court">20 Ga. 198</cite> (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        In determining whether appeal is frivolous
       
       and intended to delay, the jury must consider all evidence. Garrison v. Wilcoxson, <cite class="ga_court">11 Ga. 154</cite> (1852).

       - It was the intention of the framers of the Constitution, and of the legislature, to provide writ of certiorari to superior courts to all persons dissatisfied with judgments of inferior judicatories and who desire to have those judgments corrected by the superior court. Cochran v. City of Rockmart, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 732</cite>, <cite class="app_court">251 S.E.2d 259</cite> (1978).

        - Plaintiff's action seeking to set aside a reprimand from defendant city employer via writ of certiorari was remanded to state court because the cause of action was a uniquely state remedy for writ of certiorari to the state court, the resolution of which could turn on a conclusion that the conduct in question was in violation of federal law; the fact that the state court may look to federal law to determine whether to grant the relief sought by plaintiff did not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal court.

        Federal district court did not err in concluding that university professor's procedural due process claim was actionable under 42 U.S.C.
   §
   1983 because the district court reached the plausible conclusion that the state courts may have summarily dismissed the professor's mandamus request without considering the merits thereof; while a writ of certiorari was not available to the professor upon the state court's determination that the termination proceedings were purely administrative, the professor was still entitled to seek a writ of mandamus.

        <p>
       - Writ of certiorari ordinarily furnishes a full and adequate remedy at law for correction of errors in decisions by municipal corporations, courts, or councils, rendered in exercise of judicial powers; so that even though a property right may be primarily involved in such manner as would authorize an injured party to resort to equity, the injured party is not entitled to claim such relief, when the injured party has already appeared before municipal judicatory, and that body has rendered an adverse decision.

       Superior court erred in dismissing the appellant's petition for certiorari in which the appellant sought review of a hearing officer's decision upholding the public housing authority's decision to terminate the appellant's Section 8 voucher benefits as the hearing officer's decision was subject to review on certiorari because the hearing officer's decision was the result of quasi-judicial action as the appellant had the right to proper notice and a fair hearing, the appellant was afforded the opportunity to present evidence under judicial forms of procedure, and the hearing officer made a decision after determining the facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard and applying the appropriate law.

       Trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to review, pursuant to a writ of certiorari, the termination of a city employee because a city manager was not acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in permitting an employee to present evidence prior to finalizing the city manager's decision to terminate the employee; the city charter and personnel ordinance did not grant city employees a right to pretermination hearings.

       In determining whether a writ of certiorari will lie to a decision or judgment of an inferior court, a paramount question for consideration is whether there was exercised a judicial function as distinguished from a ministerial act, for certiorari is available for correction of erroneous judgments in exercise of judicial powers, but ordinarily is not a proper remedy to correct errors relating to ministerial acts.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Judicial action is an adjudication upon rights of parties who in general appear or are brought before tribunal by notice or process, and upon whose claims some decision or judgment is rendered; it implies impartiality, disinterestedness, a weighing of adverse claims, and is inconsistent with discretion on one hand - for tribunal must decide according to law and rights of parties - or with dictation on the other; for in first instance the court must exercise the court's own judgment under the law, and not act under a mandate from another power.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In determining whether proceeding is judicial in character, question hinges not on whether parties at interest were in fact given an opportunity to be heard, but the test is whether parties at interest had a right under law to demand a trial in accordance with judicial procedures. South View Cem. Ass'n v. Hailey, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 863</cite> (1945); What It Is, Inc. v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_app_court">146 Ga.

        <p>
       - If a person or tribunal has right under proper delegated authority to act in judicial capacity, character of such judicial procedure, when had as prescribed, is not impaired because under the law such tribunal might have had alternative right to act ex parte without trial, but refused to exercise such right.

       - Statute giving county commissioners in certain counties power to grant or refuse permission to establish cemeteries outside limits of incorporated towns does not confer upon such commission the duties and functions of a court, so that writ of certiorari might issue from its action taken upon any such application; rather the commission's action is merely entertainment and refusal of a request pertaining to executive duties of commissioners, and fact that there is a trial, when none is authorized under statute, does not operate to change nature and character of procedure.

       <p>
        <p>

        Basic distinction between administrative and judicial act by officers other than judges
       
       is that a quasi-judicial action, contrary to an administrative function, is one in which all parties are as a matter of right entitled to notice and to a hearing, with opportunity afforded to present evidence under judicial forms of procedure; and that no one deprived of such rights is bound by action taken. South View Cem. Ass'n v. Hailey, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 478</cite>, <cite class="app_court">34 S.E.2d 863</cite> (1945).

       - Decision by a county board to grant a special use permit was a quasi-judicial decision because the process involved determining the facts and applying the county ordinance's legal standards to the permits, which was akin to a judicial act; the applicant therefore waived the applicant's challenge to two property owners' standing by failing to object before the board.

       - Because the police officer identified no evidence that employees seeking injured on the job benefits were entitled to notice, a hearing in accordance with judicial procedure, and an opportunity to present evidence, the police chief's action constituted the discretionary exercise of executive power; consequently, the superior court correctly determined that there was no judicial or quasi-judicial action below and properly dismissed the officer's petition for writ of certiorari under O.C.G.A.

       - Party excepting to judgment of ordinary (now judge of probate court) is entitled to have pointed out to the ordinary the alleged incorrect statement of fact in exceptions and to have opportunity to correct the errors or compel decision on exceptions as the exceptions stand, if exceptor is correct in the exceptor's contention that exceptions state facts.

       - When the distributee and creditor cite administrator for settlement and, after judgment in case, file exception to judgment with ordinary (now judge of probate court), refusal of ordinary to certify to exceptions for reason that facts set out in exceptions are not true, is not such a judgment overruling exceptions as to be the basis for a petition for writ of certiorari.

     <p>
      When either party in any case in any inferior judicatory or before any person exercising judicial powers is dissatisfied with the decision or judgment in the case, the party may apply for and obtain a writ of certiorari by petition to the superior court for the county in which the case was tried, in which petition he shall plainly and distinctly set forth the errors complained of. On the filing of the petition in the office of the clerk of the superior court, with the sanction of the appropriate judge endorsed thereon, together with the bond or affidavit, as provided in Code Section 5-4-5, it shall be the duty of the clerk to issue a writ of certiorari, directed to the tribunal or person whose decision or judgment is the subject matter of complaint, requiring the tribunal or person to certify and send up all the proceedings in the case to the superior court, as directed in the writ of certiorari.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Writ of certiorari ordinarily furnishes a full and adequate remedy at law for correction of errors in decisions by municipal corporations, courts, or councils, rendered in exercise of judicial powers; so that even though a property right may be primarily involved in such manner as would authorize injured party to resort to equity, one is not entitled to claim such relief, when one has already appeared before a municipal judicatory, and that body has rendered an adverse decision. Ballard v. Mayor of Carrollton, <cite class="ga_court">194 Ga. 489</cite>, <cite class="app_court">22 S.E.2d 81</cite> (1942).

       - When petition for certiorari to review judgment of justice of peace was sanctioned, but was never filed in office of clerk of superior court, petition was a mere nullity; and second petition for certiorari in same case, presented to judge of superior court within 30 days from date of judgment complained of, is not subject to dismissal on ground that petitioner has no legal right to present second petition for certiorari in same case.

       An assignment of error that this duty was not complied with must be sustained. Stoufer v. Missenheimer, <cite class="ga_app_court">26 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Failure of justice of peace to send up copies of proceedings in the justice's court when the proceedings are necessary to determination of cause is good ground for dismissal of certiorari; certiorari will not be dismissed because the magistrate fails to send up copies of proceedings when errors complained of in petition as verified by answer can be fully considered and determined without reference to such proceedings. Lynn v. Crapps, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 744</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 398</cite> (1933).

        <p>

        When the magistrate has failed to certify and send up proceedings in the case,
       
       assignment of error that duty was not complied with must be sustained. Stoufer v. Missenheimer, <cite class="ga_app_court">26 Ga.

        Remedy to review superior court judge's refusal to sanction petition for certiorari

       - Since the municipal court did not inquire into the defendant's understanding of the nature of the violation to which the defendant confessed guilt, and the record likewise did not show any factual basis for the plea independent of such an inquiry, the superior court erred in denying a writ of certiorari.

       - Trial court erred in upholding the decision of a recorder's court finding the defendant in contempt of the 2010 Order from an unrelated case because the uncontroverted evidence showed that the 2010 case against the defendant had been dismissed; thus, the recorder's court was divested of jurisdiction to consider the contempt motion as part of the 2013 enforcement action and lacked authority to enforce the 2010 Order, which was no longer in effect.

       - Certiorari is not an appropriate remedy to review or obtain relief from judgment, decision, or action of inferior judicatory or body rendered in exercise of legislative, executive, or ministerial functions. City of Cedartown v. Pickett, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 840</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E.2d 263</cite> (1942); Presnell v. McCollum, <cite class="ga_app_court">112 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       In determining whether a writ of certiorari will lie to a decision or judgment of an inferior court, a paramount question for consideration is whether there was exercised a judicial function as distinguished from a ministerial act, for certiorari is available for correction of erroneous judgments in exercise of judicial powers, but ordinarily is not a proper remedy to correct errors relating to ministerial acts. Hayes v. Brown, <cite class="ga_court">205 Ga. 234</cite>, <cite class="app_court">52 S.E.2d 862</cite> (1949).

       - Superior court erred in denying the city board of appeals' motion to dismiss a petition for writ of certiorari because there was a complete failure to even issue a writ of certiorari, let alone serve the writ upon the board as the respondent; and the petitioner failed to name the city as an opposite party, and failed to serve the city with a copy of the petition and with a copy of the writ in the time required.

       - Recorder's Court of Chatham County is not such a "like court" within the meaning of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c04s5-4-3" target="_self">5-4-3</a></cite> establishing this court's jurisdiction; therefore, the proper procedure for appealing from any decision of a recorder's court is by application for a writ of certiorari.

        <p>
       Local constitutional amendment vesting the recorder's court of a county with jurisdiction to take and entertain pleas of guilty in misdemeanor cases does not authorize a direct appeal to the Court of Appeals and the writ of certiorari is still the method of appealing the writ. Pough v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">162 Ga. App. 63</cite>, <cite class="app_court">290 S.E.2d 300</cite> (1982).
       </p>

       Proper method for obtaining review of a decision of a recorder's court is either by direct appeal to the superior court, in the case of traffic violations, or by application for certiorari to the superior court. Franklin v. Recorder's Court, <cite class="ga_app_court">174 Ga. App. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">330 S.E.2d 429</cite> (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's challenge to the defendant's misdemeanor traffic convictions by a motion to vacate was not an appropriate remedy, and the defendant's motion could not be construed as a motion for arrest of judgment or other alternative motion because the motion was untimely under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.40.html#t40c13s40-13-33ol1a" target="_blank">40-13-33(a)</a></cite>; the 180-day limit applied to any challenge that could have been brought by habeas corpus, and suspension of a driver's license interfered with a liberty interest.

        Hearing before county board of commissioners issuing "order" finding liability for business taxes
       
       and directing that a fieri facias be issued for the amount of taxes due does not constitute a decision of an inferior judicatory from which the taxpayer should petition for certiorari in the superior court where the hearing is not transcribed or recorded, but is memorialized only by the minutes of the meeting, the hearing is not conducted in accordance with judicial procedure, and the ordinance in question does not give an appellant as a matter of right a trial in accordance with judicial procedure. Accordingly, declaratory judgment relief is proper. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. DeKalb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">167 Ga.

       - Although the city board of appeals was served with a copy of the petition for certiorari, a sanction of the writ by the superior court, and summonses, the superior court erred in denying the board's motion to dismiss because there was a failure to comply with the statutory requirements as no writ had been issued and served; and, while it was the clerk's duty to issue the writ, it was also separately the duty of the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel to ensure that a writ was served, and the petitioner could not completely divorce itself from the failure that occurred in the current case.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Assignments of error must be specific whether contained in bill of exceptions or in petition for certiorari, and, when based upon decision of trial court, must specifically point out reason why decision is error. Wall v. Hawker Pottery Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">27 Ga. App. 255</cite>, <cite class="app_court">108 S.E. 134</cite> (1921).

       <p>
        <p>
       Mere general averment of error, in connection with which there is no statement or assignment whatever as to how or wherein rulings complained of were erroneous, presents no case or question for decision by judge of the superior court. Chan v. Judge, <cite class="ga_app_court">36 Ga. App. 13</cite>, <cite class="app_court">134 S.E. 925</cite> (1926); Davis v. Lee, <cite class="ga_app_court">38 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When verdict or judgment is complained of, assignment of error, unless judgment is on demurrer (now motion to dismiss) or similar pleading or on motion for new trial, must specifically point out wherein verdict or judgment is erroneous. Feckoury v. Maloney, <cite class="ga_app_court">40 Ga. App. 157</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E. 91</cite> (1929).

        General exception to judgment suffices when it is alleged error stems from erroneous antecedent ruling,

       - Petition for certiorari from recorder's court, seeking review by superior court of judgment, is fatally defective when the petition does not set out copy of ordinance upon which charge or summons is predicated, or else a denial of its existence. Wright v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">61 Ga. App. 650</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 215</cite> (1940).

       Defendant's petition for writ of certiorari was fatally and fundamentally flawed, as the writ did not recite the provisions of the statute under which defendant was convicted, so the appellate court had no context within which to review the evidence.

        <p>
       - When it is sought to review by certiorari a conviction on charge of having violated a municipal ordinance, existence of which is admitted in petition for certiorari, provisions of ordinance should be stated in petition, but it is not necessary that ordinance be literally copied therein. Childrey v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">62 Ga. App. 107</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 919</cite> (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because a city's petition for certiorari plainly and distinctly asserted the errors complained of, the superior court did not err in denying the city's motion to dismiss; moreover, the record reflected that the bar managers cited for violation of Atlanta, Ga., Code of Ordinances
   §
   10-46 (1995) preserved the issue as to the constitutionality of the ordinance and the ordinance's enforcement. City of Atlanta v. Jones, <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">640 S.E.2d 698</cite> (2006).

       Giving bond or making affidavit is condition precedent,
      
      in civil case, to issuance of writ. Page v. White, <cite class="ga_app_court">77 Ga. App. 21</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E.2d 662</cite> (1948).

      Filing of bond or making of pauper affidavit is condition precedent to application to superior court for writ of certiorari. Bickers v. Georgia Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="ga_app_court">89 Ga. App. 815</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1954).

       Petition must affirmatively show
      
      filing of bond or pauper affidavit and approval of clerk or judge. Bickers v. Georgia Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="ga_app_court">89 Ga. App. 815</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1954).

       <p>

       Failure to pay costs and give bond, or to make pauper's affidavit
      
      renders certiorari void. Quinn v. O'Neal, <cite class="ga_app_court">57 Ga. App. 248</cite>, <cite class="app_court">194 S.E. 911</cite> (1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Writ of certiorari in civil case is void when issued before applicant has given bond, or has made and filed affidavit in forma pauperis, in lieu of such bond. Page v. White, <cite class="ga_app_court">77 Ga. App. 21</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E.2d 662</cite> (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      When it affirmatively appears from petition for certiorari that there was failure to give bond or to make pauper affidavit, such failure renders the petition for certiorari void and an absolute nullity, and the petition cannot proceed. Bickers v. Georgia Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="ga_app_court">89 Ga. App. 815</cite>, <cite class="app_court">81 S.E.2d 535</cite> (1954).

      <p>
       <p>
      Court was correct in dismissing petition for writ of certiorari when it affirmatively appeared from the petition that no attempt had been made to comply with requirements of section relative to making of proper bond or execution of proper pauper's affidavit.

        <p>
       - When party taking bond is State Personnel Board, by a majority of the board's members, nothing in the law gives it the right to delegate the board's right to justification by surety to any other officer. The board alone has power to approve or disapprove bond, and such authority cannot be exercised even by judge of superior court, or by clerk of trial court. When there is no approval of bond by judicial officer, writ must be dismissed. Scott v. Oxford, <cite class="ga_app_court">105 Ga.

        <p>

        Best way to show that proper bond has been given
       
       is to attach to petition a certified copy of the bond, with certificate of approval by proper officer, and allege affirmatively that bond was given and approved as required by law. Beard v.

       Although a trial court's decision to dismiss an action by dismissed city employees was erroneously based on the court's determination that the employees had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies from their claim that the reduction-in-force ordinance, Atlanta, Ga., Code
   §
   114-55, was not properly followed, as they had properly appealed to the Service Board and the Board had denied their claims on appeal, the dismissal was proper for other reasons; after the Board's final decision denying the employees' appeals, the employees failed to properly and timely file a writ of certiorari in the trial court pursuant to O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - When verdict and judgment rendered in Municipal Court of Atlanta is not a final judgment, neither judgment of trial judge overruling motion for new trial excepting to such verdict and judgment, nor judgment of appellate division of that court affirming such judgment of trial judge, is a final judgment.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Because certiorari and mandamus are completely different remedies as to subject matter, procedure, and nature of relief, filing a mandamus action does not excuse compliance with requirements of this section.

        <p>
       - Mandamus was not the appropriate remedy for homeowners whose building permit had been denied by a city; rather, the homeowners were required to pursue the homeowners' appeal through the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari, pursuant to Statesboro, Ga., Zoning Ordinance

       - This section merely limits time after final judgment in which writ of certiorari may be applied for, but does not attempt to go into manner in which exceptions to orders and rulings prior to final judgment may be preserved. Taylor v. Golian Steel &amp; Iron Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">86 Ga. App. 639</cite>, <cite class="app_court">72 S.E.2d 196</cite> (1952).

       - It is from verdict of jury in appeal cases in justice's court that certiorari may be taken, not from judgment which justice may enter thereon. Western &amp; A.R.R. v. Carson, <cite class="ga_court">70 Ga. 388</cite> (1883).

       - When certiorari is applied for after expiration of statutory period from date of judgment complained of, petition should show on the petition's face that the petition is a renewal of a previously dismissed certiorari sued out within proper time in same cause, and that renewal is within six months from date of dismissal of previous certiorari. Unless all of these facts appear in petition for certiorari, the judge of superior court has no jurisdiction of case, and should refuse to sanction petition; and, if such petition is sanctioned, it should be dismissed when proper motion therefor is made upon hearing of certiorari.

      and then only to correct errors which affect such final judgment. It does not lie to correct errors affecting only judgment which is not final. Reed v. V.H. Kriegshaber &amp; Son, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 64</cite>, <cite class="app_court">160 S.E. 560</cite> (1931).

       - In certiorari case, answer of trial judge is only source from which knowledge of facts of case and rulings therein can be derived by reviewing court. Adams v. Bishop, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 32</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E. 460</cite> (1932).

       Better practice when trial judge does not care to categorically admit or deny allegations
      
      of various paragraphs of petition for certiorari, but desires to stand on stenographic report of proceedings as truth of matters alleged, is in the judge's answer to each paragraph containing allegations as to evidence, objections of counsel, and rulings of the court, to quote pertinent part of report in reference to allegations made in each paragraph, instead of merely admitting allegations except insofar as the allegations may conflict with stenographic report attached. Lunsford v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">60 Ga. App. 537</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 112</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933,

       - Function of exceptions to answer of magistrate to petition for certiorari is to specify defects in such answer, and such exceptions do not take place of traverse to answer whose function is to controvert truth of facts set forth in answer.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Upon trial of certiorari when judge's answer to petition is untraversed, judge of superior court must take as true the statement of facts and evidence adduced upon the trial of case as contained in an answer and in those portions of the petition for certiorari verified thereby as true. West v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 71</cite>, <cite class="app_court">118 S.E.2d 491</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although the statute does not require that the answer be traversed, if no traverse is filed, the answer becomes conclusive as to recitals of fact contained therein, and the answer becomes the record on which the superior court is authorized to rule on the merits of the petition. Bembry v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_app_court">152 Ga. App. 422</cite>, <cite class="app_court">263 S.E.2d 229</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although a traverse to an answer is now optional, the recitals of fact contained in the answer are rendered conclusive when neither a traverse nor an exception is filed. This being so, the court is entitled to rely upon the factual recitals of the answer as a part of the record, and to use the recitals as a basis for the court's findings. Cox v. City of Lawrenceville, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga. App. 119</cite>, <cite class="app_court">308 S.E.2d 224</cite> (1983).

         Absent exceptions, improper answer by trial judge will cause dismissal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When there is an improper or incomplete answer by a trial judge to petition for certiorari, the judge of the superior court will not continue hearing on certiorari until answer is perfected and certiorari will be dismissed, unless exceptions thereto have been filed as provided in this section. Norris v. Sibert &amp; Robinson, <cite class="ga_app_court">53 Ga. App. 440</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E. 199</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When answer does not show that final judgment was rendered,
       
       judge may dismiss proceeding. Southern Ry. v. Leggett &amp; Co., <cite class="ga_court">117 Ga. 31</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E. 421</cite> (1903); Hill v. Anderson Banking Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">18 Ga. App. 41</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E. 749</cite> (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Exceptions will lie only when omissions are material
       
       to proper decision of case. Hardy v. Hardy, <cite class="ga_app_court">2 Ga. App. 530</cite>, <cite class="app_court">58 S.E. 779</cite> (1907).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When copies of pleading and other part of record are not certified and sent up with answer, it is error to overrule exceptions. Stoufer v. Missenheimer, <cite class="ga_app_court">26 Ga. App. 554</cite>, <cite class="app_court">106 S.E. 560</cite> (1921), later appeal, <cite class="ga_app_court">28 Ga. App. 350</cite>, <cite class="app_court">111 S.E. 692</cite> (1922).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When, in certiorari proceeding, record does not show that any copy of proceedings was sent up with answer of trial judge, although statement of judge indicates intention to attach such papers, answer is incomplete in that respect. But if applicant for certiorari desires such information before superior court, it is the applicant's duty to except to the answer in order that the judge might be required to complete the answer. Beavers v. Cassells, <cite class="ga_app_court">56 Ga. App. 146</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 249</cite> (1937), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">186 Ga. 98</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E. 716</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Oral objection that answer of retired magistrate is not verified is sustainable.
       
       Love v. Bush, <cite class="ga_app_court">21 Ga. App. 436</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E. 626</cite> (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Additional answer prepared before exceptions to original answer are sustained
       
       cannot become part of record, if objected to. Bailey v. Ware &amp; Harper, <cite class="ga_app_court">17 Ga. App. 492</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E. 712</cite> (1916), later appeal, <cite class="ga_app_court">19 Ga. App. 255</cite>, <cite class="app_court">91 S.E. 282</cite> (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When exceptions and traverse are both filed,
       
       court should dispose of exceptions first. Chandler v. Baggett, <cite class="ga_app_court">13 Ga. App. 333</cite>, <cite class="app_court">79 S.E. 179</cite> (1913).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Question of freight charges not raised in justice's court on trial cannot properly be raised in superior court or Court of Appeals. Fine &amp; Bro. v. Southern Express Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">10 Ga. App. 161</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E. 35</cite> (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Writ of certiorari lies only for correction of errors committed in trial court, and no question, unless first raised there, can be considered by superior court or by this court. Cohen v. Finkovitch, <cite class="ga_app_court">40 Ga. App. 94</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E. 66</cite> (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When it does not appear from record that certain issues were raised in the trial court, the issues cannot be raised by certiorari in the superior court. Bell v. City of Valdosta, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 808</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 572</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Issues neither raised at trial nor in certiorari petition cannot be reviewed by Court of Appeals. Bell v. City of Valdosta, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 808</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 572</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When issue not raised in petition for certiorari nor considered by the trial court, the appellate court is without authority to review the petition. Hodnett v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">145 Ga. App. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">243 S.E.2d 605</cite> (1978).

       <p>
        <p>

        Admission of illegal evidence at trial without objection
       
       is not ground for certiorari when both parties were represented by counsel. Cohen v. Finkovitch, <cite class="ga_app_court">40 Ga. App. 94</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E. 66</cite> (1929).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Petition which fails to point out as erroneous any specific ruling of judge who tried case, and which does not complain specifically of any ruling that was made by the judge during the trial, is properly dismissed. Cohen v. Finkovitch, <cite class="ga_app_court">40 Ga. App. 94</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E. 66</cite> (1929).
       </p>

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because a city's petition for certiorari plainly and distinctly asserted the errors complained of, the superior court did not err in denying the city's motion to dismiss; moreover, the record reflected that the bar managers cited for violation of Atlanta, Ga., Code of Ordinances
   §
   10-46 (1995) preserved the issue as to the constitutionality of the ordinance and the ordinance's enforcement. City of Atlanta v. Jones, <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">640 S.E.2d 698</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Assignment of error that verdict was contrary to or unsupported by evidence
       
       is sufficient. Gresham v. Lee, <cite class="ga_app_court">28 Ga. App. 576</cite>, <cite class="app_court">112 S.E. 524</cite> (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Assignment of error that verdict is contrary to law,
       
       truth, and justice is insufficient and dismissal is proper. Taft Co. v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">112 Ga. 196</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E. 424</cite> (1900); Callaway v. City of Atlanta, <cite class="ga_app_court">6 Ga. App. 354</cite>, <cite class="app_court">64 S.E. 1105</cite> (1909); Huson v. Farmer, <cite class="ga_app_court">53 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When only error assigned is that dismissal below was erroneous,
       
       dismissal of petition will result. Hicks v. Smith, <cite class="ga_app_court">28 Ga. App. 594</cite>, <cite class="app_court">112 S.E. 295</cite> (1922).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c04s5-4-12" target="_self">5-4-12</a></cite> prescribes the use of the "substantial evidence" test. Graham v. Wilkes, <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 402</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 90</cite> (1988).

        <p>
       - Standard of appellate court review of superior court decisions, that of "some" or "any evidence," is not intended to supervene or diminish the requirement that an administrative ruling be supported by substantial evidence. Wherever evidence before the administrative board is equivocal, the superior court errs in denying certiorari to determine whether the administrative board's ruling is supported by substantial evidence. Guntharp v. Cobb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga. App. 33</cite>, <cite class="app_court">307 S.E.2d 925</cite> (1983).

        Hearing before county board of commissioners issuing "order" finding liability for business taxes
       
       and directing that a fieri facias be issued for the amount of taxes due does not constitute a decision of an inferior judicatory from which the taxpayer should petition for certiorari in the superior court when the hearing is not transcribed or recorded, but is memorialized only by the minutes of the meeting, the hearing is not conducted in accordance with judicial procedure, and the ordinance in question does not give an appellant as a matter of right a trial in accordance with judicial procedure. Accordingly, declaratory judgment relief is proper. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. DeKalb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">167 Ga.

       Petition for certiorari containing allegation that there was failure to prove venue suffices,

       - When there is no distinct allegation of failure to prove venue in the trial court in a petition of certiorari to the superior court and no distinct brief of plaintiff in error, this section prohibits raising of question of lack of proof of venue for first time in Court of Appeals. Sturman v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">59 Ga. App. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 467</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Where lack of proof of venue is not specifically raised by any general or special grounds of motion for new trial, that question may not be presented to the Court of Appeals. Charles v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">64 Ga. App. 265</cite>, <cite class="app_court">13 S.E.2d 44</cite> (1941).

       - It would seem that the word "dismiss" under this section is in fact used in the sense synonymous with "overrule." Ray v. Cruce, <cite class="ga_app_court">21 Ga. App. 539</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E. 899</cite> (1918).

        When judge's order uses "denied" instead of "dismissed,"

        Failure of judge to file proper answer

       - Failure of justice of peace to send up copies of proceedings in the justice's court when the copies are necessary to determination of cause is good ground for dismissal of certiorari, but certiorari will not be dismissed when the magistrate fails to send up copies of proceedings when errors complained of in petition, as verified by answer can be fully considered and determined without reference to such proceedings.

      In case when only error alleged is that verdict is contrary to law and evidence, it is erroneous to render final judgment in petitioner's favor, for the reason that in such case error complained of is not one of law which must finally govern the case. Tuten v. Towles, <cite class="ga_app_court">36 Ga. App. 328</cite>, <cite class="app_court">136 S.E. 537</cite> (1927).

      When final determination of case tried in inferior court and carried by certiorari to superior court does not depend upon any controlling question of law, and there are issues of fact involved, superior court has no authority to render final judgment therein, although it may clearly appear from facts disclosed by record that verdict rendered in lower court was without evidence to support it. Smith v. J.J. Williamson &amp; Sons, <cite class="ga_app_court">43 Ga. App. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">159 S.E. 912</cite> (1931).

       - When, upon conviction in criminal court of county, defendant applied for writ of certiorari to superior court of county on ground that state had failed to establish venue of case, and upon hearing, state admitted the state's failure to establish venue, it is proper for the superior court to sustain certiorari and remand the case to the trial court for another trial, and it is not proper for the superior court in such case to enter final judgment therein, as error complained of is not an error of law which must finally govern the case, and it cannot be known with certainty that evidence on another trial would be the same.

       Any person who has been convicted of any criminal or quasi-criminal offense or violation of any ordinance, in any inferior judicatory by whatever name called, except constitutional city courts or state courts, exercising criminal or quasi-criminal jurisdiction, who desires a writ of certiorari to review and correct the judgment of conviction in the case shall be entitled to a supersedeas of the judgment if he files with the clerk of the court, or, if there is no clerk, with the judge thereof, or with the commissioners if it is a court presided over by commissioners with no clerk, a bond payable to the state, or, if the conviction is in a municipal court, payable to the municipality, in amount and with security acceptable to and to be approved by the clerk, judge, or majority of the commissioners, as the case may be, conditioned that the defendant will personally appear and abide the final judgment, order, or sentence upon him in the case. The bond, if payable to the state, may be forfeited in the same manner as any other criminal bond in any court having jurisdiction. If the bond is payable to the municipal corporation, it may be forfeited according to the procedure prescribed in the municipal ordinance or charter. Alternatively, an action may be brought on the bond in any court having jurisdiction. Upon the giving of bond the defendant shall be released from custody in like manner as defendants are released upon supersedeas bonds in criminal cases where a notice of appeal has been filed.

       The supersedeas provided for in this Code section shall operate to suspend the judgment of conviction until the case is finally heard and determined by the superior court to which it is taken by certiorari or by the Court of Appeals upon appeal, provided that within the time prescribed by law the defendant shall apply for and procure the writs and remedies provided by law for reviewing the judgment complained of. The supersedeas shall be equally applicable whether the judge of the superior court to whom the petition for certiorari is presented sanctions it or refuses it, provided that within the time provided by law the defendant diligently files a notice of appeal.

       The object of this Code section is to provide a method by which a defendant may obtain a supersedeas so long as he is prosecuting or is entitled under the law to prosecute the proceeding brought or to be brought to review the conviction of which he is complaining, or any intermediate appellate judgment rendered thereon, in order that the defendant shall not be deprived of his right to apply to the courts by being compelled to serve his sentence or pay a fine before he has had the full opportunity allowed him by law of taking the necessary proceedings to correct and review his conviction.

       - Bonds filed by defendants in municipal trial court, naming therein as obligee the Governor of Georgia and the Governor's successor in office are not legal bonds as are contemplated under provisions of this section, and failure of petitioners to give proper bond rendered the petition for certiorari void.

       - While certificate from clerk or presiding officer of trial court that bond has been accepted and approved should be accepted as prima facie true, it is not conclusive that proper bond has been given; and if bond itself is sent up with the record and shows on the bond's face that legal bond has not been given, certiorari should be dismissed.

       - In a dispossessory action, a municipal court erred in holding that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear a motion for new trial under O.C.G.A.
   §

   §

        New trials are granted by superior court as a court,
       
       not by a presiding judge in the judge's capacity as judge. Allen v. State, <cite class="ga_court">102 Ga. 619</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E. 470</cite> (1897) (decided under former Penal Code 1895,

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court is vested with discretion in granting new trials. Martin &amp; Sons v. Bank of Leesburg, <cite class="ga_court">137 Ga. 285</cite>, <cite class="app_court">73 S.E. 387</cite> (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When trial judge refuses to order new trial on ground of inadequate damages in tort action, this court will interfere with that discretion only in case of manifest abuse. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga. App. 437</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 236</cite> (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant did not rebut the presumption that counsel's conduct was within the broad range of professional conduct, because the trial court considered and rejected counsel's motion for a mistrial, and because an eyewitness could testify about the certainty of the eyewitness's identification, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Greenwood v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">309 Ga. App. 893</cite>, <cite class="app_court">714 S.E.2d 602</cite> (2011).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Although city court may have power to grant new trials, it is an inferior court whose final judgments may be reviewed by superior court upon certiorari. Archie v. State, <cite class="ga_court">99 Ga. 23</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E. 612</cite> (1896).

       First grant of new trial by judge of superior court is never disturbed by appellate court, unless it is made to appear that in doing so the judge manifestly abused the discretion resting in the judge.

        <p>
       - New trial should not be granted based on mere difference of opinion between appellate court and jury as to amount of recovery in action of tort for unliquidated damages. Something more must be disclosed to warrant interference, when substantial damages have been returned. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga.

       - When amount of verdict, though less than appellate court would have approved, does not afford such evidence of bias, passion, prejudice, or mistake as to justify setting the verdict aside as inadequate, the appellate court must affirm the verdict. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga. App. 437</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 236</cite> (1944).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - In interpreting language of order overruling motion for new trial, appellate court must presume that trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict devolving upon the judge, and that in overruling motion the judge did exercise this discretion, unless language of order indicates to the contrary and that court agreed to verdict against the court's own judgment and against dictates of the judge's own conscience, merely because the judge did not feel that the judge had the duty or authority to override findings of jury upon disputed issues of fact. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga. App. 437</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E. 236</cite> (1944).

Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga. App. 437</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E. 236</cite> (1944).

        <p>
       - Before verdict becomes final the verdict should, when losing party requires it by motion for new trial, receive approval of mind and conscience of trial judge. Until the judge's approval is given, the verdict does not become binding in a case when motion for new trial contains general grounds. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga.

       - When appellant filed a motion in probate court to set aside or amend the probate of a will due to newly discovered evidence of a later will, the probate court properly dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction when the appellant was not a party to the original probate; on appeal, the jurisdiction of the superior court was limited to that of the probate court.

    Each special ground of motion for new trial must be complete within itself; and when so incomplete as to require reference to brief of evidence, or to some other portion of record, in order to determine what was alleged error and whether such error was material, ground will not be considered by reviewing court.

    - Constitutionality of statute cannot be raised for first time in motion for new trial, but when the charge is given to the jury based upon statute which is unconstitutional, and counsel could not know nor anticipate that substance of statute would be given in charge to jury, counsel were not bound to raise question of constitutionality of statute before charge was given, and could assign error upon charge in motion for new trial.

      Judge cannot modify verdict after verdict's receipt and jury's disbursement.

    - If judge is not satisfied that verdict is returned is proper, before receiving verdict the judge may require the jury to return to room and correct the jury's verdict, under proper instructions from court or, after verdict is received and recorded and jury dispersed, the judge may grant a new trial. But the judge is without power to change and modify verdict after the verdict is received and recorded, and jury has dispersed. Ballard v. Turner, <cite class="ga_app_court">147 Ga.

       - Denial of a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary to the evidence addresses itself only to the discretion of the trial judge. Witt v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 564</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 145</cite> (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as the defendant did not show that the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel because the evidence was so overwhelming against the defendant that there was not a reasonable probability that the subpoena of the witness and the witness's testimony at trial would have produced a different result; in other words, the defendant did not show that the defendant was prejudiced by the alleged deficiency of defense counsel's failure to subpoena a witness. Cain v. State, <cite class="ga_court">277 Ga. 309</cite>, <cite class="app_court">588 S.E.2d 707</cite> (2003), overruled in part by Dickens v.

       Evidence supported the defendant's malice murder conviction when the defendant shot the victim because the defendant believed the victim took $400 and the defendant's phone, given that a witness saw the defendant meet the victim at the door of the defendant's house, call the victim a bitch, and yank the victim's arm, then the witness heard a gunshot, and the defendant admitted shooting the victim but claimed it was accidental. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in denying a motion for new trial on general grounds. Smith v. State, <cite class="ga_court">300 Ga. 532</cite>, <cite class="app_court">796 S.E.2d 671</cite> (2017).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When faced with a motion for new trial based on general grounds, the trial court had the duty to exercise the court's discretion and weigh the evidence. The trial court did not exercise the court's discretion when the court evaluated the general grounds by applying the standard of Jackson v. Virginia, <cite class="us_code">443 U.S. 307</cite> (1979) to a motion for new trial based on the general grounds embodied in O.C.G.A.
   §§

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court failed to apply the proper standard in assessing the weight of the evidence as requested by the defendant in the defendant's motion for new trial, requiring remand for the trial court to apply the proper standard to the general grounds and to exercise the court's discretion to sit as a thirteenth juror pursuant to O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       Although the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant as a party of sexual exploitation of children, aggravated sodomy, child molestation, and first degree cruelty to children, the judgment was vacated because the successor judge erred in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial as there was no evidence that the successor judge reviewed the evidence under the appropriate discretionary standard in determining whether the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence or offended the principles of justice and equity. Wiggins v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">330 Ga. App. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">767 S.E.2d 798</cite> (2014).

       - Before verdict becomes final the verdict should, when the losing party requires it by motion for new trial, receive approval of mind and conscience of trial judge. Until the judge's approval is given, the verdict does not become binding in case when motion for new trial contains general grounds. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga.

       - When, in former suit between same parties and relating to same subject matter, verdict was rendered against party, whose motion for new trial was afterwards voluntarily dismissed, a petition subsequently brought by such party to review and set aside verdict is properly dismissed on general demurrer (now motion to dismiss), when it appears that grounds for review were such as were known, or could by reasonable diligence have been discovered in time to incorporate those grounds in motion for new trial made in former case.

       - When trial judge denies motion for new trial on general grounds, the judge finds that the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence and therefore, of necessity, that there is evidence to support the verdict.

       - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial, as the evidence presented, when coupled with the victim's clear and unfettered identification of the defendant from a photo array, which was not impermissibly suggestive, supported the defendant's convictions, and the defendant failed to show that trial counsel, who had over 30 years of criminal defense experience, was ineffective and that there was a reasonable likelihood that but for the alleged errors, the outcome would have been different.

       Although the condemnee claimed that the verdict was contrary to law and the evidence because the Department of Transportation's (DOT) expert failed to give any value to the condemnee's loss of access to approximately 3,800 feet of frontage, the condemnee's claim failed because the record reflected that the expert explained that any access to the DOT bypass along the approximately 3,811 feet of frontage taken along with the 13.022 acres would be limited by the bypass itself and that the condemnee never owned access rights to the bypass. Moreover, the expert explained further that the frontage had been considered in the valuation of the property. RNW Family P'ship, Ltd. v. DOT, <cite class="ga_app_court">307 Ga.

       - It is correct for the trial court to deny a motion for new trial when it cannot be said that the verdict of the jury was contrary to the evidence and without evidence to support the verdict. Hill Aircraft &amp; Leasing Corp. v. Tyler, <cite class="ga_app_court">161 Ga. App. 267</cite>, <cite class="app_court">291 S.E.2d 6</cite> (1982).

       <p>
        <p>
       Specific reference to defendant's general grounds argument, coupled with the trial court's statements concerning the nature and quantum of the evidence, established that the trial court did, in fact, consider whether the verdict was contrary to or against the weight of the evidence under the proper legal standard, and the trial court did fulfill its role to sit as the thirteenth juror when it denied defendant's motion for a new trial.

       - Trial court failed to apply the proper standard in assessing the weight of the evidence as requested by the defendant in the motion for new trial and, thus, remand was necessary for the trial court to apply the proper standard to the general grounds and to exercise the court's discretion to sit as a "thirteenth juror".

       - Because there was expert evidence that supported a finding of negligence and causation against physicians and their employers in a medical malpractice action by a patient, a verdict in the physicians' favor was not absolutely demanded, and the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in granting the patient's motion for new trial, pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       - In interpreting language of order overruling motion for new trial, the appellate court must presume that the trial judge knew rule as to obligation to approve jury's verdict devolving upon the judge, and that in overruling motion the judge did exercise this discretion, unless language of order indicates to contrary and that court agreed to verdict against the judge's own judgment and against dictates of the judge's own conscience, merely because the judge did not feel that the judge had the duty or authority to override findings of the jury upon disputed issues of fact.

       Contrary to the defendant's argument, the trial court reviewed the defendant's motion for new trial under the discretionary thirteenth juror standard based on the court's own independent review of the trial record and finding no discrepancy between the jury's conclusions regarding the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses and the court's own views of those matters; moreover, the transcript showed clearly that the court understood the court's obligations as the so-called thirteenth juror.

       While appellate division of Municipal Court of Atlanta may, as any other court of review, grant a new trial when there is no evidence to support the verdict, since there was some evidence on which the verdict could be based, and such verdict had the approval of the trial judge, the appellate division of the Municipal Court of Atlanta erred in granting a new trial.

       In passing upon general grounds of motion for new trial, appellate court will not disturb trial court's refusal to grant new trial if there is any evidence to support the judgment. Hopkins v. Sicro, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 691</cite>, <cite class="app_court">131 S.E.2d 243</cite> (1963).

        Defendant could challenge the sufficiency of the evidence
       
       by appealing the denial of the defendant's motion for new trial, even though the defendant did not invoke such a ruling from the court at trial. Jones v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">219 Ga. App. 780</cite>, <cite class="app_court">466 S.E.2d 667</cite> (1996).

       Because two witnesses heard the defendant threaten to use a gun moments prior to the shooting, and eyewitnesses saw the defendant shoot the victim, the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of malice murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting death of the victim, and the trial court did not err when the court denied the defendant's motion for new trial.

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because neither the trial court's order nor the court's statement during the hearing that it was "just going to stick by what the jury did," demonstrated that the court failed to exercise the discretion afforded to the court under O.C.G.A.

        Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for a new trial because sufficient evidence supported the defendant's convictions for arson and aggravated assault based on the testimony of the witnesses who testified that the witnesses could see the defendant starting the fire through the kitchen windows and witnessed the defendant shoot a shotgun in the direction of a neighbor and four law enforcement officers who were at the scene as well as the defendant's admission that the defendant set the fire.

        Denial of defendant's motion for new trial was reversed
       
       as the defendant's right to be present at trial under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XII was violated when the trial court questioned a juror in chambers without defense counsel or the prosecutor present, dismissed the juror, and replaced the juror with an alternate; the defendant did not acquiesce in the illegal proceedings and repudiated counsel's silent waiver of the juror's rights at the juror's first opportunity, the hearing on a motion for a new trial, at which the defendant was represented by new counsel.

       Although the trial court exercised the court's discretion as the thirteenth juror to assess the credibility of at least one witness, the court failed to properly fulfill the court's affirmative statutory duty to independently weigh the trial evidence and identify any offending testimony. It was incumbent upon the trial court to then examine and weigh the remaining evidence and independently consider whether the jury's verdict was contrary to the evidence or was against the weight of the evidence. State v. Reid, <cite class="ga_app_court">331 Ga. App. 275</cite>, <cite class="app_court">770 S.E.2d 665</cite> (2015).

       Trial court erred by denying the appellant's motion for a new trial because the motion hearing transcript clearly showed that the appellant requested the trial court to exercise the court's discretion to review the evidence as a thirteenth juror, but in the court's order denying the motion, the trial court stated that, "The testimony and the other evidence introduced at trial was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt," which was not the proper standard of review. Gomillion v. State, <cite class="ga_court">296 Ga. 678</cite>, <cite class="app_court">769 S.E.2d 914</cite> (2015).

       Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial made only the legal determination that the evidence was sufficient under Jackson v. Virginia, and did not show that the successor judge exercised discretion, weighed evidence, and acted as the thirteenth juror in determining whether the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence or offended the principles of justice and equity.

       - It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a new trial motion brought by a trustee who was found to have breached the trustee's fiduciary duty to trust beneficiaries by making distributions to a cotrustee under a trust's encroachment provision because the trustee breached the trustee's duty to protect the trust corpus as: (1) the trustee inconsistently required the cotrustee to provide supporting evidence for corpus distributions and let the cotrustee exceed an allotted budget; and (2) the beneficiaries were damaged by the resulting reduction in trust corpus.

        - Barring error by the trial court, the jury's verdict must be upheld unless it can be shown that there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to appellees, and clothing the verdict with all reasonable inferences to be deduced therefrom. Thus, the United States Court of Appeals' sole function is to ascertain if there is a rational basis in the record for the jury's verdict. Columbus Bank & Trust Co. v.

       Defendant's argument that the verdict convicting the defendant of the involuntary manslaughter of defendant's 17-month-old son was decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence could only be made to a trial court in a motion for new trial, not to an appellate court on appeal.

       When faced with a motion for new trial based on general grounds, the trial court had the duty to exercise the court's discretion and weigh the evidence. The trial court did not exercise the court's discretion when the court evaluated the general grounds by applying the standard of Jackson v.

       Because the trial court expressly and incorrectly stated that the defendant had not advanced the issue that the trial court did not act as the thirteenth juror, the trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, and the case was remanded solely for the trial court to consider the court's discretion to sit as the thirteenth juror.

        On motion for new trial, court may weigh evidence and consider credibility of witnesses.

       - Trial judge fails to exercise the discretion vested in the judge by law when the judge agrees that the amounts awarded to the plaintiff by the jury are excessive but refuses to set the amount aside or order a new trial on the basis that the judge does not want to impose the judge's opinion upon the jury.

       - After the defendant was found guilty of felony murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting death of the defendant's ex-husband, the trial court properly exercised the court's discretion to grant the defendant a new trial on the general grounds because the court concluded that the jury's guilty verdicts were decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence and contrary to the principles of justice and equity; and the supreme court would not disturb the first grant of a new trial based on the general grounds unless the trial court abused the court's discretion in granting it and the law and the facts demanded the verdict rendered.

       Trial court was aware of the court's responsibility as the "thirteenth juror" and, despite the court's mention of the sufficiency of the evidence at trial, the court exercised the court's discretion accordingly when denying the defendant's motion for a new trial after citing personal observations of witnesses and evidence at trial.

         Denial of motion for new trial improper.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial made only the legal determination that the evidence was sufficient under Jackson v. Virginia, <cite class="us_code">443 U.S. 307</cite> (1979), and did not show that the successor judge exercised discretion, weighed evidence, and acted as the thirteenth juror in determining whether the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence or offended the principles of justice and equity. Wiggins v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">330 Ga. App. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">767 S.E.2d 798</cite> (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court erred by denying the appellant's motion for a new trial because the motion hearing transcript clearly showed that the appellant requested the trial court to exercise the court's discretion to review the evidence as a thirteenth juror, but in the court's order denying the motion, the trial court stated that, "The testimony and the other evidence introduced at trial was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt," which was not the proper standard of review.

       If evidence is admissible for any purpose, the admission of that evidence will not cause a new trial.

        <p>
       - Error of admitting illegal evidence must be such as induced or largely contributed to erroneous finding, and such error that if new trial is granted, result should in all probability be different on another trial. Daughtry v. Savannah &amp; S. Ry., <cite class="ga_app_court">1 Ga. App. 393</cite>, <cite class="app_court">58 S.E. 230</cite> (1907).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When evidence is overwhelming that the defendant is guilty, even errors in admission or rejection of testimony will not operate so as to require new trial. Brannon v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">21 Ga. App. 328</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E. 259</cite> (1917), cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">21 Ga. App. 825</cite> (1918). But see Thigpen v. Batts, <cite class="ga_court">199 Ga. 161</cite>, <cite class="app_court">33 S.E.2d 424</cite> (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When evidence rejected relates to matter collateral to main transaction, and evidence touching main transaction makes a clear case of guilt, rejection of such evidence does not in all cases require grant of new trial. Green v. State, <cite class="ga_court">154 Ga. 117</cite>, <cite class="app_court">113 S.E. 536</cite> (1922).

        <p>
       - Although pleadings may not present whole issue, if it is fully made by evidence without objection, it is too late, after verdict, for losing party, to make that the ground of a motion for new trial.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because an accomplice's testimony was corroborated by defendant's recent possession of a stolen boat as well as defendant's flight from the scene of the crime, the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of theft by taking; consequently, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial. Johnson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">275 Ga. App. 161</cite>, <cite class="app_court">620 S.E.2d 433</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       There was sufficient evidence to support a defendant's conviction for felony murder of the love interest of the defendant's spouse, and the trial court did not err by denying the defendant's motions for a directed verdict or for a new trial; the trial court properly concluded that the defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial based on the testimony of a state psychiatrist who determined that the defendant had some intellectual limitations and a problem with literacy, but found the defendant capable of rational and logical discussion about the circumstances of the incident to be tried, was capable of assisting in the defense, and understood the nature and object of the legal proceedings. The trial court also did not err by refusing the defendant's requested jury charges as the charges either did not relate to the evidence or the charge given was all that was necessary. Velazquez v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 871</cite>, <cite class="app_court">655 S.E.2d 806</cite> (2008).

       <p>
        <p>
       - While answer that is responsive to question on cross-examination will not be ruled out although it would otherwise have been inadmissible as evidence, testimony that is inadmissible, which is given on cross-examination but is not responsive to question, should be ruled out; and it is error to overrule the motion to exclude it.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because evidence of defendant's gang membership was admissible both as part of the res gestae of the crime and to show motive, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motions in limine and for a new trial, even though the evidence implicated defendant's character. Garibay v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">275 Ga. App. 170</cite>, <cite class="app_court">620 S.E.2d 424</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial after an investigating officer testified on
   cross-
   examination that the defendant gave the officer a statement right after the defendant had talked with the defendant's parole officer because the testimony followed defense counsel's question regarding the content, not the timing, of the defendant's statement; a passing reference to a defendant's record does not place his or her character in evidence, and a nonresponsive answer that impacts negatively on a defendant's character does not improperly place his or her character in issue. Lanier v. State, <cite class="ga_court">288 Ga. 109</cite>, <cite class="app_court">702 S.E.2d 141</cite> (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial, challenging the admission of similar transaction evidence, because the similar transaction evidence properly corroborated the identity, intent, and course of conduct defendant engaged in with regard to two other home invasions with several other perpetrators that also included the rape of a victim. Grier v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 59</cite>, <cite class="app_court">658 S.E.2d 827</cite> (2008).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial, which was based on the admission of a recorded telephone conversation between the defendant and defendant's mother, who stated "because it's on your record," in response to why the defendant could not be disappointed if the defendant was denied bond; the comment was fleeting and was not a direct comment about the defendant's criminal history, and the mother did not comment on the content of the defendant's criminal record or even say, with certainty, that one did or did not exist.

       - Because a prosecutor's comments were directed at defense counsel's failure to rebut or explain the state's evidence and the prosecutor made a permissible analogy, there was no prosecutorial misconduct; consequently, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial. Duffy v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">271 Ga. App. 668</cite>, <cite class="app_court">610 S.E.2d 620</cite> (2005).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by declining to declare a mistrial when a coindictee testified that the coindictee had taken a polygraph examination because the trial court's prompt curative instructions to the jury to disregard the coindictee's statement was sufficient to prevent the testimony from having any prejudicial impact; it was highly improbable that the coindictee's remarks influenced the outcome of the case, in view of the strong weight of the evidence against the defendant.

       - Trial court did not err by admitting the defendant's custodial statement to a police detective because after the defendant invoked the right to counsel, the detective ceased the interrogation and was returning the defendant to jail when the defendant told the detective that the defendant would tell the detective what the detective wanted to know and then gave an incriminating statement upon returning to the room where the interrogation was conducted.

       - Trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the court committed harmful error when the court prevented the defendant from playing to the jury an unredacted recording of a phone conversation between a witness and a friend; the witness was essentially acting as an informant, or at least an agent of police investigators, at the time of the phone conversation, and thus, the witness's recorded statements were admissible as original evidence pursuant to former O.C.G.A.

       Trial court did not err by denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial after the jurors watched a portion of the defendant's videotaped statement, which the jurors were not supposed to view, because the jurors clearly indicated that the jurors could and would follow the trial court's curative instruction.

       - Objection may not be waived as to introduction of evidence on same subject matter through cross-examination or otherwise; nevertheless, a new trial will not be granted for harmless error in the admission of evidence.

       While it was error for a trial court to rule that a prior inconsistent statement needed to be authenticated before statement could be used for impeachment, that error was harmless due to the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt; defendant was properly denied a new trial on defendant's conviction for aggravated child molestation. Also, while it was error to exclude a prior inconsistent statement by another witness, the fact that the defendant was able to vigorously examine the witness on the statement and the fact that the contents of the statement were made known to the jury rendered that error harmless. Robinson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">265 Ga. App. 481</cite>, <cite class="app_court">594 S.E.2d 696</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the trial court erred by denying the defendant's motion in limine, by overruling defendant's objection on hearsay grounds, and by overruling defense counsel's objections to the prosecution's improper character evidence, it was highly probable that the errors did not contribute to the judgment convicting the defendant of trafficking in cocaine; therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial.

       Trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial on the ground that an eyewitness's testimony was based on hearsay because to the extent the testimony exposed prior difficulties between the codefendants and the victim, it was cumulative of other testimony that the defendant and the codefendant threatened the victim the day before the shooting; the other evidence implicating the defendant in the shooting made it highly probable that the hearsay testimony did not contribute to the verdict.

       - It is not reversible error to admit evidence that is merely irrelevant and immaterial. Mickle v. Moore, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 444</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 217</cite> (1939); McDaniel v.

       Admission of irrelevant testimony will not furnish ground for new trial unless the admission injuriously affected the party making the complaint. Turbaville v. State, <cite class="ga_court">58 Ga. 545</cite> (1877).
       </p>

       Admission of immaterial evidence without harmful effect is not a good ground for new trial. Cherry v. McCutchen, <cite class="ga_app_court">68 Ga. App. 682</cite>, <cite class="app_court">23 S.E.2d 587</cite> (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Rejection of testimony, admissible or inadmissible, which has no probative value whatever, or admitting legal testimony which is wholly immaterial, is not sufficient cause for granting a new trial. Because testimony has been inadvertently admitted, which is wholly immaterial, and which it is apparent could have helped neither party, a new trial will hardly be awarded in an important case.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Ordinarily, when illegal testimony is placed in evidence, it is not an abuse of discretion to refuse to grant a mistrial if sufficient corrective instructions are given in ruling out the testimony. This is true even if the illegal testimony has the effect of placing the defendant's character in issue, especially when the testimony is volunteered by the witness and not directly elicited by the solicitor.

        <p>
       - When certain evidence is admitted over objection, but similar evidence to the same effect is admitted without objection, admission of evidence objected to will not constitute reversible error, even if admission of evidence was erroneous. Louisville &amp; N.R.R. v. McCamy, <cite class="ga_app_court">72 Ga. App. 769</cite>, <cite class="app_court">35 S.E.2d 206</cite> (1945).

        <p>
       Testimony, even though illegally admitted over proper objection, will not constitute reversible error when substantially the same testimony is later introduced without objection. Johnson v.

        <p>
       When jury considers evidence on same subject matter, admitted without objection, it is not harmful error to allow the same evidence again admitted, over objections, since the admission would probably not change the result.

       <p>
        <p>
       - As a general rule, error in admitting illegal evidence is cured by subsequently ruling the evidence out. This rule, however, is subject to exception; for when illegal evidence may have worked such harm or injury to accused as to render it probable that the subsequent withdrawal of the evidence will not heal the injury inflicted by the improper admission, error is sufficient ground for grant of a new trial.

       - When it cannot be said that erroneously admitted evidence was not calculated to harm the defendant and prejudice the defendant's cause, the admission is ground for new trial. Brown v.

       - Although the defendant contended that along with the revocation of defendant's codefendant's plea deal after the codefendant made statements in contradiction of the plea hearing testimony and defendant's assertion that the defendant refused to give false testimony to the prosecutor in exchange for a plea deal, proved that the prosecutor knowingly allowed false evidence to be presented to the jury in violation of due process, the trial court did not err when the court did not credit the motion for new trial testimony; since the defendant's codefendant was not privy to what occurred in the house after the codefendant ran out and the defendant did not present any evidence at trial that the defendant's codefendant's testimony was false, the revocation of the codefendant's plea deal was inapposite as was defendant's rejection of the plea deal offer. Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding there was no misconduct warranting a new trial pursuant to O.C.G.A.

Thus, there was no error in the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for a new trial based upon a Brady violation. Freeman v. State, <cite class="ga_court">284 Ga. 830</cite>, <cite class="app_court">672 S.E.2d 644</cite> (2009).

       - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial because a remedial charge, which repeatedly admonished the jury that an accomplice's guilty plea was not to be considered in any way with respect to the defendant's guilt, was sufficient to remedy the error of the admission of the plea and render a mistrial unnecessary.

State, <cite class="ga_court">23 Ga. 57</cite> (1857); Evans v. State, <cite class="ga_court">33 Ga. 1</cite> (1861).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When no objection is made to illegal evidence on trial of case the admission is not ground for a new trial. Weldon v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga. App. 530</cite>, <cite class="app_court">51 S.E.2d 605</cite> (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When evidence is illegally admitted, a new trial may be granted, yet the general rule is that a specific ground of objection must be made at the time the evidence is offered. Boggs v. Griffeth Bros. Tire Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 304</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E.2d 915</cite> (1972).

       <p>
        <p>

        Failure to make objection to admission of illegal evidence
       
       will be treated as a waiver and will prevent court, on motion for new trial from inquiring as to competency of such evidence. Andrews v. State, <cite class="ga_court">118 Ga. 1</cite>, <cite class="app_court">43 S.E. 852</cite> (1903); Richardson v.

       Defendant's claim that defendant's character was improperly placed into evidence when an officer testified that the officer found defendant's prison identification card in defendant's pocket was waived as defendant failed to make a further objection or renew defendant's motion for a mistrial after a curative instruction was given. McCullough v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">268 Ga. App. 445</cite>, <cite class="app_court">602 S.E.2d 181</cite> (2004).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When objection to evidence does not state ground upon which the objection is based, error cannot be assigned upon overruling thereof; the ground must be specific, and must point out wherein and how admission of evidence would violate some recognized rule of the law of evidence. Cooksey v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">149 Ga. App. 572</cite>, <cite class="app_court">254 S.E.2d 892</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In order to raise on appeal contentions concerning admissibility of evidence the specific ground of objection must be made at the time the evidence is offered, and a failure to do so will be considered as a waiver. All evidence is admitted as a matter of course unless a valid ground of objection is interposed. Eiberger v. West, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga.

       - Objection to admission of evidence upon ground merely that the evidence is inadmissible is equivalent to assigning no reason at all for the evidence's exclusion. McDonald v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">21 Ga. App. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E. 262</cite> (1917).

        <p>
       - When trial judge promises that certain testimony which counsel for accused moves to exclude, on ground that the testimony does not connect the accused with the crime for which the accused is being tried, will be excluded unless such connection is shown, failure to make any subsequent motion to exclude the testimony can be treated by the court as a waiver of the objection, and failure to exclude the testimony is not cause for a new trial.

        <p>
       - After verdict it is too late for party who upon trial made no objection to testimony which was inadmissible or of no probative value, to urge for first time, as reason why new trial should be granted that party, failure of the judge to exclude such testimony upon motion of opposite party. That party's failure to object upon the party's own part, or to join in objection of the party's opponent will be construed as a waiver of all objection to it, and as a tacit admission that the party considered the testimony beneficial to that party's cause. Wright v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">6 Ga. App. 770</cite>, <cite class="app_court">65 S.E. 806</cite> (1909).

       - In order for court to grant new trial because of alleged error in introduction of evidence, upon direct exception to this court, it is incumbent upon plaintiff in error to show affirmatively in bill of exceptions, that the plaintiff was harmed and prejudiced by such ruling; and when there is no brief of evidence before this court, and it is not made to appear from bill of exceptions but that there was other evidence before the jury upon same subject, the plaintiff in error fails to show error requiring grant of a new trial in erroneous introduction of such evidence.

       Complaint in ground of motion for new trial of ruling admitting or excluding as evidence a paper, which does not set forth the paper literally or in substance in the ground itself or as an exhibit thereto properly identified, is insufficient to present any question for decision by the Supreme Court on a bill of exceptions assigning error on a judgment refusing a new trial.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - To obtain a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, a movant must satisfy the court: (1) that the evidence has come to the movant's knowledge since the trial; (2) that it was not owing to the want of due diligence that the movant did not acquire the evidence sooner; (3) that the evidence is so material that it would probably produce a different verdict; (4) that the evidence is not cumulative only; (5) that the affidavit of the witness is attached to the motion or the affidavit's absence accounted for; and (6) that the new evidence does not operate solely to impeach the credibility of a witness. All six requirements must be satisfied before a new trial will be granted. Young v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">194 Ga. App. 335</cite>, <cite class="app_court">390 S.E.2d 305</cite> (1990); Eliopulos v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">203 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Requirements for grant of new trial based on newly discovered evidence are: (1) that evidence has come to knowledge of moving party since trial; (2) that it was not owing to want of due diligence that moving party did not acquire the evidence sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would probably produce a different verdict; and (4) that it is not cumulative only. Turner v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">139 Ga. App. 503</cite>, <cite class="app_court">229 S.E.2d 23</cite> (1976); Jefferson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       It is incumbent on party who asks for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence to satisfy court: (1) that evidence has come to the party's knowledge since trial; (2) that it was not owing to want of due diligence that the party did not acquire it sooner; (3) that the evidence is so material that it would probably produce a different verdict; (4) that the evidence is not cumulative only; (5) that affidavit of witness should be procured or the affidavit's absence accounted for; and (6) that new trial will not be granted if only effect of evidence will be to impeach credit of witness. Benefield v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">140 Ga. App. 727</cite>, <cite class="app_court">232 S.E.2d 89</cite> (1976); Timberlake v. State, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 488</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 792</cite> (1980); Allanson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga.

       In motion for new trial made upon alleged newly discovered evidence, when it appears that latter is purely cumulative, and it does not appear that with additional evidence a verdict different from that already rendered would probably result, and when it further appears that the defendant and defense counsel could, by exercise of slightest diligence, have discovered such evidence before or at time of trial, this court will not hold that trial judge abused the judge's discretion in overruling motion. Stargel v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 74</cite>, <cite class="app_court">182 S.E. 406</cite> (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       To obtain a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, the evidence supporting the motion must be admissible, and must also satisfy six criteria: (1) it must have been discovered after the trial or hearing; (2) its late discovery was not due to lack of diligence; (3) it is so material that its introduction in evidence would probably produce a different result; (4) it is not cumulative only; (5) the affidavit of the witness must be attached to the motion (or its absence accounted for); and (6) it does not operate only to impeach a witness. Collins v. Kiah, <cite class="ga_app_court">218 Ga. App. 484</cite>, <cite class="app_court">462 S.E.2d 158</cite> (1995).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Although a codefendant who testified against the defendant at defendant's criminal trial indicated that a certain sentence was recommended by the prosecutor's office, and thereafter, a much more lenient sentence was actually imposed on that codefendant, the defendant failed to show that the state committed a Brady violation by not disclosing the more favorable deal that the state made with the testifying codefendant as the prosecutor testified that the codefendant had testified accurately as to the sentence recommendation, but that the sheriff's office had sought a more lenient sentence for the defendant, which was in fact imposed; accordingly, the defendant's new trial motion was properly denied and the convictions were properly affirmed.

       - When defendant's trial counsel did not move to sever defendant's two aggravated assault charges, which were similar in fact pattern and would have presumably been admitted in the trial of the other, it was found that severance was not mandatory and the defendant did not show prejudice as a result of the decision to not so move. The trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to seek severance of the charges.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Generally, granting of new trials on newly discovered evidence is not favored, because it tends to discourage diligence and encourage lack of diligence by litigants and their counsel on the first trial, causes delay in administering of justice, and loss of time, labor, and expense of another trial. Turner v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E. 626</cite> (1931).

      <p>
       <p>

       Extraordinary motions or cases contemplated by section
      
      are such as do not ordinarily occur in transaction of human affairs, as when a man has been convicted of murder, and it afterwards appears that supposed deceased is still alive, or when one is convicted on testimony of witness who is subsequently found guilty of perjury in giving that testimony, or when there has been some providential cause, and cases of like character.

       - Extraordinary motions for new trials, based solely upon ground of newly discovered evidence, are viewed by courts with even less favor than original motions based on such ground, a stricter rule being applied to the former. Norman v. Goode, <cite class="ga_court">121 Ga. 449</cite>, <cite class="app_court">49 S.E. 268</cite> (1904); Jackson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Extraordinary motion for new trial cannot be based upon evidence which was known to the movant or which could have been discovered in time by proper diligence. Hamilton v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 196</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E.2d 735</cite> (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Denial of defendant's extraordinary motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was upheld after the defendant failed to show, inter alia, that the allegedly new evidence came to the defendant's knowledge after trial or that the delay in acquiring the evidence was not the result of lack of due diligence. Alexander v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">264 Ga. App. 34</cite>, <cite class="app_court">589 S.E.2d 857</cite> (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Denial of defendant's motion for a new trial after the defendant's conviction for burglary and theft by receiving was not error, as defendant's alleged newly-discovered evidence would have been known prior to trial; the defendant knew of a witness' immediate presence during a conversation regarding stolen goods and, therefore, would have known prior to trial that the witness could have testified to the conversation. Fetter v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">271 Ga. App. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">610 S.E.2d 615</cite> (2005).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When accused has been convicted, a new trial denied the accused, and that judgment affirmed, in order for extraordinary motion for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence to be a valid motion, it must appear that newly discovered evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, and that newly discovered evidence would likely produce a different result. As none of these requirements can be determined without an examination of evidence adduced upon original trial of case, an extraordinary motion for new trial that does not contain a certified copy of evidence adduced upon original trial is not a good motion and can be denied upon this ground alone. Fields v. State, <cite class="ga_court">212 Ga. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">94 S.E.2d 694</cite> (1956).

        <p>
       - Petitioner, a death row inmate, argued in the petitioner's federal habeas petition as a separate claim for relief that the petitioner was actually innocent, but that claim failed because actual innocence was not itself a constitutional claim, and was instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner had to pass to have an otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits; further, the claim was not properly before the federal court, as the petitioner could pursue a claim of actual innocence in state court by filing an extraordinary motion for new trial under O.C.G.A.

       - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs' extraordinary motion for new trial based on an auto company's misleading discovery responses with regard to liability insurance because they acted with due diligence to raise their claim that the jury should have been qualified as to the auto company's insurers and the failure to do so raised an unrebutted presumption that they were materially harmed.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      When a defendant was knowledgeable as to the identity of an eyewitness, yet did not exercise due diligence to locate the witness, no subpoena was issued for this witness to appear at the trial, and there was no attempt made to obtain a continuance of the case so that this witness could be located, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for new trial.

       - When a bank deposed a customer, who had filed a slip and fall action against the bank, four years before trial and when asked whether the customer had any relatives who might become jurors, the customer indicated that a spouse had some but the customer did not know their names, it was held that the bank was on notice that further investigation was required in order to avoid the issue of juror disqualification pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       <p>
      When ground of motion for new trial, based on newly discovered evidence, is predicated on certified copies of various documents, and contains much that would not be admissible in event of another trial, it is proper for the trial judge and for the reviewing court, in passing upon the ground, to consider only such portions of alleged newly discovered evidence as would be admissible in the event of a new trial.

        Affidavit submitted by litigant's counsel purporting to show newly discovered evidence

      Coconspirator's testimony was not newly discovered evidence which warranted a new trial, as such, in addition to lacking credibility, was cumulative of the exculpatory evidence which was presented at trial, and impeached the inculpatory testimony of the coconspirator who was a witness for the prosecution.

      Defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence that the victim and similar transaction witness fabricated their allegations was properly denied as: (1) the evidence failed to show that a material witness's trial testimony was physically impossible; and (2) the evidence merely served to impeach the victim's and the similar transaction witness's trial testimony.

      Trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence with regard to defendant's conviction for making an untrue material statement of fact and omitting other material facts in selling stock to a victim as the four affidavits in support of the defendant's motion set forth that, contrary to the victim's testimony on direct examination, the defendant had disclosed various legal difficulties to the victim, including the defendant's disbarment from the practice of law; the affidavits served only the purpose of impeachment, thus failing to satisfy the final requirement of case law that a new trial will not be granted if the only effect of the evidence will be to impeach the credit of a witness.

       - Cumulative evidence is evidence tending to establish a fact in relation to which there was evidence upon trial. Walker v. State, <cite class="ga_court">126 Ga. 588</cite>, <cite class="app_court">55 S.E. 483</cite> (1906); Lawhorn v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Evidence is cumulative when the evidence goes to the fact principally controverted upon trial, and respecting which the party asking for a new trial produced testimony. Greenway v. Sloan, <cite class="ga_court">211 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E.2d 366</cite> (1955); Fields v.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - It is only when newly discovered evidence either relates to particular material issue concerning which no witness has previously testified, or is of a higher and different grade from that previously had on same material point, that it will ordinarily be taken outside definition of cumulative evidence, and afford a basis for a new trial. Johnson v. State, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 806</cite>, <cite class="app_court">27 S.E.2d 749</cite> (1943).

        That newly discovered evidence incidentally strengthens defense used in trial does not make the evidence cumulative,

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial as the hearsay evidence of alleged post-trial statements that the victim and the victim's mother made to the relatives of the defendant, who had been convicted of two counts of child molestation regarding the victim, that the victim and the mother had admitted that they lied at trial about the molestation, only had the effect of impeaching the trial testimony of prosecution witnesses and a new trial would not be granted under such circumstances.

       Failure by the defendant to comply with former Ga. Ct.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c05s5-5-23" target="_self">5-5-23</a></cite> because the results of any polygraph test given to the victim would not have done more than impeach the victim's credibility and there was no showing by the defendant that the evidence would not have merely been cumulative.

       Effect of showing that efforts were made to get certain persons to testify falsely against the defendant, which persons did not testify at all, could only be material as a circumstance to show that same effort was made to get those who did testify against the defendant to likewise swear falsely.

       Defendant's aggravated stalking conviction was upheld on appeal, and a new trial was properly denied, as sufficient evidence of the defendant's contact with the victim, in violation of a protective order, and acts of harassment and intimidation supported the conviction; moreover, the failure to object to the state's of similar transaction evidence waived any consideration of the evidence on appeal.

       Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence with regard to the defendant's conviction for the murder of the defendant's mother as the purported newly discovered evidence that another man with whom the defendant had used cocaine with on the day of the murder killed the defendant's mother after learning that the mother had a large sum of cash in the home in preparation for a trip, was part of the defendant's defense, and was vigorously advanced at trial; the reviewing court found no error after concluding that the newly discovered evidence would not have reasonably produced a different result.

       Trial court properly denied defendants' motions to suppress and for new trial with regard to the defendants' convictions for drug possession and trafficking based on obtaining allegedly new evidence that a stopping officer failed to run a computer check of one defendant's driver's license, as that officer had indicated, because there was no showing that defendants exercised due diligence in obtaining the additional evidence. In fact, the reason defense counsel provided for not obtaining the evidence sooner was a failure to believe that the computer check of the license was going to be a key issue. Woodard v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">658 S.E.2d 129</cite> (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1061, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 475 (Ga. 2008).

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence where bystander's existence was known by defense prior to trial; moreover, as the bystander's claim that defendant had no gun was contradicted by three bystanders and a victim, it did not appear that evidence would have produced a different verdict. Banks v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 887</cite>, <cite class="app_court">660 S.E.2d 873</cite> (2008).

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence because the defendant failed to establish that the new evidence attacked the creditability of a witness; credibility is attacked by showing that the pending charges and their dismissal reveal a possible bias, prejudice, or ulterior motive on behalf of the witness to give untruthful or shaded testimony in an effort to please the state and not merely to testify in accordance with the state's theory of the case. Delgiudice v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">308 Ga. App. 397</cite>, <cite class="app_court">707 S.E.2d 603</cite> (2011).

       <p>
        <p>
       Decision denying the defendant's motion for a new trial was proper, in light of the strength of the evidence that the defendant committed the charged offenses, including fingerprint evidence; it could not be concluded that new DNA evidence excluding the defendant as the donor of a semen sample recovered from a victim was so material that the DNA evidence warranted a new trial. Wright v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">310 Ga. App. 80</cite>, <cite class="app_court">712 S.E.2d 105</cite> (2011).

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's extraordinary motion for a new trial as the defendant could have moved to conduct DNA testing prior to trial and would have discovered that DNA on the gloves did not match the defendant, but rather the codefendant, and the defendant was thus unable to show that the delay in obtaining evidence was not caused by a lack of due diligence as required in an extraordinary motion for new trial.

       - Upon hearing of motion for new trial, based upon newly discovered evidence, when affidavits are introduced supporting and disputing ground of motion, the trial judge is trier of facts, and it is the judge's province to determine credibility of conflicting facts and contradictory witnesses.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Under motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, trial court and appellate court are necessarily required to consider alleged newly discovered evidence in light of and in comparison with evidence adduced at trial, and on which conviction is based, in order that court may determine whether alleged newly discovered evidence is merely cumulative or impeaching. Accordingly, injury is done to the defendant in appeal to allow introduction of evidence adduced at trial. Herrin v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga.

       - Fact that verdict was authorized by evidence adduced at trial in no way precludes probability of different verdict on another trial with newly discovered evidence, when evidence merely authorized, but did not demand, verdict, and such verdict was before vital, newly discovered evidence supplying missing link was before jury.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Under motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, when evidence consists of conflicting oaths, presumption in favor of verdict is sufficient to sustain exercise of discretion by judge in upholding verdict. Herrin v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">71 Ga. App. 384</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E.2d 124</cite> (1944).

        When countershowing is made on application under section,
       
       trial judge becomes trier of issue thus formed and the judge's discretion is final and cannot be controlled by the appellate court unless there is a manifest abuse of the discretion. Herrin v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence in a criminal trial, when there is a countershowing by the state, the judge is the trier of facts, and it is the judge's province to determine credibility of facts and contradictory witnesses, and the judge's discretion in refusing a new trial on alleged newly discovered evidence will not be controlled unless manifestly abused. Bailey v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga. App. 856</cite>, <cite class="app_court">171 S.E. 874</cite> (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When motion for new trial is based on ground of newly discovered evidence, and there is a countershowing, with conflicting evidence as to truth of alleged newly discovered facts, the Supreme Court will not interfere with grant or refusal of new trial on that ground, unless there has been a manifest abuse of discretion which law has vested in the trial judge, but not conferred on the Supreme Court. Southwell v. State, <cite class="ga_court">188 Ga. 310</cite>, <cite class="app_court">4 S.E.2d 26</cite> (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial judge does not abuse the judge's discretion in refusing new trial when alleged newly discovered evidence is contradicted in countershowing. Atlanta Consol. S. Ry. v.

       - In motion for new trial upon ground of newly discovered evidence, when state made countershowing with a later affidavit of witness who proposed to testify in behalf of the defendant, which showed that the proposed witness largely repudiated the witness's first affidavit, rendering it doubtful or equivocal as to what the witness would testify, the judge did not err in overruling motion.

       - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial when the state did not stipulate during the sentencing phase of trial that the shotgun found in the defendant's possession was improperly measured.

        <p>
       - Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial as the trial court's finding that defendant's jurors were not present when the codefendant pleaded guilty was not clearly erroneous since the victims testified that: (1) the victims were present in the courtroom during the codefendant's guilty plea; (2) the victims were familiar with and would have recognized the jurors selected to hear the defendant's case; and (3) no jurors selected to hear the defendant's case were present in the courtroom during the codefendant's guilty plea.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court erred by refusing to conduct a hearing or to rule on the defendant's motion for a new trial based upon the court's finding that the defendant was, at that time, mentally incompetent and unable to assist the counsel in challenging the conviction, as defendant's current mental incompetence provided no logical basis to delay a post-conviction proceeding to address whether the defendant was incompetent at trial, whether the trial court should have been on notice of the defendant's incompetency and conducted a hearing during trial, or whether the trial counsel was ineffective for failing to timely raise the competency issue. Florescu v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">276 Ga. App. 264</cite>, <cite class="app_court">623 S.E.2d 147</cite> (2005).

        Without a record of trial,
       
       the Court of Appeals was forced to be in accord with the presumption in favor of regularity of the trial court's denial of the motion, and assume that the court's findings were supported by sufficient competent evidence; thus, the findings made against the intervenor regarding the legitimation of a child he claimed to be the biological father of were upheld.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Subsection (b) is an adoption of Fed. R. Civ. P. 51, and thus federal cases provide guidance for resolving issues presented in the statute's interpretation. Daniels v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">137 Ga. App. 371</cite>, <cite class="app_court">224 S.E.2d 60</cite> (1976). But see Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 8</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Subsection (b) of this section is an adoption of Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 and decisions of federal courts are authoritative though not binding on the question of the statute's construction. Seaney &amp; Co. v. Katz, <cite class="ga_app_court">132 Ga. App. 456</cite>, <cite class="app_court">208 S.E.2d 333</cite> (1974). But see Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 8</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E.2d 417</cite> (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       As subsection (b) is similar to Fed. R. Civ. P. 51, federal courts' application has persuasive influence. Smith v. Poteet, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">195 S.E.2d 213</cite> (1972). But see Continental Cas. Co. v.

       - Trial judge in passing on motions for mistrial has a broad discretion, dependent on the circumstances of each case, which will not be disturbed unless manifestly abused. Furthermore, unless it is apparent that a mistrial is essential to preservation of the right of fair trial, the discretion of the trial judge will not be interfered with. Marriott Corp. v.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c05s5-5-24" target="_self">5-5-24</a></cite> requires such desired requests to be in writing in order to inform the court as to the jury instructions to be given and the statute, as amended, refers to all cases both civil and criminal.

       When a criminal defendant was tried on charges of kidnapping and murder, and after the court had recharged the jury three times on kidnapping, the defendant, for the first time, requested a charge on false imprisonment; the trial court did not err in failing to give the defendant's requested charge on false imprisonment; the request was not made at or before the close of the evidence, and the evidence did not authorize the charge.

       Trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on the Statute of Frauds because, while the defendant made an oral, non-specific request, the defendant did not offer a written charge adjusted to the facts of the case; the defendant did not include the defense of the Statute of Frauds in the pretrial order and did not move to modify that order; the defendant did not raise the defense of the Statute of Frauds simply by stating that the defendant intended to rely on all applicable statutes governing contracts and all applicable legal principles and rules of contract law, quasi-contracts, and equitable remedies and relief; and the defendant's promise to the plaintiffs was one of indemnity, which generally fell outside the Statute of Frauds.

        <p>
       - Requirement that copies of jury instruction requests be given to opposing counsel at the time the requests are submitted to court can serve no useful purpose other than to afford opposing counsel an opportunity to argue to the court, before granting or refusing of such request, counsel's contentions with respect to whether such requested charges should be given.

       - Unlike subsection (a), subsection (b) contains no provision relating to objections to refusals to grant requests to charge. This is because when party has presented to court written requests that it instruct jury on law as set forth therein, court normally affords such party at that time an opportunity to state grounds upon which he contends such submitted request to charge should be given.

       Refusal of request is not error when correct instruction by trial court dealing with principles of law embodied in request, although in more abstract terminology, is given. Johnson v.

        <p>
       If it can be determined that point at issue was presented to jury in substantially as clear and understandable a manner as that requested, keeping in mind that a jury is a lay audience, there should be no reversal when language conveys correctly the intent of the law and is so framed as to be applied with understanding to fact situation.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Simply because a request to charge is apt, correct, and pertinent, it is not necessarily error to fail to charge it, but test is whether court substantially covered principles embodied therein or whether it was sufficiently or substantially covered by general charge. Seaboard Coast Line R.R. v. Thomas, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga.

       It is no longer necessary to give exact language of requests to charge when same principles are fairly given to jury in general charge of court. Shirley v. State, <cite class="ga_court">245 Ga. 616</cite>, <cite class="app_court">266 S.E.2d 218</cite> (1980).

       Since the repeal and reenactment of this section by Ga. L. 1965, p. 18,
   §
   17, there is presently no requirement in this state that the court instruct the jury in the exact language of a request, even though the request may be correct as an abstract principle of law which is directly applicable to a material issue when the charge given by the court substantially covers the same principles.

       Trial court's alleged error in instructing the jury that the jury could consider the level of certainty shown by a witness about the witness's identification when addressing the reliability of identifications was waived since the defendant requested the instruction; because the defendant requested the instruction, substantial error review under O.C.G.A.

       - In the absence of a timely written request, the trial court does not err in failing to charge the jury that the defendant has a constitutional right not to testify and that no inference could be made as a result of the defendant's failure to testify on the defendant's own behalf.

       - While it would have been better had a trial court explicitly told a jury to decide the guilt or innocence of each codefendant separately, the court's instructions were not sufficiently prejudicial to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, especially since the defendant neither failed to request such an instruction nor made any objection to the trial court's charge.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial because it was within the trial court's discretion to decide whether a mistrial was the only corrective measure or whether any prejudicial effect of a jury instruction handout error could otherwise be corrected; the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in determining that any prejudicial effect could be adequately addressed by remedial instructions, together with a correct copy of the jury charge, such that a mistrial was not the only corrective measure that would preserve defendant's right to a fair trial, and the charge as a whole, including the remedial actions taken by the trial court, was not likely to confuse the jury.

       In plaintiff patient's medical malpractice suit against the defendants, a doctor and the doctor's professional corporation, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the patient's requested jury charge that a patient was entitled to believe and rely upon the affirmative representations of the patient's doctor, and that, while under the doctor's care, the patient had no duty to investigate or confirm the truth or accuracy of the doctor's representations, as: (1) the patient failed to show how the charge was relevant in relation to the disputed issue of whether the doctor was negligent in failing to refer the patient to a specialist; and (2) the charge was not required even if, as the patient contended, the patient's credibility was at issue, because the trial court adequately charged the jury on credibility.

        <p>
       - Although the condemnee contended that the trial court erred in failing to inform the jury that the jury could consider the right to cure as a part of consequential damages, the court was correct in explaining to trial counsel that evidence of damage to property as a result of a taking, as represented by a cost to cure, may be considered a factor in establishing the reduced fair market value of the remaining property after the taking although the cost to cure may not be recovered as a separate element of damage; although the trial court instructed the jury that the cost to cure may not be recovered as a separate element of damage, the court did not inform the jury that the cost to cure could be a factor in establishing the reduced fair market value of the remaining property after the taking. But the condemnee did not take advantage of the opportunity provided by the court to have the condemnee's expert clarify cost to cure for the jury, and the condemnee waived any claim of error because the condemnee made no objection following the court's instruction. Moreover, the appellate court found no substantial error in the court's instruction that was harmful as a matter of law in light of the court's charge to the jury at the end of trial concerning consequential damages.

        <p>
       - In a prosecution for aggravated assault, it was harmless error for the court not to charge that the defendant had knowledge that the persons assaulted were police officers when the defendant testified that the defendant knew they were police officers and that the defendant called<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.09.html#t09c01s9-1-1" target="_blank">9-1-1</a></cite> to summon the officers to the scene.

        <p>
       In a prosecution for aggravated assault upon a police officer, failing to charge the jury expressly that an essential element of the offense is the defendant's knowledge that the victim was a police officer was harmless error because the defendant's testimony showed clearly that the defendant knew the man was a police officer.

        <p>
       - Trial judge may, of the judge's own volition and in the judge's discretion, charge on a lesser crime of that included in indictment or accusation. However, the judge's failure to do so, without written request by state or accused, is not error. Bouttry v.

       - Trial court's instructing the jury on civil conspiracy was not harmful to the defendant as a matter of law because, to the extent that the plaintiff alleged that the defendant directly or indirectly through the defendant's doctors maliciously undertook actions aimed at destroying the plaintiff's medical practice, the plaintiff asserted a theory against the defendant that was cognizable regardless of the existence of a conspiracy.

       - Allen charge was not fatally defective because, although the Allen charge contained some inaccurate language, the fact that the jury spent less than an hour deliberating after the charge was given did not prove coercion; it was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant's motion for a new trial as it was just as likely that the jury reached a verdict quickly after the Allen charge due to a fresh perspective after a night away from deliberations.

        <p>
       - Appellate court was entitled to consider whether a substantial error in a jury charge was harmful as a matter of law, regardless of whether or not the defendant objected to the jury charge in the trial court. The trial court's failure to charge the jury on defendant's sole issue of self defense in the defendant's felony obstruction of an officer case involved substantial error that was harmful as a matter of law, even though the defendant did not object, as some evidence supported giving the instruction and the failure to give the instruction was the equivalent of directing a verdict against the defendant.

       - Errors alleged to have been in charge but to which there was no exception as provided in subsections (a) and (b) will not generally be held harmful as a matter of law, and will not be considered unless it appears that gross injustice is about to result or has resulted, directly attributable to alleged errors. Barlow v. Rushin, <cite class="ga_app_court">114 Ga. App. 304</cite>, <cite class="app_court">151 S.E.2d 199</cite> (1966); Murray v. Richardson, <cite class="ga_app_court">134 Ga.

       When appellant did not object to charge of trial court on measure of damages as required by this section and court did not commit substantial error in charge which was harmful as a matter of law, no question for review is presented by enumerations of error on those grounds.

       When appellant made no objection to trial court's charge, even when asked specifically by court if the appellant had any question or additions to the charge, unless there is substantial error which is harmful as a matter of law, such acquiescence in given instruction is reason enough to find appellant's enumeration of error regarding the charge to be without merit.

       - Defense counsel waives objections when counsel states, in response to the trial court's query, that counsel has no exceptions to a charge as given. Kirk v.

       When at the close of the trial court's charge, the defendant's trial counsel states counsel has no exceptions to the charge, this constitutes a waiver. Hunt v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the trial court specifically asked for exceptions to the charge and defense counsel neither objected nor reserved exceptions for post-conviction review, defendant's claims of error regarding the jury charge were thus waived.

        Failure to object to charge at time of trial

       When at trial, plaintiff fails to make objection on ground enumerated as error, such enumeration presents nothing for court's consideration. Moon v. Combs, <cite class="ga_app_court">116 Ga. App. 144</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E.2d 543</cite> (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When no objections were made to the failure to give requested charges, those objections cannot be considered on appeal. Nolen v. Murray Indus., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 785</cite>, <cite class="app_court">302 S.E.2d 689</cite> (1983).

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the plaintiff challenges the trial court's "failure" to "caution" the jury about improper language contained in an order, but no cautionary instructions were requested at the time the evidence was admitted, no exceptions were taken to the court's charge, and no requests for instructions on this issue were submitted by the plaintiff, in view of the plaintiff's failure to except to the charge or present to the court the charge requested, this enumeration is without merit. Eiberger v. West, <cite class="ga_app_court">165 Ga. App. 559</cite>, <cite class="app_court">301 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the appellant enumerates as error the failure of the trial court to give requested charges on a defense to a criminal count, but it appears that, although given the opportunity to do so in the trial court, the appellant neither raised any objection to the charge, nor reserved the right to except to the trial court's charge at a later time, counsel waives counsel's right to assert error. Bivins v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 580</cite>, <cite class="app_court">305 S.E.2d 29</cite> (1983).

       <p>
        <p>
       There is no difference between cases when counsel acquiesced in the giving of a charge and cases when counsel acquiesced in the failure to give a particular charge. If counsel expressly acquiesced in a jury charge as given, any objection to either the inclusion or the omission of a particular charge was waived. Bell v. Samaritano, <cite class="ga_app_court">196 Ga. App. 612</cite>, <cite class="app_court">396 S.E.2d 520</cite> (1990), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">260 Ga. 768</cite>, <cite class="app_court">400 S.E.2d 13</cite> (1991).

       In a personal injury action, when there was no objection to a charge respecting proximate cause on any occasion, any error was induced by the plaintiff, and precludes the plaintiff from maintaining the issue on appeal.

       - Although the defendant failed to object to the trial court's practice in the second phase of a bifurcated trial and failed to request that the trial court repeat the court's instructions on reasonable doubt, presumption of evidence, and other general principles of law that the trial court had charged at the end of the first phase of the trial, the trial court erred in failing to give those instructions, which protect a defendant's constitutional rights; however, the error was harmless as the jury received the trial court's full instructions after arguments in the first phase of the trial and then, only three hours later, the jury began deliberations in the second phase of the trial. McKenye v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">247 Ga. App. 536</cite>, <cite class="app_court">544 S.E.2d 490</cite> (2001), overruled on other grounds, Wallace v.

       - When a party failed to ask to reargue the facts in light of an instruction, any error attributable to the court's having surprised counsel with an instruction that counsel believed had been withdrawn was not preserved for appellate review; as counsel had excepted to the instruction on the record before the jury returned the jury's verdict, however, the appropriateness of the instruction itself had been preserved for review.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c05s5-5-24" target="_self">5-5-24</a></cite> does not relieve the criminal defendant of the obligation to make timely objection throughout the trial.

       Plaintiffs in a personal injury case had preserved plaintiffs' objection to a jury recharge for review when plaintiffs' counsel objected on the grounds that the recharge was confusing, misleading, and contrary to the law, and the plaintiffs were not required to submit an alternate charge; the plaintiffs' objection clearly identified the paragraph of the recharge to which the plaintiffs were excepting and specified that the recharge was being challenged because the recharge was contrary to Georgia law, and that was all the law required to preserve an objection for appeal.

       - When the trial court asked for objections to the jury charge, the defendant stated some objections but did not mention the portion of the charge to which the defendant objected on appeal, and did not reserve the right to object in a motion for new trial or an appeal, thereby waiving the defendant's right to assert error on appeal, the Court of Appeals reviewed the charge but found that the charge was not harmful as a matter of law.

       - Court's failure to define the term "proximate cause" did not result in such a gross injustice as to raise a question of whether the defendant was denied a fair trial as the case did not involve evidence of multiple, intervening, or superseding causes or other factors that can render proximate cause an elusive concept when the jury was presented with evidence that the defendant negligently caused the automobile collision and that the plaintiff sustained back injuries.

       In a fatal collision between a freight train and a pickup truck, because the plaintiffs did not object to the trial court's charge on the sudden emergency defense on the ground that the defense was preempted by federal law or on the ground that the charge as given was an incomplete statement of the law, the trial court was never afforded an opportunity to rule on the specific objections raised by the plaintiffs on appeal, and the plaintiffs' challenge to the charge on those grounds was waived for purposes of appellate review.

       Because an appellant readily admitted that the appellant failed to request charges on circumstantial evidence and speculative damages and did not object to the charge given by the trial court, the appeals court refused to hold that the trial court's failure to give the charges, sua sponte, created such a gross injustice as to deprive the appellant of a fair trial.

   The trial court's preliminary instruction properly informed the jury that under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI(a): (1) the jury was absolutely and exclusively the judge of the facts in the case; (2) the jury was, in this sense only, the judge of the law; (3) it was the province of the court to construe the law and give the law in the charge; and (4) it was the province of the jury to take the law as given, apply the law to the facts as found by the jury, and bring in a general verdict.

       Under subsection (c), the appellate court is empowered to review instructions which are substantially and harmfully erroneous as a matter of law, that is, error that is blatantly apparent and prejudicial to the extent that the error raises a question as to whether the losing party has to some extent at least been deprived of a fair trial because of the error.

       When, in a murder prosecution, the trial court erroneously charged the jury that the jury could infer the defendant's intent to kill the victim from the defendant's use of a deadly weapon, but the defendant did not object to this charge, the charge was not a "substantial error," within the meaning of O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - Under subsection (c), before the appellate court will reverse the trial court because of an erroneous instruction not excepted to in the trial court, it must appear that such charge was necessarily harmful to the complaining party. Any charge which is not necessarily harmful to the complaining party is not such substantial error as to require reversal of the case, in the absence of a proper exception to the charge. Moon v.

        Charge on theory of reasonable probable use in a condemnation proceeding

       - When the plaintiff's attorney specifically requests the court to instruct the jury that the plaintiff can recover above the $5,000 no-fault statute provisions, there is no substantial error requiring reversal in the court's referring to the Georgia no-fault insurance law during the course of the trial and in the court's charge to the jury.

        <p>
       - In a negligence case, after the trial court charged the jury that there was evidence, via a traffic citation, of a plea of guilty by the defendant, which could be considered as an admission, it would have been appropriate to charge that, if the jury concluded no guilty plea was entered, the jury should disregard the citation, but in the absence of any such request or objection to the citation's omission, there was no basis for reversal. The trial court gave the charge requested by the defendant, which informed the jury that evidence of the plea was not conclusive of the issues before the jury, and the court otherwise fully instructed the jury on the general principles of negligence. Under these circumstances the exception of subsection (c) of O.C.G.A.
   §

       - In an action to recover damages for fraud connected with the sale and purchase of a car, the trial court's erroneous recharge directing the jury that the car would be returned to the seller by operation of law was so blatantly in error as to raise the question whether the buyer was deprived of a fair trial; further, the error was an error of law and the error was prejudicial because the error went to the primary issue in the case, the value of the car, and nothing in the evidence supported the jury verdict and subsequent judgment returning the car to the seller.

        There was no substantial error in the jury charge
       
       as the friend who testified against the defendant had already been convicted of the crime at the time of the defendant's trial and there was no evidence of any deals with the state; defendant did not show that the allegedly erroneous charge was blatantly apparent and prejudicial to the extent that it raised a question whether defendant was deprived of a fair trial and thus waived objection to the charge.

       With regard to a defendant's conviction on child molestation charges, the trial court did not err by failing to give a limiting instruction, absent a request, prior to testimony of certain acts the defendant committed against the victim two years before the incidents for which the defendant was on trial; defendant's failure to request such a limiting instruction required the defendant to demonstrate that the allegedly erroneous charge was blatantly apparent and prejudicial to the extent that the charge raised a question whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial, however the defendant failed to make any such showing.

       When the defendant did not file a proposed charge on corporations being a separate legal entity and did not ask for one during the charge conference, because the court's charge to the jury on contract formation included the requirements of having parties with the capacity to contract who consent and agree to all terms of the contract, and the defendant argued to the jury that if there was a promise, it came from the real estate development company, not the defendant personally, there was nothing in the court's charge to the jury that would have prevented the jury from agreeing with the defendant and finding no personal liability; thus, there was no substantial error in the jury charge that was harmful as a matter of law.

       - Court of Appeals of Georgia could not consider the defendant's motion for a new trial as a viable procedural substitute for a motion in arrest of judgment. Kirkland v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">282 Ga. App. 331</cite>, <cite class="app_court">638 S.E.2d 784</cite> (2006).

       - The objection raised below was not sufficient to direct the trial court's attention to the claimed error and was not stated with sufficient particularity to leave no doubt about the portion of the charge challenged or what the specific ground of challenge was; therefore, the issue was not preserved on appeal. Anderson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">231 Ga. App. 807</cite>, <cite class="app_court">499 S.E.2d 717</cite> (1998).

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a mistrial because the defendant requested a curative instruction after the motion for a mistrial was denied, and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard a witness's comment, and since defense counsel did not renew the mistrial motion thereafter, the defendant could not complain of the failure to grant the motion. Reese v. State, <cite class="ga_court">289 Ga. 446</cite>, <cite class="app_court">711 S.E.2d 717</cite> (2011).

        Generally, new trial is granted only as to matters foreign to record,

       - Before a verdict becomes final the verdict should, when the losing party requires by motion for new trial, receive approval of the mind and conscience of trial judge.

       - Law permits trial judge to refuse or grant new trials, in exercise of legal discretion, but it does not give appellate court any discretion in the matter; it can only grant new trials when errors of law have been committed, or when trial judge has abused the judge's discretion in refusing new trial.

       - When there is nothing in an order overruling a motion for new trial to indicate that the judge was dissatisfied with the verdict on discretionary grounds, but on the contrary, in overruling the motion on all grounds and refusing a new trial on all of them indicated the judge's approval, the appellate court will not say the judge abused the judge's discretion, since the trial judge is presumed to have known the judge's obligation was to exercise legal discretion and that in overruling motion is presumed to have exercised this discretion.

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by denying the defendant's motion for mistrial because a juror's improper behavior was brought to the trial court's attention immediately after the behavior occurred, and upon learning of the improper behavior, the trial court examined the offending juror without delay and subsequently dismissed the juror from the jury; the remaining jurors were then examined and indicated by their response to the trial court's question that the jurors had not overheard any comments on the case by the offending juror, and thus, even though the alleged improper comment involved the ultimate issue in the case, the record reflected no evidence that the jury was tainted or that the defendant was harmed by the juror's misconduct.

       Court of appeals rejected the defendant's contention on appeal that the trial court prevented the defendant to fully develop an ineffective assistance of counsel claim at the hearing on a motion for a new trial, as the record was replete with evidence that the defendant was given a great deal of latitude and ample opportunity to develop the issue. Brown v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 453</cite>, <cite class="app_court">646 S.E.2d 289</cite> (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1503, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 672 (Ga. 2007).

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial after the defendant was convicted of statutory rape because the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel; the trial court's determination that the defendant's trial counsel articulated a reasonable defense strategy was not clearly erroneous because counsel made a strategic decision that a specific line of investigation was unnecessary since the expected finding from the investigation would not have been helpful to the defense employed, and at trial, counsel presented evidence consistent with the defense strategy.

       - Because the defendant presented sufficient evidence to show that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to stipulate to the defendant's felon status or to obtain a jury charge limiting the jury's consideration of the defendant's criminal history, such failures prejudiced the defendant's defense sufficiently to require a new trial on a charge of aggravated assault; however, given the defendant's admission to possessing a gun at the time of the altercation, no prejudice resulted to warrant reversal and a new trial on the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon conviction.

       - Misconduct, mistake, surprise, and prejudice, and other grounds of failure, are provided against by expedience of new trial. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Harden, <cite class="ga_court">113 Ga. 453</cite>, <cite class="app_court">38 S.E. 949</cite> (1901).

       - Because there was some evidence supporting the jury's verdict in favor of homeowners in the homeowners' class action against a private water system owner, the trial court did not err in denying the owner's motion for new trial and the owner's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on general grounds, and since the case involved disputed factual issues, the trial court properly allowed the jury to resolve those issues. Although the owner argued that the jury did not interpret the facts as the owner believes the jury should have, that argument presented no grounds that would allow the court of appeals to find error by the trial court in refusing to overturn the jury's verdict. Jones v. Forest Lake Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="ga_app_court">304 Ga. App. 495</cite>, <cite class="app_court">696 S.E.2d 453</cite> (2010).

       - When counsel's absence is due to unintentional statement of solicitor (now district attorney) and accused is forced to trial with advice only of attorney then and there appointed by court, new trial will be granted.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Defense counsel's introduction of certified copies of convictions of state's witnesses to impeach the witnesses, without redacting the portion that implicated defendant as a participant in those crimes, which were identical or incidental to the crimes for which the defendant was on trial, was deficient performance by counsel as the main evidence against the defendant was the testimony from those witnesses and there was no physical evidence that linked the defendant to the crimes, the fact that the defendant was involved with those same defendants in prior similar crimes could have led the jury to conclude that the same pattern was being repeated, and there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's ineffective assistance, the outcome of the trial would have been different, such that the defendant was entitled to a new trial pursuant to O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       Trial court committed reversible error when the court did not address a defendant's claim that defense counsel failed to support post-conviction remedies, deliberately foregoing a direct appeal for four years without the defendant's consent, because that ground was closely connected to the defendant's repeated effort to obtain appellate counsel and, as such, a hearing was required; moreover, the defendant was entitled to rely on the fact that a hearing on the motion was scheduled, and as a result, no action was taken to waive or abandon a right to a hearing. Jones v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">280 Ga. App. 287</cite>, <cite class="app_court">633 S.E.2d 806</cite> (2006).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c07s5-7-1ol1a7" target="_self">5-7-1(a)(7)</a></cite>, as amended in 2005, the appeals court found that the defendant was properly granted a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel, given counsel's failure to interview any of the state's witnesses, present a viable defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter, and adequately investigate whether the victim's death might have been an accident. State v. McMillon, <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 671</cite>, <cite class="app_court">642 S.E.2d 343</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because: (1) the defendant raised a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a motion for a new trial based on counsel's failure to locate and present evidence of specific acts of violence by the alleged victim against third persons; (2) trial counsel's statement as to unsuccessfully attempting to locate these witnesses did not negate the possibility that a failure to do so constituted deficient performance; and (3) the defendant raised the ineffective assistance claim at the earliest practicable opportunity, albeit on appeal, the defendant asserted a colorable claim of ineffective assistance that required an evidentiary hearing on remand for the claim's resolution. Portilla v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 401</cite>, <cite class="app_court">646 S.E.2d 277</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in granting the defendant a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel as: (1) counsel's pretrial investigation was deficient; (2) counsel made no effort to investigate or to obtain the criminal records of the state's similar transaction witness before trial, and did not ask for more time or a continuance upon learning that the defendant did not have the records; (3) the defendant pointed out that the jury had doubts about the victim's testimony based on their verdict of guilt to sexual battery, as a lesser-included offense of child molestation, the crime the defendant was charged with committing; (4) there was evidence that the victim had reason to lie; (5) the charged incident was not reported until after the defendant's wife hired a divorce lawyer, who then arranged the first interview between the victim and investigators; and (6) given that the evidence against the defendant was not overwhelming, this impeachment evidence was particularly crucial. State v. Lamb, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 389</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 504</cite> (2007), overruled on other grounds, O'Neal v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant's claim as to the pre-trial ineffective assistance of appointed counsel could not be resolved by the record on appeal, the denial of a new trial as to that claim was reversed, and the case was remanded for a hearing on that claim only. Robinson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">288 Ga. App. 219</cite>, <cite class="app_court">653 S.E.2d 810</cite> (2007).

       </p>
       <p>

       Trial court erred by denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to move for a directed verdict as to a count of the indictment alleging that the defendant operated a motor vehicle as a habitual violator without a valid driver's license because the state failed to prove the charge alleged in that count; because the trial court would have been required to grant a motion for directed verdict, trial counsel was ineffective by failing to make such a motion.

       <p>

       - Because the defendant had a right to be present in the courtroom during voir dire of the jury, regarding some suspicious telephone calls that some had been receiving, in order to assist trial counsel in effectively examining the jurors regarding the jurors' abilities to be fair and impartial, and the defendant did not waive that right, the trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial.

       Defendants were improperly denied the right to open and close final argument where defense counsel used a police officer's report to cast doubt on the officer's recollection and credibility, and did not read the police and child services agencies' reports into evidence when attempting to implicate other family members; while the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions, the evidence was not overwhelming, so the error was not harmless and defendants were entitled to a new trial.

       - When it appears that the juror is related within a prohibited degree to the prosecutor, the law declares disqualification; and when such relation is unknown to an accused until after the verdict, a new trial will be granted.

       Juror in criminal case who is related, by blood or marriage, within sixth degree to prosecutor, ascertained according to rules of civil law, is disqualified; and such disqualification, which was unknown to the defendant or the defendant's counsel until after the verdict, or which could not have been ascertained by either of the defendant or defense counsel before the verdict by exercise of due diligence, is cause for new trial.

       - Because no exigency existed to justify a search after the defendant was handcuffed and placed under the watchful eye of a police officer, and even assuming that the defendant was under arrest while being detained in the kitchen, a search of the defendant's bedroom which yielded a shotgun, found under the bed in the bedroom; a box of unspent shotgun shells, and some loose unspent shotgun shells, was not one incident to the arrest; thus, the defendant's possession of a firearm while a convicted felon conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial in which the illegally-obtained evidence could not be introduced.

       Defendant's amended motion for a new trial was properly denied, and an aggravated assault conviction was upheld on appeal, as the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in admitting three photographs depicting the victim's knife wounds; the photographs were not inadmissible merely because the photographs also showed alterations to the victim's body made by medical personnel.

       Because evidence of the defendant's prior drug use, and history of crimes committed against family members fueled by the drug usage, were properly admitted as relevant to the crime's charged, despite incidentally placing the defendant's character in issue, convictions for both aggravated assault and simple assault were upheld on appeal; moreover, even if the trial court erred by admitting this motive evidence, no reversible error resulted which required a new trial.

       - In a prosecution for burglary, because the variance between the indictment and the proof presented at trial did not misinform or mislead the defendant in any manner that resulted in surprise or impaired a defense, and the defendant could not be subjected to another prosecution for the same offense, the alleged variance was not fatal; as a result, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a directed verdict or for a new trial.

       Because the appeals court rejected the defendant's claim that the accusation failed to adequately charge venue, as a charge of DUI incorporated the words "Henry County" in the heading by using the phrase "as prosecuting attorney for the county and state aforesaid" in the body of the accusation, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on that charge; but the court warned the state against such practice, as the solicitor could easily devise forms which stated with clarity the county in which the offense allegedly occurred, and thereby avoid the costs which resulted from having to repeatedly defend the type of challenge the defendant raised.

       - Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied because the defendant did not establish that the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant was aware of all of the charges against the defendant, the defendant did not inform counsel that there were jurors that the defendant wished to have stricken, it was sound trial strategy to not cross-examine the witness because the witness's testimony would have hurt the defendant, counsel did not request a charge on the voluntariness of the defendant's confession because it contradicted the defense of coercion, the evidence adequately demonstrated that the defendant was intoxicated when the defendant committed the assault and robbery, and the discrepancy in the victim's testimony regarding the car the perpetrator drove was not material since the defendant confessed to the crime.

       On appeal from two child molestation convictions, the defendant was properly denied a new trial, because the admission of privileged testimony was not erroneous, and trial counsel was not ineffective by: (a) ignoring a consent order barring the state from introducing any written or oral admissions or statements the defendant made before and after a polygraph examination; (b) failing to assert the attorney-client privilege with respect to a polygraph expert's testimony; and (c) failing to adequately prepare a second polygraph expert who testified for the defense at trial; in fact, (1) counsel neither ignored the consent order nor performed deficiently when stipulating to the admission of the polygraph results; and (2) even assuming that counsel was deficient in failing to consult the defendant regarding the attorney-client privilege, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the result would have been different in the absence of the second expert's cumulative testimony. Adesida v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">280 Ga. App. 764</cite>, <cite class="app_court">634 S.E.2d 880</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as the appeals court found that the trial counsel's tactical decision not to call the defendant's brother and sister-in-law as witnesses was strategic, and nothing in the record suggested that the defendant was denied a fair trial because trial counsel did not investigate the defendant's competency; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Scott v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">281 Ga. App. 106</cite>, <cite class="app_court">635 S.E.2d 582</cite> (2006).

        <p>
       In denying the defendant a new trial, the trial court expressly found that trial counsel was not ineffective, specifically finding that: (1) counsel's decision not to provide the defendant with a copy of the discovery was based on the fact that the defendant could not read and was going to rely on someone else at the jail to read the documents, and that counsel was concerned that showing the discovery to another inmate might produce a "snitch;" and (2) prior to trial, counsel spent two and a half hours with the defendant going over the state's evidence. Hence, the trial court concluded that counsel had a good reason for not giving the defendant a copy of the discovery, and that counsel was exceptionally effective in representing the defendant's interests.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that the defendant's trial counsel was ineffective, as the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different if counsel would have: (1) filed a motion for funds to hire an expert on the reliability of cross-racial eyewitness identification and proffer what the testimony of this expert would have been; (2) verified that funds had been withdrawn from the respective ATM machines on the date of the crime or ascertain whether surveillance cameras might have refuted the state's evidence that the defendant was in the carjacked vehicle; and (3) proffered favorable testimony that the defendant alleged could have been provided by the two victims suggesting complicity.

       As the jury could have found the defendant guilty after listening to the state's witnesses, a psychologist testimony regarding the defendant's competency did not influence the outcome of the trial; hence, defense counsel's failure to object to the psychologist raising the issue about the defendant's mental health was harmless, part of counsel's reasonable trial strategy, and did not amount to the ineffective assistance of counsel entitling the defendant to a new trial.

       In a prosecution for trafficking in cocaine, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of entrapment, as: (1) sufficient evidence was presented that the defendant voluntarily committed the offense upon being given the opportunity to do so; and (2) no evidence was presented to show that the informant employed undue persuasion, incitement or deceit to induce the defendant into selling drugs; thus, the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present evidence to support an entrapment defense was rejected and did not warrant a new trial.

       In a prosecution for armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and obstruction, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on allegations that trial counsel was ineffective, as: (1) a jury charge on the testimony of an accomplice was not required; and (2) in light of trial counsel's cross-examination of the accomplice, the court's credibility charge, as well as the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, a leniency instruction was unnecessary.

       In a prosecution for rape, kidnapping, and sodomy, the defendant did not receive the ineffective assistance of trial counsel merely because counsel failed to impeach the victim's credibility with evidence concerning a 1996 drug arrest, as: (1) the evidence was irrelevant to the circumstances surrounding the defendant's attack on the victim; and (2) the victim never opened the door to an issue of good character; hence, the defendant failed to show that a new trial should have been ordered.

       Counsel's trial strategy in failing to object to hearsay from a non-testifying codefendant was supported by a decision that the testimony was more beneficial than prejudicial, and that the complained-of testimony was necessary to refute the state's theory that the gun admitted against the defendant could have thrown from the defendant's car; moreover, because the defendant failed to show that but for the admission of that evidence, the outcome of the trial would have been different, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on this ground.

       Appellate court rejected the defendant's contention that trial counsel was ineffective: (1) in failing to investigate another molestation charge filed against the defendant; (2) by failing to interview the defendant's mother; (3) in not investigating the state's failure to obtain a warrant to determine whether the defendant's computer contained or could access pornographic material; (4) by referring to the defendant's prior criminal record on DUI charges; (5) in introducing several letters from the defendant's daughter into evidence; and (6) by characterizing the defendant in closing argument as guilty of drunken and boorish behavior, as the trial court was authorized to believe counsel's testimony regarding counsel's sufficient preparation for trial, and finding that without a proffer of evidence concerning the defendant's computer, the defendant could not show a reasonable probability that the results of the proceedings would have been different; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective. Carey v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">281 Ga. App. 816</cite>, <cite class="app_court">637 S.E.2d 757</cite> (2006).

       Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial, which alleged the ineffective assistance of counsel, as mere allegations, without evidence explaining how trial counsel's alleged failures affected the outcome of the trial, could not support the claims and counsel's trial tactics amounted to trial strategy.

       Because there was nothing in the record to rebut the presumption that trial counsel had legitimate reasons for the strategic decisions made during the trial, specifically relating to concerns regarding a juror's dismissal, the state's examination of the victim's mother, the refreshment of the state's witness's recollection, and closing argument, a motion for a new trial was properly denied on these grounds.

       Because the defendant failed to show how trial counsel was ineffective in failing to make objections, failing to file a futile motion to suppress, and failure to object to the admission of evidence, but instead counsel's actions were deemed part of a reasonable trial strategy, the ineffectiveness claim failed and the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on that count.

        <p>
       Defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of defense counsel for failure to pursue a self-defense or justification defense with regard to the shooting death of the victim since at the hearing on the motion for new trial trial counsel testified that, given the state of the evidence, trial counsel did not consider a self-defense strategy to be viable, and would be at odds with the strategy chosen, namely to seek a conviction for the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter. Trial counsel's decision not to pursue inconsistent defenses was made in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment and was reasonable since the evidence from three eye-witnesses showed that the defendant went to the defendant's car and retrieved a pistol, shot the unarmed victim when the victim was retreating, and then went to where the victim lay and shot the victim several more times. Taylor v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 693</cite>, <cite class="app_court">653 S.E.2d 477</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant failed to present the testimony of either trial counsel to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and thus, the record of the new trial hearing was silent as to what actions were taken by counsel to prepare for the plea or to investigate the ramifications of the previous plea, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's withdrawal of the plea. Jackson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">288 Ga. App. 742</cite>, <cite class="app_court">655 S.E.2d 323</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were without merit, because counsel: (1) adequately explained the decision not to call the defendant's spouse; (2) adequately met with the defendant to discuss the trial strategy and regarding the defendant's decision to waive the right to a jury trial; and (3) had reason to decline objection to the admission of an audio recording of the colloquy between the officers and the defendant at the scene, as that decision supported counsel's trial strategy. Thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on those claims. Defrancisco v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga.

       Because trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to point out a purported discrepancy in the evidence to the jury, failing to investigate alleged evidence tampering, and failing to object to the inclusion of a charge on mutual combat in the jury instructions, or reserve objections to the instructions, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial.

       Trial court did not err by rejecting the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on a motion for mistrial because the defendant failed to demonstrate that the defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel. Although the defendant argued that the defendant's trial counsel failed to ask prospective jurors certain questions during voir dire, the defendant made no assertion as to what answers any prospective juror would have given had he or she been asked any of those questions or as to what significance any such answer would have had. The defendant could not show prejudice with regard to the defendant's assertions that counsel failed to fully investigate the case and call essential witnesses because counsel made no proffer as to what a thorough investigation would have uncovered or what the essential witnesses would have said, and the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that an objection or motion for mistrial related to a detective's testimony would have changed the outcome of the defendant's trial.

       Defendant failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to seek a mistrial after successfully objecting to a witness's testimony that the defendant told the witness that "he would have a shoot-out with police before he ever went back to jail" on the ground that the witness's response placed the defendant's character in evidence because even if counsel's failure to request a mistrial were deemed deficient, no mistrial would have been granted as a nonresponsive answer that impacted negatively on a defendant's character did not improperly place the defendant's character in issue, and another witness had already testified without objection that the witness did not call the police on another occasion because the defendant had told that witness "if the cops came he would come out shooting". Because failure to pursue a futile motion did not constitute ineffective assistance, the defendant failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Billings v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">308 Ga. App. 248</cite>, <cite class="app_court">707 S.E.2d 177</cite> (2011).

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because the defendant did not show that: (1) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate the case or meet with the defendant prior to trial; (2) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to interview and cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses as the defendant did not establish a reasonable probability that further interviews and cross-examination would have resulted in a different outcome at trial; (3) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion for immunity from prosecution/plea in bar pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the trial court properly rejected the defendant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce into evidence two medical evaluation documents, which the defendant alleged would have contradicted statements witnesses gave to the police; it was mere speculation that the witnesses' statements were inconsistent with the medical reports.

       Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective because the defendant failed to establish that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged deficiencies, the outcome of the trial would have been different; even assuming that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to object to certain testimony, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different, and even if trial counsel had filed a motion to suppress certain evidence and that evidence had been excluded, the remaining evidence adduced at trial was overwhelming.

       Because the defendant made no showing that the defendant's wife lacked authority to consent to a search of the marital residence, because the trial attorney's strategic decisions not to pursue a defense or to request a jury poll were not patently unreasonable, and because the defendant's claims were not waived by appellate counsel, the defendant failed to show that the defendant was entitled to a new trial based on counsels' alleged ineffectiveness.

       Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to trial counsel's failure to renew a motion for mistrial after the trial court gave a curative instruction because the defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice; trial counsel had twice moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied, and the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in giving the curative instruction, which preserved the defendant's right to a fair trial.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel because any error in excluding a witness's testimony regarding the victim's allegedly prior false accusations of sexual abuse was harmless; the defendant could not show that trial counsel was deficient in failing to investigate a matter of which counsel was unaware of at the time.

       Trial court committed no error in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the defendant could not show that trial counsel was deficient for declining to ask for a contemporaneous limiting instruction; trial counsel did not ask for a contemporaneous limiting instruction on similar transaction evidence since counsel wanted to try to draw the least amount of attention to it as possible, and the trial court gave a limiting instruction on similar transaction evidence in the court's final charge to the jury.

       - Because defense counsel's trial strategy, tactics, and tactical errors did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel and because the defendant did not establish that the deficiency prejudiced the defense, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial was not clearly erroneous.

       Defendant was not erroneously denied a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective, as the evidence, via trial counsel's testimony, showed that: (1) counsel, after gathering the defendant's medical history and interviewing the defendant's medical provider, did not believe the defendant was insane; and (2) counsel, after consulting with the defendant and gaining an approval, made a strategic decision not to pursue a mental health defense, opting instead to pursue a claim of self-defense.

       Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit, and did not warrant a new trial, as the defendant failed to show that trial counsel's actions, in which counsel also represented the codefendant who was the passenger in the vehicle the defendant was driving, prejudiced the defense; further, counsel's actions did not slight the defense of one defendant for another, the principles contained in charges on mere presence and equal access were adequate, counsel was prepared for trial, and the prosecutor's closing argument statements were not prejudicial so as to warrant an objection.

       In a murder prosecution, the appeals court rejected the defendant's claims that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue a battered woman syndrome defense and by failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter, as: (1) the evidence showed that the defendant, after consultation with counsel, instead chose to focus exclusively on the defense of justification; (2) the evidence did not support a voluntary manslaughter charge; and (3) the defendant did not want the trial court to charge on voluntary manslaughter. Moreover, at the new trial hearing, because appellate counsel did not ask trial counsel about the decision not to seek the manslaughter instruction, that decision was presumed to be strategic. Ballard v. State, <cite class="ga_court">281 Ga. 232</cite>, <cite class="app_court">637 S.E.2d 401</cite> (2006).

       Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as: (1) the defendant failed to give any specific examples of prejudice; (2) the defendant, after consultation with counsel, testified freely and voluntarily; and (3) any objections counsel might have made to a videotaped statement would have lacked merit, as those statements contained evidence of prior difficulties, admissible without notice and without the need for a pretrial hearing; hence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on those grounds. Campbell v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">282 Ga. App. 854</cite>, <cite class="app_court">640 S.E.2d 358</cite> (2006).

       Because the defendant failed to show that: (1) trial counsel's performance was deficient in failing to call a forensic interviewer as a witness, and that failure prejudiced the defense and would have changed the outcome of the trial; (2) trial counsel's decision not to object to the properly admitted testimony from a forensic interviewer as to the opinion rendered on the victim's intelligence and reactions to certain questions which were consistent with abuse was not ineffective; and (3) the defendant could not show that the failure to call the trial attorney affected the outcome of a motion for a new trial, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims against both trial and appellate counsel lacked merit; thus, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Freeman v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">282 Ga. App. 185</cite>, <cite class="app_court">638 S.E.2d 358</cite> (2006).

       Appeals court rejected the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding the admission of a tape-recorded statement and claim that trial counsel should have demanded a Jackson-Denno hearing or a hearing to determine the admissibility of a similar transaction, as: (1) proper res gestae evidence could be admitted without having to follow the rules regarding prior similar transactions; (2) assuming that trial counsel should have demanded a Jackson-Denno hearing, the defendant failed to show how a hearing would have altered the outcome of the trial; and (3) at a hearing on the motion for a new trial, the defendant failed to introduce any evidence whatsoever to suggest that the statement made was involuntary. White v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">282 Ga. App. 286</cite>, <cite class="app_court">638 S.E.2d 426</cite> (2006).

       Because the defendant failed to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with affirmative evidence showing an infringement of rights or a procedural irregularity in the taking of a prior guilty plea, and the defendant failed to show that an objection by trial counsel to the introduction of the prior plea would have been successful, a claim that trial counsel was ineffective, thus warranting a new trial, lacked merit.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective, specifically as to issues of the defendant's competency to stand trial and getting the defendant to agree to a bench trial, as: (1) the record showed that defense counsel adequately pursued the competency issue, filed pre-trial discovery motions, obtained an order for defendant's mental evaluation, hired a forensic psychologist to evaluate the defendant's competency, presented and examined witnesses, cross-examined the state's witnesses, and made a closing argument; (2) even if the court were to assume that trial counsel's failure to interview the various doctors constituted deficient performance, the defendant failed to show any prejudice resulting therefrom; and (3) the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was deficient regarding the decision to pursue a bench trial rather than a jury trial, given that the trial court found that the defendant agreed that the case should be submitted to the court on stipulated facts, rather than to the jury. Wafford v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 154</cite>, <cite class="app_court">640 S.E.2d 727</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to specifically challenged testimony presented against the defendant, and a new trial was not warranted based on that
   ineffectiveness, as: (1) counsel explained at the hearing on the new trial motion that objections were not made for strategic and tactical reasons, so as to not draw attention to some of the testimony; (2) some of the testimony hurt the credibility of the state's witnesses while enhancing the credibility of the defense theory; (3) counsel attempted to engender sympathy for the defendant; and (4) the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the objections would have been made. Walls v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 560</cite>, <cite class="app_court">642 S.E.2d 195</cite> (2007).

        <p>
       Because trial counsel was adequately prepared for trial, effectively engaged in plea negotiations, made timely objections, properly handled the defense, was not required to make meritless objections, and the defendant ultimately failed to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged errors, the result of the trial would have been different, counsel was found to not be ineffective; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Garrett v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 282</cite>, <cite class="app_court">645 S.E.2d 718</cite> (2007).

       On retrial on one count of child molestation and two counts of aggravated child molestation, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective in admitting notes generated by a forensic evaluator who interviewed the child victim, as the defendant had previously been found guilty in the first trial in which the notes were not introduced. Mewborn v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 187</cite>, <cite class="app_court">645 S.E.2d 669</cite> (2007).

       Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to obtain a mental evaluation of the defendant prior to trial to determine criminal responsibility, absent record evidence that counsel had advance notice of any mental health problems, and further discussions with the defendant's family would not have revealed a history of significant mental illness; hence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on those grounds. Breland v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 251</cite>, <cite class="app_court">648 S.E.2d 389</cite> (2007).

       Because a transcript of the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial was not included in the record on appeal, and absent any other proffer of the additional testimony and evidence that the alleged favorable witnesses would have testified to, the defendant could not show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had trial counsel subpoenaed the witnesses; hence, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on that foundation failed. Dukes v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 172</cite>, <cite class="app_court">645 S.E.2d 664</cite> (2007).

       Despite the defendant's contrary claims, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to subpoena witnesses necessary to support a defense and failing to adequately raise all issues in the defendant's motion to suppress and motion for independent analysis of the suspected narcotics as: (1) the defendant failed to supply sufficient information about the whereabouts of the witnesses; (2) the defendant failed to produce the witnesses at the motion for a new trial hearing; (3) counsel's strategy in handling the suppression motion showed an appropriate exercise of discretion; and (4) under the theory of defense presented, counsel was not ineffective by failing to obtain an independent examination of the substance tested.

       The Court of Appeals of Georgia upheld an order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on counsel's alleged failure to communicate lacked merit, given that no reasonable probability existed, nor did the defendant offer any, that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent counsel's alleged deficient performance.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's amended motion for a new trial based on trial counsel's alleged ineffective assistance as the evidence failed to show that counsel's trial strategy was unreasonable, the defendant failed to show prejudice by counsel's actions, and the defendant failed to preserve some of the challenges to counsel's actions for appellate review.

       On appeal from convictions on one count of aggravated sexual battery and two counts of sexual assault, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial as the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from counsel's failure to call the defendant's wife to testify for the defense, and the appeals court refused to speculate that the wife's testimony would have led to an acquittal. Lee v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">286 Ga. App. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">650 S.E.2d 320</cite> (2007).

       <p>
        <p>
       Because it appeared that trial counsel's strategy was to convince the court that insufficient circumstantial evidence was presented in order to convict the defendant, and counsel's decision not to hire an expert to testify as to how quickly the defendant could become intoxicated was a tactical matter to avoid getting into a battle of the experts, those decisions did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel sufficient to warrant a new trial. O'Connell v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 835</cite>, <cite class="app_court">648 S.E.2d 147</cite> (2007).

       Trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, as counsel was not ineffective in failing to: (1) make meritless objections; (2) raise what was considered a novel legal argument; (3) file futile motions that would not have changed the outcome of trial; (4) require corroboration of the defendant's confession; and (5) anticipate that the defendant's wife might mislead the defense; moreover, the defendant's claim that counsel was inadequately prepared for trial was belied by the record.

        <p>
       Because trial counsel's strategic decision not to call a close family friend as a witness, who could have rebutted the state's evidence that the defendant was controlling, was supported by testimony that the witness would not have added anything to the defense and might have diluted the defendant's voluntary manslaughter theory, counsel was not ineffective in failing to have the witness testify; thus, the defendant was properly denied a new trial. Johnson v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 96</cite>, <cite class="app_court">646 S.E.2d 216</cite> (2007).

       Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as a motion to strike or for a mistrial after the state's expert offered an opinion as to the victim's failure to immediately report the abuse was meritless, and counsel's decision as to how to present the defendant's testimony fell within the realm of reasonable trial strategy, and therefore could not be considered deficient; thus, the claims could not serve as the basis for a new trial. Gaines v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 654</cite>, <cite class="app_court">647 S.E.2d 357</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court properly denied the defendant's amended motion for a new trial as: (1) the defendant failed to support an assertion that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to listen to an audiotape of the defendant's second interview with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation prior to trial; (2) counsel's offhand comment as to hindsight was insufficient to support an inference of deficient performance; and (3) the defendant failed to show that prejudice resulted from counsel's alleged deficiency.

       <p>
        <p>
       Because trial counsel did not provide the defendant with ineffective assistance to the extent that the relevant strategic decisions made would not have affected the outcome of the trial, and counsel properly chose not to object to the court's failure to merge a kidnapping and false imprisonment conviction, as those were independent offenses, the defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied.

       Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial on appeal from the defendant's convictions of child molestation and aggravated child molestation because: (1) venue was adequately shown by the testimony of a single witness; (2) the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective by failing to prepare for trial, investigate the case, subpoena important documents, interview key witnesses, and object to damaging testimony; and (3) the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for counsel's alleged shortcomings. Brooks v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">286 Ga. App. 209</cite>, <cite class="app_court">648 S.E.2d 724</cite> (2007).

       Rape conviction was upheld on appeal as the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on defense counsel's failure to object to certain testimony from the victim about the defendant's history of selling drugs and failure to subpoena certain medical records, as: (1) testimony from the victim that the defendant gave the victim drugs before some of the sexual encounters between them was admissible as part of the res gestae; and (2) the medical records were generally consistent with the victim's testimony, and therefore no prejudice resulted from failing to subpoena them. Mitchell v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 517</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 821</cite> (2007).

       In a battery prosecution, setting aside the defendant's failure to object to a second attorney's representation at trial, a denial from the defendant's first attorney of an alleged promise to represent the defendant after that counsel's suspension had expired gave the trial court sufficient grounds for finding that no such promise occurred, eliminating the defendant's denial of the right to counsel claim; moreover, inasmuch as the defendant failed to challenge the trial court's finding that the second attorney's representation was effective, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Northington v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 96</cite>, <cite class="app_court">650 S.E.2d 760</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object when a medical examiner testified that the victim's death was a homicide and not an accident, and despite the defendant's contrary claim, the testimony was not an expression of the witness' opinion on the ultimate issue in the case, as: (1) counsel did not consider the testimony objectionable because there was no dispute that the "manner" of the victim's death was a homicide, and such tactic was not unreasonable; (2) the ultimate issue for the jury to determine was whether the defendant acted with malice, in response to the victim's provocation, or whether self-defense was an issue; (3) counsel testified that an objection would have been in order had the medical examiner invaded the province of the jury by expressing the opinion that the homicide was a murder; and (4) the defendant failed to show any prejudice by the testimony presented. Berry v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 376</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 1</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel based on said counsel's failure to call certain witnesses, as the testimony that these witnesses would have provided would not have affected the outcome of the trial, and counsel was not ineffective to the extent that the defendant was denied the right to testify at trial, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial. Finch v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 478</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because trial counsel's decision not to object to statements that might have impugned the defendant's character was a tactical one, the trial court properly found that trial counsel was not ineffective; thus, the defendant was properly denied a new trial on those grounds. Page v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 182</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 131</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant was unable to establish prejudice resulting from trial counsel's alleged shortcomings, specifically that counsel was unprepared for trial, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on that ground. Bradford v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 356</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant did not claim below that trial counsel was ineffective for opening the door to impeachment, the defendant failed to timely raise this argument, and thus the claim was waived for purposes of appeal; as a result, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds. Lipsey v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 835</cite>, <cite class="app_court">652 S.E.2d 870</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because counsels' advice against putting the defendant on the stand was tactical, counsel made the strategic decision not to strike a challenged juror, and the record reflected the basis for counsels' objection and motion for a mistrial during the state's closing argument, the defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result. Warner v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 892</cite>, <cite class="app_court">652 S.E.2d 898</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because a trial counsel's decision not to request a jury charge on a lesser-included offense in order to pursue an all-or-nothing defense was a matter of trial strategy, and there was no indication that the defendant would have agreed to charges on lesser-included offenses, given that the defendant relied on a claim of innocence, counsel was not ineffective in failing to request an instruction on a lesser-included offense; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on this ground. Davis v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 786</cite>, <cite class="app_court">653 S.E.2d 104</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding the defendant's initial post-trial counsel's performance lacked merit, as counsel was neither professionally deficient nor prejudicial because: (1) the defendant waived any right to be present at the two juror interviews; (2) no deficiency could result from counsel's failure to raise meritless objections; and (3) the trial court specifically found that the defendant adequately understood the nature of the charges, comprehended the proceedings, despite being under the influence of prescribed anti-depressants, and was capable of aiding the defense. Hampton v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 490</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 698</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in presenting a defense and requesting jury instructions on the defendant's claim of innocence, and was authorized to forego objection to a challenged portion of the state's closing argument, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit and did not warrant a new trial. King v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 505</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 711</cite> (2007).

       Ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding the defendant's initial post-trial counsel's performance lacked merit, as counsel was neither professionally deficient nor prejudicial because: (1) the defendant waived any right to be present at the two juror interviews; (2) no deficiency could result from counsel's failure to raise meritless objections; and (3) the trial court specifically found that the defendant adequately understood the nature of the charges, and comprehended the proceedings, despite being under the influence of prescribed anti-depressants, and was capable of aiding the defense; thus, the evidence did not provide an adequate basis for the appellate court to conclude that the outcome of an amended motion for a new trial would have been different. Hampton v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 490</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 698</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to call a witness who would have testified that the victim fabricated claims of molestation, given evidence that: (1) the witness did not inform counsel of the witness before trial; (2) counsel articulated valid reasons for not calling the witness; (3) counsel challenged the state's evidence, arguing that the claims were fabricated; and (4) the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from counsel's actions, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Noe v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 728</cite>, <cite class="app_court">652 S.E.2d 620</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because any deficiency in counsel's failure to object to an investigator's testimony regarding the hearsay statements of an informant did not prejudice the defendant's defense, the jury was likely to deduce that the defendant was on parole from the fact that a parole officer initiated a search, and pretermitting whether the defendant's response to the investigator's request to search constituted "pre-arrest silence," no deficiency existed in counsel's reasonable strategic decision that the evidence was consistent with the defense, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit. Cauley v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 701</cite>, <cite class="app_court">652 S.E.2d 586</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because: (1) it was likely that a mistrial would not have been granted after a police investigator testified about past dealings with the defendant; and (2) trial counsel's failure to request a curative instruction about the alleged improper injection of character evidence or question a witness about a note in which that witness recanted a statement amounted to reasonable trial strategy, the appeals court found that the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit. Thus, a new trial based on those claims was unwarranted. Head v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">288 Ga. App. 205</cite>, <cite class="app_court">653 S.E.2d 540</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from trial counsel's failure to investigate potential character witnesses and failure to "re-advise" the defendant of the right to testify following the state's introduction of rebuttal evidence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on these grounds. Thomas v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 894</cite>, <cite class="app_court">655 S.E.2d 599</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims did not warrant a new trial because counsel's trial tactics did not amount to ineffective assistance: (1) the defendant could not complain from a self-made choice to testify; (2) counsel's closing argument was not deficient; and (3) counsel could not be ineffective simply because another attorney might have used different language or placed a different emphasis on the evidence. Davenport v. State, <cite class="ga_court">283 Ga. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 844</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the trial court was entitled to believe counsel's testimony at the hearing on the motion for new trial that counsel advised the defendant of the right to testify at trial and that counsel met numerous times with the defendant, with ample opportunity to discuss all aspects of the case with counsel, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim in support of a motion for a new trial had to be rejected. Warren v. State, <cite class="ga_court">283 Ga. 42</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 803</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request jury voir dire to determine whether jurors saw the defendant wearing handcuffs, and because sufficient evidence supported the defendant's burglary conviction to make a directed verdict of acquittal unnecessary, a motion for a new trial was properly denied. Brown v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 297</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 582</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because: (1) the defendant failed to show that counsel was deficient in failing to impeach a cohort in the crimes charged with a prior felony conviction; (2) counsel made the strategic decision to restrict the scope of the cohort's cross-examination; and (3) the defendant could not show any prejudice resulting from the counsel's actions, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit. Thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result of that claim. Jones v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 219</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 556</cite> (2008), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 381 (Ga. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the evidence showed that: (1) the defendant's trial counsel spent sufficient time investigating and preparing the case; (2) the defendant failed to present evidence of the victim's alleged "false reporting" conviction at the hearing on the motion for new trial or show how counsel's cross-examination of the victim on the false reporting would have affected the outcome of the trial; and (3) trial counsel contacted each and every person the defendant identified as a witness, the defendant's motion for a new trial on grounds that counsel was ineffective was properly denied. Kilby v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 457</cite>, <cite class="app_court">657 S.E.2d 567</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       On appeal from convictions on two counts of child molestation and one count of aggravated sexual battery, the trial court properly found that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on allegations of the ineffective assistance of defense counsel because: (1) the manner in which counsel handled alleged exculpatory evidence pertaining to a similar transaction witness and the cross-examination of that witness, was part of counsel's reasonable trial strategy; (2) the defendant's reciprocal discovery or due process rights were not violated; and (3) the existence of the information sought was known to the defendant, which could have been obtained with due diligence. Ellis v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 452</cite>, <cite class="app_court">657 S.E.2d 562</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not warrant a new trial in a prosecution for rape, kidnapping, aggravated stalking, and two counts of stalking; because of the limited nature of a challenged witnesses' trial testimony, defense counsel made a strategic decision not to seek recusal of the trial judge, who was the brother of the challenged witness, and counsel discussed with the defendant the reasons for not seeking recusal. Pirkle v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">657 S.E.2d 560</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       New trial based on counsel's alleged ineffectiveness was unwarranted because the defendant made no affirmative showing that the purported deficiencies in trial counsel's representation in investigating a claim of possible jury tampering amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and were not examples of a conscious and deliberate trial strategy. Dowels v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 369</cite>, <cite class="app_court">657 S.E.2d 279</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because: (1) the defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing that the state possessed favorable information, or that the trial's outcome might have been different if videotapes from the cameras on the vehicles of the two responding officers had been produced; and (2) counsel was not required to make an objection to the admission of similar transaction evidence when such would have been futile, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result. Hinton v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 479</cite>, <cite class="app_court">659 S.E.2d 841</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant failed to present any evidence of prejudice from trial counsels' alleged deficiency in failing to explore the possibility that the defendant's mental illness might have provided a viable trial defense, and that one counsel failed to adequately prepare the defendant for taking the witness stand, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. Icenhour v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">659 S.E.2d 858</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       New trial based on counsel's alleged ineffectiveness was properly denied because the defendant's numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit; the defendant failed to show that: (1) the number of different instructions sought; (2) any additional investigation or preparation; (3) an objection to evidence of the prior difficulties between the defendant and the victim, and request for a contemporaneous limiting instruction; and (4) a request for an instruction on a defense not alleged, would have changed the outcome of the trial, and the tactical decision as to which defense to pursue was part of a reasonable trial strategy. Breazeale v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">660 S.E.2d 376</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from trial counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in failing to discover and introduce the criminal record of one of the witnesses for the prosecution for impeachment purposes, a new trial was properly denied. Rivers v. State, <cite class="ga_court">283 Ga. 108</cite>, <cite class="app_court">657 S.E.2d 210</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In prosecution against defendant on two counts of child molestation, because trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request a specific jury charge addressing alleged improper bolstering testimony, present any expert testimony which was not helpful to defense, and elicit available favorable evidence and impeach the victim's testimony, defendant's convictions of related offenses were upheld on appeal; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective. Rouse v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">290 Ga. App. 740</cite>, <cite class="app_court">660 S.E.2d 476</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       As a defendant failed to raise an issue regarding the alleged bolstering of a victim by a witness for the state in the defendant's motion for a new trial based on the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel, the issue was not preserved for purposes of appellate review. Carroll v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">292 Ga. App. 795</cite>, <cite class="app_court">665 S.E.2d 883</cite> (2008).
       </p>

        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain an electronic enhancement of a videotape depicting a drug sale, which allegedly would have shown that the defendant was not the perpetrator of the offense, because the defendant failed to show that the defendant was prejudiced as a result of trial counsel's failure to obtain an electronic enhancement of the videotape prior to trial since the enhanced images failed to create a reasonable probability that the defendant was not the perpetrator depicted in the images. Moreover, an undercover officer unequivocally identified the defendant as the perpetrator based upon the officer's personal observations and independent memory of the defendant at the time of the drug sale, and although the defendant attempted to prove that another individual was the perpetrator depicted in the videotape's images, the defendant failed to proffer sufficient evidence in support of the defendant's claim. Faulkner v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">304 Ga. App. 791</cite>, <cite class="app_court">697 S.E.2d 914</cite> (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel's decision not to object to a police officer's passing reference to the defendant's post-arrest silence was a valid exercise of reasonable professional judgment, the defendant failed to rebut the presumption that counsel performed within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance in failing to challenge hearsay testimony, counsel's defense strategy of implicating the codefendants was not unreasonable, and counsel did not fail to present evidence as promised in the counsel's opening statement. Jackson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">306 Ga. App. 33</cite>, <cite class="app_court">701 S.E.2d 481</cite> (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to statements the prosecutor made during closing argument because counsel did object, and defense counsel's objection was successful; while the defendant asserted that counsel should have further moved for a mistrial, such decisions generally fell within the ambit of strategy and tactics. Wilson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">306 Ga. App. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">703 S.E.2d 400</cite> (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to a question directed to an accomplice because counsel personally opened the line of questioning on cross-examination, and in the absence of counsel's testimony, it was presumed to be a strategic decision; having made that decision, trial counsel could not object, and because trial counsel succeeded in obtaining acquittal on the three most serious charges against the defendant that strongly supported the conclusion that the assistance actually rendered by trial counsel fell within that broad range of reasonably effective assistance that members of the bar in good standing were presumed to render. Wilson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">306 Ga. App. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">703 S.E.2d 400</cite> (2010).

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the codefendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to testimony from one of the victims and a police officer regarding the codefendant's prior purchase of marijuana from one of the victims because drug use showed the codefendant's motive to rob a home where the codefendant believed illegal drugs and money would be found; an accomplice testified that the motive for the robbery was that the victims kept drugs and cash in the apartment and that the codefendant planned the robbery and knew that drugs and money were kept in the house. Wilson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">306 Ga. App. 827</cite>, <cite class="app_court">703 S.E.2d 400</cite> (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial when a state's witness interjected bad character evidence because the witness's improper remarks were fleeting, unsolicited, and nonresponsive to the prosecutor's examination questions, and since the defendant did not show that the defendant was otherwise entitled to a mistrial based upon the circumstances, trial counsel's failure to pursue a meritless motion does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel; the trial court sustained the objections to the improper testimony and instructed the prosecutor and witness to restrict the examination and responses, the witness and prosecutor complied with the trial court's instructions, and there was no further mention of the bad character evidence. Boatright v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">308 Ga. App. 266</cite>, <cite class="app_court">707 S.E.2d 158</cite> (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel's decision not to request the production of the duct tape that was used to bind the defendant when the defendant was allegedly kidnapped was not patently unreasonable because the duct tape itself was cumulative of evidence that was introduced through the defendant's recorded police interview and trial counsel's cross-examination of a detective; even if it was assumed that trial counsel performed deficiently, the defendant proffered no evidence at the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial that an analysis of the duct tape would have bolstered the defendant's alibi defense. Buis v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">309 Ga. App. 644</cite>, <cite class="app_court">710 S.E.2d 850</cite> (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because trial counsel's failure to object to a detective's testimony did not amount to deficient performance since the testimony was not a statement of the victim's credibility or an invasion of the province of the jury; the testimony concerned the detective's reason for ending the interview with the victim and referring the victim to the Georgia Center of Child Advocacy, and even if the testimony that "a molestation incident occurred" did constitute improper bolstering, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the testimony so prejudiced the defense as to affect the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, the motion was also properly denied because trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's comments during closing argument did not constitute deficient performance; the comments of which defendant complained were permissible since the comments were the conclusion the prosecutor wished the jury to draw from the evidence and not a statement of the prosecutor's personal belief as to the veracity of a witness. Strickland v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">311 Ga. App. 400</cite>, <cite class="app_court">715 S.E.2d 798</cite> (2011).
       </p>
       <p>

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no evidence to support an instruction on defense of habitation pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       Because the armed robbery count of the indictment sufficiently alleged the elements of armed robbery, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge armed robbery, and the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial as to the ineffective assistance claim; that the property was taken from the person or immediate presence of another is necessarily inferred from the allegation of a use of an offensive weapon to accomplish the taking, and the alleged offense of "armed robbery" can be accomplished only via a taking from the person or immediate presence of another.

       Trial court did not err when the court denied the portion of the codefendant's motion for new trial alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel because the alleged deficiencies in trial counsel's performance were either without factual basis or were decisions made as matters of trial strategy.

       Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the state's argument that no person in the circuit had ever been convicted and later proven innocent because the trial court would not have abused the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial had one been made and did not err when the court credited trial counsel's decision not to object to the prosecutor's closing argument as strategic; even assuming that the prosecutor should not have compared the defendant to others, the subject of wrongful convictions in other cases was brought up by the defendant, and the jury was not impressed either way by the colloquy.

       - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because the defendant failed to show that the defendant's trial counsel was actually intoxicated on the second morning of the trial and that the defendant's counsel's performance after consuming alcohol affected the outcome of the defendant's trial; nothing in the record showed that the trial court erred in finding that there were no deficiencies in counsel's performance on the second morning of the trial.

       - Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not warrant a new trial because sufficient evidence of the defendant's intoxication was presented in the record, and the defendant failed to show prejudice resulting from trial counsel's failure to object to defendant's admission to having a prior DUI conviction, even though it was error for trial counsel not to object.

       New trial was unwarranted because: (1) the decision not to present the defendant's love interest as an alibi witness was clearly strategic, and thus, could not serve as the basis for an ineffectiveness claim; and (2) counsel's alleged failure to specifically object to the victim's testimony on bolstering and not on leading and speculation grounds impermissibly expanded the enumerated error.

       Because the defendant waived a confrontation clause, as well as any other constitutional objection, to testimony concerning a statement overheard from a woman fleeing the scene of the crime on appeal, and the victim's testimony, as well as the defendant's own admission, supported a robbery by intimidation conviction, such was upheld on appeal; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial.

       Trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial, given sufficient evidence that: (1) the defendant's convictions for malice murder and other related crimes were supported by the evidence; (2) the jury properly decided against a voluntary manslaughter verdict based on that evidence; (3) evidentiary issues did not warrant a mistrial; (4) the state did not act in bad faith in failing to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence; and (5) no due process violation occurred by the admission of cumulative evidence.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as sufficient evidence supported the rape, aggravated sodomy, and incest convictions, similar transaction evidence was admitted for a proper purpose, and the imposition of a life imprisonment sentence as a recidivist child molester did not render O.C.G.A.

       Trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial, as the state's commentary during opening and closing argument on the connection between illegal drugs and crime in the community was proper, no abuse of discretion resulted from the admission of the defendant's booking mug shot, and the state's identification witnesses could testify about their level of certainty in identifying the defendant.

       Given sufficient evidence presented by the state of the defendant's involvement in the armed robbery and murder of the victim as a party to the crimes, no errors in the content and order of the jury charges, and the lack of evidence supporting the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial.

       In a prosecution for statutory rape, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial as: (1) the indictment adequately set forth a charge of felony statutory rape; (2) the evidence showed the defendant to be over 21 years old and more than three years older than the victim; (3) the trial court was not required to sentence the defendant for misdemeanor statutory rape, and in fact was precluded from doing so; and (4) the defendant failed to make a written request that the jury be charged on the law under former O.C.G.A.

       Because sufficient evidence was presented that the defendant physically assaulted an off-duty sheriff's officer prior to arrest and continued to resist and obstruct the officer's official duties thereafter, the defendant was properly denied an acquittal and a new trial; moreover, given that the trial court properly charged the jury on the obstruction offense, explaining that a person committed the offense by knowingly and willfully obstructing or hindering a law enforcement officer in the lawful discharge of that officer's official duties, nothing beyond such was required.

       On appeal from a conviction for two counts of aggravated child molestation, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial, as no abuse of discretion resulted in excluding evidence that one of the victims made prior false accusations of sexual abuse against an older cousin, because the evidence presented a credibility issue for the trial court to resolve in analyzing whether there was a reasonable probability of falsity.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on grounds that a refusal to submit to voluntary field sobriety tests was testimonial in nature, and thus subject to the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, as a refusal to submit to the tests was not testimonial in nature, and the mere fact that the defendant refused to submit to a blood test was not subject to the privilege against self-incrimination since no impermissible coercion was involved, regardless of the form of refusal.

       Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial, and an aggravated assault conviction was upheld on appeal, as the state was not required to show that the defendant expressed an intent to rob or declared a purpose to carry that intent into effect, for the jury to arrive at the conclusion that such was the defendant's intent; moreover, the defendant's intention could be gathered from the circumstances of the case as proved, and in seeking the motives of human conduct, inferences and deductions could properly be considered when the inferences and deductions flowed naturally from the facts proved.

       Because the "direct sequencing" method of the mitochondrial DNA analysis used by the crime lab was properly used in prosecuting the defendant for murder, and a spontaneous outburst was admissible as a non-custodial and voluntary statement, a conviction for malice murder, and resulting sentence, were affirmed on appeal; hence, the defendant was properly denied a new trial. Vaughn v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 99</cite>, <cite class="app_court">646 S.E.2d 212</cite> (2007).

       Because: (1) the defendant's noncustodial and spontaneous remark to an officer was admissible; (2) the defendant's mug shot did not erroneously place character in issue; and (3) the victim was conscious of the crime as the crime was being committed, a jury charge on theft by taking as a lesser-included offense of robbery by sudden snatching was not required, and a new trial was unwarranted.

       In a negligence action seeking damages for a disabling injury filed against a property owner by a friend who assisted the owner in building a fence, because the evidence supported a verdict against the friend, and the trial court's various evidentiary rulings regarding: (1) the admission of evidence under both the medical records and business records exceptions to the hearsay rule; (2) the admission of evidence regarding the parties' friendship; (3) the impeachment of the friend's credibility; (4) the opening statement presented by the owner's counsel; and (5) the use of a leading question regarding the friend's use of Oxycontin, did not support a different result, the friend was not entitled to a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

       The fact that one of the victims was told that the first defendant had a gun, believed such, became frightened as a result, and hurriedly gave the first defendant the cash demanded, amounted to sufficient circumstantial evidence from which the jury could find that the victim reasonably believed an offensive weapon was being used in the robbery; hence, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the armed robbery convictions of both defendants and uphold the denial of the defendant's motion for a new trial on this ground.

       While the state conceded that the state violated the Bruton rule by referring to the codefendant's comment in the state's opening statement, because neither of the defendants showed any harm by the error, that error was deemed harmless; moreover, given that the evidence, including eyewitness identification, was overwhelming, the trial court did not err in denying a new trial on this ground.

       Because: (1) an indictment adequately charged the defendant with aggravated assault; (2) sufficient evidence supported the charge; (3) similar transaction evidence was admitted for a proper purpose; and (4) defense counsel's alleged omissions would not have affected the outcome and therefore did not amount to the ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial.

       Because the trial judge took the appropriate curative steps in denying an opposing driver's motions for both a mistrial and a new trial after the suing driver made an inadvertent reference to insurance, including rebuking the suing driver and issuing a curative instruction, the court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the opposing driver's motions; moreover, the appeals court could not conclude that the opposing driver suffered any wrong or oppression as a result of the trial court's orders.

       Despite the defendant's claim that the state failed to disprove a claim of self-defense, the appeals court upheld the defendant's aggravated assault conviction, because sufficient evidence was presented by the state to allow the jury to decide that the defendant's act of stabbing the weaponless victim amounted to excessive force. Thus, the defendant's motion for a new trial on the issue was properly denied. Richards v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">288 Ga.

       Given the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, including identification evidence from the victim and five other eyewitnesses, and the fact that none of the defendant's 21 ineffective assistance of counsel claims were sufficient enough to have led to a different outcome at trial, the defendant's convictions were upheld on appeal. Thus, an acquittal and a new trial were properly denied. Ruffin v. State, <cite class="ga_court">283 Ga. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 140</cite> (2008).

       Trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial because: (1) the trial court's admission of cash invoices and a jail inventory list was not improper; (2) the alleged misidentification evidence was irrelevant, given the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's positive identification; and (3) an ineffective assistance of counsel claim was abandoned, and otherwise, even if it was not abandoned, the appeals court held that the claim lacked merit.

       Because: (1) the testimony of two witnesses, as well as that of the defendant, sufficiently established the element of venue; and (2) the trial court gave complete instructions on the defendant's defense of justification and self-defense, and thus, a charge on mistake of fact was not warranted, there was no reason to reverse the defendant's convictions of aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Thus, the defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied. Gaines v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga.

       In a contract dispute between a homeowner and a construction contractor hired to finish the homeowner's unfinished basement, the Court of Appeals of Georgia erred by reversing the trial court's denial of the homeowner's motion for a new trial because there was some evidence supporting the jury's finding that the contract between the parties was not so uncertain as to be unenforceable.

       Despite waiving error regarding a show up identification, because: (1) a victim's identification of the defendant as one of the perpetrators of a burglary, robbery, and battery was sufficient and non-suggestive; and (2) the corroborating testimony from the defendant's two accomplices was admissible to support the defendant's convictions, as both accomplices testified as to the defendant's involvement in the crimes, those convictions were upheld on appeal; thus, new trial was properly denied.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial, which was based upon the defendant's claim that the prosecutor's admonishment of the sole defense witness deprived the defendant of due process because the defendant did not show that the prosecutor's conduct dissuaded a defense witness from testifying or that the prosecutor induced materially less favorable testimony; the witness testified and did so in the defendant's favor, when the witness took the stand the witness did not invoke the Fifth Amendment and did not otherwise refuse to answer any question posed to the witness, and the defendant's lawyer made no attempt to show that the defense witness had made the purported prior inconsistent statement, that the cocaine at issue, in fact, had belonged to the witness, acknowledging at the new trial hearing that counsel simply had made a strategic decision not to ask the witness that question.

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by refusing to declare a mistrial because the prosecutor's remarks during closing argument did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial since the prosecutor's remarks did not insinuate that the defendant had attempted to kill any of the officers involved in the case, but instead, the remarks related, in part, to the defendant's obviously precarious situation given the investigator's response to the investigator's encounter with the defendant, namely, drawing the investigator's gun; after being cautioned by the trial court that the wide latitude afforded counsel during closing argument was not boundless, the prosecutor did not revisit the point concerning police officers but turned to the more narrow encounter between the defendant and the victim, which gave rise to the aggravated assault count.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial on the ground that certain testimony was beyond the scope of the state's pre-trial notice because the evidence was essentially cumulative of the witness's testimony that the defendant pointed a pistol at the witness, and it was highly probable that the testimony did not contribute to the verdicts given the weight of the evidence implicating the defendant; it was not clear from the witness's testimony whether the defendant's display of the defendant's pistol and the defendant's query whether the witness was "still brave" was so closely tied to the defendant's act of pointing the defendant's pistol at the witness that the notice provided sufficient particulars of the incident such that the defendant's defense could not have been harmed by the failure to provide more specific information.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial because the prosecutor's opening statement, which informed the jury that although the jury could hear a claim that the defendant and the codefendant were carjacked and forced to try to elude the police, the evidence would show that there were only two occupants in the vehicle that led police on the high-speed chase, referred to a statement by the defendant and not the codefendant and did not inculpate either the defendant or the codefendant; therefore, the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses was not violated.

       Evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's convictions for armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon beyond a reasonable doubt, and the trial court properly denied the defendant's motions for directed verdict and new trial because the jury could have determined that a witness's testimony provided corroboration for the codefendant's identification of the defendant; further corroboration for the testimony of the witness and the codefendant was provided by a neighbors' description of the robbery and shooting, by the description of the codefendant's wife of the codefendant's demeanor and behavior that day, and by physical evidence found at the scene.

       - As the jury was properly instructed as to the charged offense of criminal attempt to obtain possession of a controlled substance by forgery, the defendant did not request that the word "forgery" be defined, and the defendant did not take the position that forgery was a lesser-included offense of the crime of attempting to obtain possession of a controlled substance by forgery, a new trial was properly denied; further, the term "forgery," was not so obscure or technical that the term required the court to sua sponte define the term for the jury.

       Because the jury instructions issued by the trial court were neither confusing nor misleading, and provided full and fair instruction on the issues in the case, specifically, as to the value of the stolen property the defendant possessed, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on this ground.

       Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request in writing a jury instruction that excluded a statement that witnesses were presumed to speak the truth unless impeached, and the trial court did not clearly err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on this ground. The court charged the jury that the jury could consider a number of factors, including a witness's manner of testifying, the witnesses' means and opportunity for knowing the facts to which the witnesses testified, and the probability or improbability of the witnesses' testimony.

       - When a trial court overrules a motion to strike testimony on cross-examination as being hearsay because counsel had an opportunity previously to object to that testimony, had let it become evidence, and had called it to the attention of the witness, thus being the party going into the matter and allowing the opposing party to cross-examine the party with reference thereto, the admission of this evidence over a party's objection will, in no event, require the grant of a new trial when that party had substantially the same evidence admitted without objection.

       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial on the ground that the state made improper arguments in closing because the challenged comments referred to evidence in the case, which was the defendant's refusal to submit to testing and other manifestations of impairment, and, thus, were not improper under O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       Trial court did not err by refusing to declare a mistrial after the prosecutor stated in the course of making an objection during the defense's closing argument that the state had never furnished the accomplice's custodial statement to another accomplice because the trial court properly noted at the time the statement was made that the jury had to consider the evidence adduced on that point, and the court had also previously instructed the jury that statements of counsel did not constitute evidence.

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the codefendant's motion for new trial because when viewed in the context in which it was made the prosecutor's argument referencing magic and misdirection and request that the jury focus on the evidence did not exceed the wide latitude permitted in closing argument.

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor misled the jury during closing argument because the trial court took action sufficient to prevent the prosecutor's misstatement from misleading the jury; the prosecutor immediately restated the principle of law using the proper language, and the trial court gave complete and correct instructions to the jury.

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err by denying the defendant's motion for mistrial based on the prosecutor's use of the term "confessed" during closing argument because the prosecutor's characterization of the defendant's statement to a detective was not an extraneous matter outside the facts legitimately produced during trial; the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence did not include opening and closing statements of the attorneys, and the defendant failed to show that the defendant was prejudiced or harmed by the prosecution's characterization of the statement.

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial on the ground that the state made improper statements to the jury during closing arguments because the state properly argued that the defendant did not rebut or explain the state's evidence; the trial court sustained the defendant's objections to the state's remarks and repeatedly instructed the jury that the burden of proof was upon the state and that the burden never shifted to the defendant.

       - Trial court did not err when the court denied the defendant's motion for new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct because the trial court determined that while there was prosecutorial misconduct since the county district attorney's office had access to the jail's telephone monitoring system without ensuring the blockage of inmate communications with their attorneys, the court also determined that the extent of misconduct was not sufficient to warrant granting a new trial to the defendant specifically; the prosecutor assured the defendant's trial counsel that no one working on the defendant's case had listened to any of appellant's telephone calls.

        <p>
       - Because the jurors testified at the motion for new trial hearing that deliberations did not begin before the close of the evidence, and even a dismissed juror, who allegedly communicated to trial counsel's paralegal that such had occurred, denied making such a statement, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on juror misconduct. Meeker v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">282 Ga. App. 77</cite>, <cite class="app_court">637 S.E.2d 806</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial because: (1) a mistrial based on an allegation of juror misconduct was unwarranted, given the lack of evidence that a dismissed juror impermissibly influenced other jurors by discussing a conversation that the dismissed juror had with the victim; and (2) the trial court dismissed the juror within minutes after the alleged inappropriate contact.

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by refusing to declare a mistrial on the ground that an alternate juror made improper comments about the defendant's guilt because the record disclosed no basis upon which to conclude that the misconduct was so prejudicial as to deny the defendant due process; the trial court thoroughly questioned each individual juror under oath about what he or she had heard and whether he or she had the ability to remain fair and impartial and found that each juror could remain impartial.

       - Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial as defense counsel did not give ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request a Jackson-Denno hearing as there was no basis to object to the introduction of defendant's statement to an investigator as: (1) the defendant was not under arrest at the time of the statement, nor would a reasonable person have understood that the person was under arrest; (2) there was no evidence that the officer sent to insure that the defendant did not leave the hospital before the investigator arrived had any contact with the defendant; (3) that the defendant was in pain or taking pain medication did not render defendant's statement involuntary; and (4) the defendant failed to show that the defendant was prejudiced by the failure to request the hearing.

Defendants' claim lacked credibility because at no point during the pre-trial motions hearing or trial did the defendants object or in any way indicate that the defendants could not understand the Spanish translation of the proceedings; during the sentencing hearing, all three defendants responded affirmatively when the trial court specifically asked each of the defendants, through the Spanish interpreter, if the defendants had understood their interpreters and everything the interpreters had explained to the defendants about the trial.

       - Trial court did not err in granting the defendant's motion for new trial based on the ground that the defendant's court-appointed interpreter inadequately translated the proceedings to the defendant because the trial judge made a factual finding that the defendant did not understand what was transpiring during the trial and that the lack of understanding prejudiced the defendant at trial.

       Because: (1) the record did not demonstrate that the defendant's sanity or competency was or should have been a significant issue at trial; and (2) the defendant failed to support an assertion that competency should have been raised, the defendant failed to prove the prejudice prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim due to counsel's failure to request an independent psychiatric examination. Thus, a new trial on this ground was unwarranted. Jennings v. State, <cite class="ga_court">282 Ga. 679</cite>, <cite class="app_court">653 S.E.2d 17</cite> (2007).

       - Trial court did not err in denying a former employee benefits plan administrator's motion for new trial on the ground that the jury verdict on the administrator's counterclaims were inconsistent because the verdict could be reasonably interpreted to mean that although the administrator did perform work on a client's behalf, the work had no value to the client; the client presented evidence that the administrator's software platform was of no value to the client, and there was evidence that the client had to expend funds to correct errors made by the administrator.

       After the juvenile court found that there was not probable cause to believe the child was dependent, the juvenile court erred in not conducting a hearing on the motion for new trial because the child's motion attacked the juvenile court's evidentiary findings, which was a proper claim of error in such a motion; furthermore, the child requested a hearing on the motion for new trial, and there was nothing in the record suggesting the child later waived the right to that hearing.

       - Trial court's grant of a defendant's motion for a mistrial over two months after a guilty verdict had been returned was void as a mistrial could not be entered after the verdict was returned; motions for mistrial were not to be confused with motions for a new trial, which were appropriate after the verdict was returned, and Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XVIII, provided for double jeopardy protection except when a new trial had been granted after the conviction or in the case of a mistrial. State v.

       - When defense counsel had approximately four months to prepare for the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial and during this time, counsel had access to the entire trial transcript and all matters of record filed with the superior court clerk's office, even though the defendant's counsel may not have had access to the transcripts of the pre-trial hearings, counsel did have ample time to consult with counsel's client, study the evidence presented at trial, and review all of defendant's written pre-trial motions, so the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion to continue.

        Within discretion of trial judge to set time for filing of transcript
       
       of evidence. There is nothing in the statute to indicate that the judge must state the judge's reasons for granting whatever length of time the judge determines is necessary for filing of transcript.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When it appears that transcript of evidence, or lawful substitute therefor is essential to consideration of grounds of motion for judgment n.o.v. or for new trial and neither was produced at time of hearing on motion, and judge found as a fact that movants had not made a reasonable effort to secure it, proper direction to give matter is to dismiss motion.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the defendants' motion for a new trial was dismissed not because the court reporter took longer than planned to prepare the transcript, but because the defendants failed to either seek and obtain an extension of time for filing the transcript or ensure the transcript was filed there was no abuse of discretion by the court. Myers v. Myers, <cite class="ga_app_court">195 Ga. App. 529</cite>, <cite class="app_court">394 S.E.2d 374</cite> (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court has discretion to set the time for filing of the transcript of the evidence, and dismissal of a motion for new trial is appropriate when the transcript is necessary to consideration of the motion, and the movant has made no reasonable effort to secure it. Moore v. Sinclair, <cite class="ga_app_court">196 Ga. App. 667</cite>, <cite class="app_court">396 S.E.2d 557</cite> (1990).

        Although there is a right to a hearing on a motion for new trial
       
       upon a timely request, the court is not required to hold a hearing on a motion for new trial which fails to show any merit and which is made more than 30 days after the entry of judgment. Wright v. Barnes, <cite class="ga_app_court">240 Ga. App. 684</cite>, <cite class="app_court">524 S.E.2d 758</cite> (1999).

        Strict pleading is required
       
       in extraordinary motions for new trial in order to postpone indefinitely the execution of the sentence and allow the judge to whom it is presented to ascertain readily if a new trial is warranted based on newly discovered evidence.

       - When the pleadings in an extraordinary motion for new trial in a criminal case do not contain a statement of facts sufficient to authorize that the motion be granted, if the facts developed at the hearing warrant such relief, it is not error for the trial court to refuse to conduct a hearing on the extraordinary motion.

       - When, at the close of the defendant's evidence, the court volunteered that in the court's opinion there was a fatal variance between the allegata and probata on the criminal trespass charge and that if the jury returned a verdict of guilty, the court would either "set that judgment aside" or "grant a motion for new trial instantly" if defendant requested one on that basis and, immediately following return of the verdicts, the court stated that it was granting "a new trial" on the criminal trespass charge, the court effectively acquitted the defendant.

       - Movant's extraordinary motion for a new trial based on recently discovered evidence must satisfy the court: (1) that newly discovered evidence has come to the movant's attention since the movant's trial; (2) that want of due diligence was not the reason that the movant's evidence was not acquired sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would produce probably a different verdict; (4) that the evidence was not cumulative only; (5) that the affidavit of the witness is attached to the motion or the affidavit's absence is sufficiently explained; and (6) that the new evidence does not operate solely to impeach the credit of a witness. The motion must set forth facts to meet these requirements; conclusions of counsel will not suffice. Dick v.

       - Petitioner, a death row inmate, argued in a federal habeas petition as a separate claim for relief that the petitioner was actually innocent, but that claim failed because actual innocence was not itself a constitutional claim, and was instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner had to pass to have the petitioner's otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits; further, the claim was not properly before the federal court as the inmate could pursue a claim of actual innocence in state court by filing an extraordinary motion for new trial under O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court's denial of defendant's new trial motion was proper because the defendant did not raise the issue of the trial counsel's ineffectiveness at the first available opportunity as defendant's filing of a notice of appeal divested the trial court of jurisdiction over such a motion and, moreover, the motion was untimely filed pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c05s5-5-40ol1a" target="_self">5-5-40(a)</a></cite>; there was no evidence that overcame the presumption of effective assistance of counsel pursuant to U.S. Const., amend. VI, as the defendant could not substantiate the allegations solely from the record and the defendant declined the opportunity to have counsel testify. Carter v.

       - Because the defendant's pro se motion for a new trial was filed within the time allotted for an out-of-time appeal, the fact that the defendant filed a pro se notice of appeal did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the motion for a new trial; thus, the denial of the motion, which contained a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel claim, was not a nullity for purposes of consideration by the court of appeals of the denial of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

       - Defendant's convictions for rape, incest, child molestation, and cruelty to children were proper because the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally barred.

       - Because the defendant was a fugitive when defense counsel filed the defendant's motion for a new trial, the defendant waived the defendant's right to seek such relief, even though the defendant was no longer a fugitive at the time the motion was dismissed; accordingly, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to reinstate the motion for a new trial.

       Motion for new trial made more than 30 days after entry of judgment
      
      is an extraordinary motion. Dyal v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">121 Ga. App. 50</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1970).

        Extraordinary motion for new trial is in nature of a bill in equity.

        Right to grant new trials upon extraordinary grounds was intended to replace bills in equity
       
       for new trials, and motion must state grounds upon which it is based. East Tenn. v. &amp; Ga. R.R. v. Whitlock, <cite class="ga_court">75 Ga. 77</cite> (1885); Cox v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">19 Ga. App. 283</cite>, <cite class="app_court">91 S.E. 422</cite> (1917).

       - Only superior and city courts may grant new trials, and court of ordinary (now probate court) has no jurisdiction to entertain motion or extraordinary motion for new trial. Byrd v. Riggs, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 473</cite>, <cite class="app_court">80 S.E.2d 785</cite> (1954).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c05s5-5-40" target="_self">5-5-40</a></cite>) could not be entertained unless some good reason be shown why motion was not made within time required, which reason shall be judged of by court.

       In any case when motion for new trial is made more than 30 days after entry of judgment on the verdict, some good reason must be shown why the motion was not made within time allowed by law.

        <p>
       Motions for new trial after verdict are not favored, and extraordinary motions for new trial after final judgment are favored even less. Williams v.

        Extraordinary motion for new trial institutes an entirely new case,
       
       requiring discretionary action on the part of the judge having jurisdiction thereof to bring the motion into actual existence as a cause in the courts. Bivins v. McDonald, <cite class="ga_app_court">50 Ga. App. 299</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E. 829</cite> (1934).

       - If plaintiff in error relies on so-called extraordinary motion for new trial as proper procedure to vacate and set aside existing judgments, the plaintiff is confronted with the rule that motion for new trial is not proper remedy to correct alleged error in any judgment or decree entered by the trial court and the plaintiff's motion will be denied.

        Strict pleading is required

        <p>
       - Trial court properly denied the inmate's pro se motion for DNA testing, which was filed 20 years after that inmate was convicted of aggravated sodomy and rape, as the identity of the perpetrator of the rape was not a significant issue in the case, and the inmate failed to satisfy all elements under O.C.G.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since the defendant's renewed request for DNA testing did not involve any new testing, it was not properly a request for DNA testing made pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Normally, the "good reason" necessary to permit the filing of an extraordinary motion for a new trial consists of newly discovered evidence, but the late filing of a motion for a new trial may also be predicated on circumstances other than newly discovered evidence. Martin v. Children's Sesame, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 242</cite>, <cite class="app_court">372 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1988).

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in concluding that the late filing of a motion was supported by "good reason" when the clerk's office incorrectly informed the movants of the filing date on two occasions and where the motion would have been timely had the clerk's representations been correct.

        <p>
       - Even though the defendant did not timely file a motion for a new trial because the defendant did not file such a motion within 30 days of the entry of conviction and the imposition of sentence, the state supreme court had jurisdiction to hear the defendant's appeal as the trial court granted permission to the defendant to file an out-of-time motion for a new trial and denied that motion on the motion's merits following a hearing, and, thus, the defendant was entitled to file a direct appeal to the appropriate reviewing court.

       - When the plaintiff filed an extraordinary motion for new trial, which the trial court denied, appellate jurisdiction existed; although no ruling on the motion was contained in the record on appeal or requested in the notice of appeal, the trial court implicitly granted permission to file the motion by expressly recognizing the plaintiff's pleading as both a request to file an out-of-time motion for new trial and as a motion for new trial, by holding an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the motion for new trial, and by denying the motion for new trial on the motion's merits.

       After one accused of a crime has been convicted, and has made a motion for new trial, and judgment denying the motion has been affirmed by the Supreme Court, when extraordinary motion for new trial is made, based on the ground of newly discovered evidence, it should be made to appear that such evidence is so material that it would probably produce a different verdict.

       - In order for extraordinary motion for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence to be a valid motion, it must appear that newly discovered evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, and that it would likely produce a different result. None of these requirements can be determined without examination of evidence adduced upon original trial of case. Absent either transcript or brief of evidence adduced at original trial, court cannot make determination it is required to make by referring to only part of evidence. Dyal v.

        <p>
       - A movant's extraordinary motion for a new trial based on recently discovered evidence must satisfy the court: (1) that newly discovered evidence has come to the movant's attention since his trial; (2) that want of due diligence was not the reason that his evidence was not acquired sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would produce probably a different verdict; (4) that it was not cumulative only; (5) that the affidavit of the witness is attached to the motion or its absence is sufficiently explained; and (6) that the new evidence does not operate solely to impeach the credit of a witness. The motion must set forth facts to meet these requirements; conclusions of counsel will not suffice. Dick v.

       - Petitioner, a death row inmate, argued in a federal habeas petition as a separate claim for relief that the petitioner was actually innocent, but that claim failed because actual innocence was not itself a constitutional claim, and was instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner had to pass to have the petitioner's otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits; further, the claim was not properly before the federal court, as the inmate could pursue a claim of actual innocence in state court by filing an extraordinary motion for new trial under O.C.G.A.

       - When denial of motion for new trial is affirmed, either on merits or from lack of jurisdiction due to failure to file within time allowed by statute for review, extraordinary motion for new trial will not lie to review any grounds in original motion even though some such grounds may be meritorious. King v. State, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 432</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E. 168</cite> (1932).

       - Sufficiency of the evidence is not a sufficiently good reason to grant an extraordinary motion for new trial. Franz v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">208 Ga. App. 677</cite>, <cite class="app_court">432 S.E.2d 554</cite> (1993).

        No special circumstances were present justifying an extraordinary motion
       
       for a new trial based on proffered testimony of defendant's codefendant who had invoked the codefendant's Fifth Amendment right not to testify at the prior trial and who had pled guilty and been sentenced in the interim because the substance of the testimony was not in fact new evidence since it was always known by the defendant, and the witness lacked credibility since the witness had nothing to lose by testifying untruthfully regarding the alleged innocence of the defendant. Hester v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">219 Ga. App. 256</cite>, <cite class="app_court">465 S.E.2d 288</cite> (1995).

        <p>
       - Defendant's pleading, which sought an out-of-time appeal under circumstances where such an appeal was not permitted, could not be considered an extraordinary motion for new trial since the defendant had already filed such a motion in 1992 and was statutorily limited to filing one such motion under O.C.G.A.

       Death of presiding judge before motion is heard

However, language used in overruling motion will be scrutinized to determine if successor shows that judge, in overruling the motion, did not exercise any discretion in reviewing the verdict.

       First sentence of statute changed common law rule,

       When there is no service of process or waiver thereof, court is without jurisdiction
      
      and the court's judgment is void, not merely voidable, and may be attacked in any court where such judgment is attempted to be enforced. Dunn v. Dunn, <cite class="ga_court">221 Ga. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">144 S.E.2d 758</cite> (1965).

       - It is essential for validity of motion that the motion be filed in the clerk's office and until the motion is so filed the motion is a mere private paper. Acknowledgment of service of such private paper, purporting to be a motion for new trial, is a mere nullity, and service as required by statute is not perfected. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v.

       - When rule nisi granted upon application for new trial, or in any order passed continuing hearing upon motion for new trial, there is no limitation of period within which service of rule nisi or other order should be perfected, such service as will give opposite party a reasonable opportunity to prepare for hearing upon motion for new trial and to resist the hearing is sufficient service.

       <p>
        <p>
       While no specific time is prescribed by statute within which respondent shall be served with copy of rule nisi issued upon application for new trial, it has been held that service must be had a reasonable time before hearing, and that such service is essential unless waived.

On the date fixed for the hearing the trial judge granted an order postponing the hearing to a later date, making no other order as to service. The motion for a new trial was not served five days before the date fixed for the first hearing, but it was duly served five days prior to the date as fixed for the subsequent order of postponement.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Waiver of service results when opposite party appears to argue motion. Baldwin v. Daniel, <cite class="ga_court">69 Ga. 782</cite> (1883); Hopkins v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">147 Ga. 821</cite>, <cite class="app_court">95 S.E. 675</cite> (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When rule nisi, issued upon filing of motion for new trial, was not served on respondent, and service was not expressly waived, but agreement was made in open court by counsel for respondent, to passage of order setting hearing upon motion at designated time and place, which agreement was recited in order, and counsel for respondent afterwards appeared at time and place set for hearing on motion, these facts amount to waiver by respondent, through counsel, of service of rule nisi. Beeland v. Butler-Payne Lumber Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 603</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E. 303</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Waiver does not result by informing movant's counsel that certain day is suitable to respondent.
       
       Smedley v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">112 Ga. 114</cite>, <cite class="app_court">37 S.E. 111</cite> (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Acknowledgment of service of order merely continuing hearing of motion to another date
       
       is insufficient to dispense with service of copy of rule nisi. Thornton v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">16 Ga. App. 210</cite>, <cite class="app_court">84 S.E. 973</cite> (1915).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When time fixed for hearing arrives, and no service has been effected, it is generally a matter in sound discretion of trial judge whether to dismiss motion or to continue final hearing until service is perfected. Webb v. Nobles, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 287</cite>, <cite class="app_court">24 S.E.2d 27</cite> (1943); Trammell v. Throgmorton, <cite class="ga_court">210 Ga. 659</cite>, <cite class="app_court">82 S.E.2d 140</cite> (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Judgment dismissing motion for new trial, on motion of respondent made at time set for hearing, is not an abuse of trial court's discretion when there has been no personal service on respondent or any waiver of such service. Braziel v. Hunter, <cite class="ga_app_court">103 Ga. App. 854</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 39</cite> (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When there was neither service nor written waiver of service upon opposite party of rule nisi issued in connection with motion for new trial, and when, at first opportunity and before either expressly or impliedly consented to completion of motion or judicial consideration upon the motion's merits, the respondent moved to dismiss the proceeding for want of such service, court did not err in dismissing the motion. Jackson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">24 Ga. App. 594</cite>, <cite class="app_court">101 S.E. 710</cite> (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Dismissal is proper when service is not proved.
       
       Strickland v. Bell, <cite class="ga_court">144 Ga. 494</cite>, <cite class="app_court">87 S.E. 398</cite> (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Failure to attach rule nisi to motion for new trial does not demand dismissal
       
       of motion. Trial judge in the judge's discretion may dismiss the motion or continue matter until motion is perfected. Stoner v. McDougall, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 171</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 138</cite> (1975); Craig v. Holsey, <cite class="ga_app_court">264 Ga.

       - When the defendant files a motion for new trial, but no rule nisi is attached nor copy of the rule nisi served upon the state, nor does the state waive this requirement, there is no abuse of discretion by the trial court in dismissing the defendant's motion for new trial.

       - Proper construction of statute is not that it takes away discretion of trial judge in matter of granting bail after conviction, but that it authorizes trial judge, in the judge's discretion, to admit the defendant to bail pending disposition of the motion for new trial. Ingram v. Grimes, <cite class="ga_court">213 Ga. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">100 S.E.2d 914</cite> (1957), for comment, see 21 Ga. B.J. 235 (1958).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Testimony, by reason of rendition at one trial, does not operate as admission in judicio which would as a matter of law preclude recovery upon subsequent trial. Scott v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Even when a new trial has been granted on ground that, under testimony of plaintiff personally, plaintiff was as a matter of law not entitled to recover, case stands on docket for trial as though no trial had been had and it is error for court, on call of case for second trial, to dismiss the case upon motion of the defendant, on ground that testimony of the plaintiff as adduced on former trial of case operated to preclude recovery by the plaintiff. Cook v. Attapulgus Clay Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 610</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 334</cite> (1936).

        <p>
       Although testimony of party to case may as a matter of law preclude recovery in the party's favor, it does so only as respects trial at which testimony is rendered and is not grounds for dismissal of new trial, because after new trial has been granted, case stands in posture of de novo proceeding as though no trial had been had.

        <p>
       - Party to case who has testified on former trial of that case may, upon subsequent trial of same case, give testimony in contradiction of that party's testimony given upon former trial, and, when so testifying, that party's testimony upon former trial is, when introduced in evidence on subsequent trial, in nature of an extrajudicial admission or impeaching testimony, whose probative value is for the jury.

        <p>
       While party's testimony at first trial may have been different from the party's testimony at the second trial, and may be introduced as an admission or impeaching testimony, it will be for the jury to determine the testimony's probative value.

       - Notwithstanding plaintiff in error in first trial made written request for charge on law of undue influence, nevertheless upon second trial it was error for trial judge to charge on that subject when there was no evidence to authorize charge on undue influence.

        <p>
       - If trial court does not acquire jurisdiction by filing of remittitur in clerk's office, the court is without authority to take any steps in the case, and has no more right to pass order formally making judgment of the Supreme Court its judgment than the Supreme Court had, without so doing, to proceed with trial.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Unless filing of remittitur in office of trial court operates to restore at once to that court the court's former jurisdiction over cases, they ought not to be redocketed when remittitur is so filed, and requirement that they immediately be redocketed when remittitur is entered conclusively shows that it was intention of the legislature that trial court's jurisdiction over cases should be restored when mandate of reviewing court reached it through prescribed procedure.

       - Statute cannot possibly mean that remittitur must be made judgment of trial court and spread upon the court's minutes before the clerk of that court proceeds to redocket cases. On the contrary, it contemplates that cases shall be immediately entered upon docket of the trial court, in order that judge, on reaching cases in the cases' regular order, can dispose of the cases by carrying into effect the judgment rendered by reviewing court.

       - When on return of remittitur in case in which there was judgment of reversal but not express direction of Supreme Court to lower court, the case stands as reversed, and a new trial must be had on issues therein raised since the case illegally terminated.

       - When error assigned on overruling of demurrer (now motion to dismiss), refusal to grant nonsuit, and overruling motion for new trial, judgment of reversal will not put case out of court as on nonsuit.

       - Because a landlord chose not to move to dismiss a tenant's counterclaim at the first bench trial on the specific ground that the tenant failed to prove the amount of damages for its attorney-fees counterclaim, the tenant was not alerted to the need to reopen the tenant's case to cure the problem, and the landlord's decision meant that following reversal and remand, the trial court was required to allow the tenant to prove those fees at a second trial.

       - Reviewable judgment does not become final, however, until time prescribed by law for appealing the judgment has passed, or if appealed, until such judgment is affirmed by the appellate court and judgment of the appellate court is made the judgment of the trial court. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Whitman, <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 375</cite>, <cite class="app_court">130 S.E.2d 272</cite> (1963).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Discretion to grant or refuse motions for new trials because a verdict is strongly and decidedly against the weight of the evidence rests solely in the presiding judge, and while the appellate division of the Municipal Court of Atlanta may, as any other court of review, grant a new trial when there is no evidence to support the verdict, when there was some evidence on which the verdict could be based, and such verdict had the approval of the trial judge, the appellate division of the Municipal Court of Atlanta erred in granting a new trial. Turner v. Masonic Relief Ass'n, <cite class="ga_app_court">52 Ga. App. 374</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E. 350</cite> (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Appellate courts will not interfere with first grant of new trial when there is any evidence at all upon which different verdict could be sustained. Maloy v. Planter's Whse. &amp; Lumber Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">142 Ga. App. 69</cite>, <cite class="app_court">234 S.E.2d 807</cite> (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        After one grant of new trial, subsequent grant upon discretionary grounds will be closely examined
       
       to see that discretion of court below has been justly and wisely exercised, in view of the facts of the particular case, and with due regard to general consideration of fitness of juries to ascertain facts and of necessity that there must be some end to the litigation. Smith v. State Mut. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">45 Ga. App. 633</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E. 896</cite> (1932).

        When law and facts of the case do not demand verdict for either party,

       - Grant of a new trial was affirmed because the successor judge thoroughly reviewed the case, and presided over a full hearing in the matter. The judge made independent evaluations not only about the defendant's involvement in the crimes but about the culpability of the codefendants, and concluded, that the defendant got "caught up" in the "neighborhood feud" and was "just a peripheral figure."

       - Although the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the defendant's conviction, the trial court did not err in exercising the court's discretion to grant a new trial under the general grounds as the case rested entirely upon the credibility of the defendant, the victim, and the witnesses, and the appellate court was constrained by existing precedent to conclude that the trial court did not abuse the court's broad discretion in granting the defendant's new trial on the general grounds.

       - First grant of new trial will not be reversed unless it plainly and manifestly appears that there was an abuse of discretion by court below, and court will not closely scrutinize facts in evidence or endeavor to balance with great exactness the testimony on both sides, with view to detecting abuse of discretion by the trial judge.

       - Scope within which discretion may be exercised, in consideration of evidence, by judge who did not preside at trial is not as extensive as in case of judge who heard and observed witnesses, and who, in a sense, is to be considered as thirteenth member of jury.

       After the defendant was found guilty of felony murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting death of the defendant's ex-husband, the trial court properly exercised the court's discretion to grant the defendant a new trial on the general grounds because the court concluded that the jury's guilty verdicts were decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence and contrary to the principles of justice and equity; and the supreme court would not disturb the first grant of a new trial based on the general grounds unless the trial court abused the court's discretion in granting it and the law and the facts demanded the verdict rendered.

    In the absence of legal error, an appellate court is without jurisdiction to interfere with a verdict supported by some evidence, even when the verdict may be against the preponderance of the evidence.

       - Damages are given not only as penalty upon plaintiff in error, but also as compensation for delay, cost, and vexation occasioned thereby to the defendant in error. Hardy v. Truitt, <cite class="ga_app_court">20 Ga. App. 529</cite>, <cite class="app_court">93 S.E. 149</cite> (1917).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When courts are used to evade judgments, especially when effort is made on frivolous grounds, after full opportunity has been had for fair adjudication, this statute in nature of penalty is properly invoked. Felker v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 797</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 668</cite> (1940).

         Justice demands damages award when appeal is obviously frivolous.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When record discloses that the plaintiff in error has no just case, that no new question of law is involved, and the record is full of those things which every judge and every lawyer recognizes as indicia of an attempt to fight merely for time, justice demands that the court overcome any personal hesitancy the court may have, and that it add an award of damages to the judgment of affirmance. Prattes v. Southeast Ceramics, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">132 Ga. App. 584</cite>, <cite class="app_court">208 S.E.2d 600</cite> (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        When motion for 10 percent damages is filed, court shall carefully examine record,
       
       and pass upon motion in light of entire history of the case as there presented. Prattes v. Southeast Ceramics, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">132 Ga. App. 584</cite>, <cite class="app_court">208 S.E.2d 600</cite> (1974).

       <p>

       Unless there is judgment for sum certain,
      
      court cannot award damages under this statute. Collins P. &amp; B.R.R. v. Short Elec. Ry., <cite class="ga_court">95 Ga. 570</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E. 495</cite> (1894); Berryman v.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Unless judgment for sum certain has been rendered in trial court, the Supreme Court has no authority under this statute to award damages in favor of the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error, although it might be the opinion of court that the cause was taken up for delay only. Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="ga_court">178 Ga. 203</cite>, <cite class="app_court">172 S.E. 459</cite> (1934).

      Motion to assess damages under statute because appeal was for delay, will be denied when appeal is not from judgment for sum certain. Shepherd v. Epps, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 322</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 33</cite> (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Even though an appeal is taken for delay only, when the judgment is not for a sum certain, a motion for ten percent damages must be denied. Fawcett v. Fawcett Contracting, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">252 Ga. 242</cite>, <cite class="app_court">312 S.E.2d 790</cite> (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      An award of damages for frivolous appeal was not an available remedy since where there had been no award of money damages in the case sub judice. Young v. First Am. Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">196 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">396 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1990).

        <p>
       When none of the appellant's enumerations of error are meritorious, but neither are the enumerations so specious as to warrant the conclusion that the appeal is taken for the purpose of delay only, a motion for damages for a frivolous appeal is denied.

       - While assignments of error made are insufficient to bring about reversal, nevertheless counsel for the losing party has an absolute right to test the legality of the judgment, and the very fact that part of the charge on which the error was assigned was shown to have been inexact and perhaps even error, though harmless, afforded a reasonable ground for testing the judgment.

       One great purpose in establishing Supreme Court (or Court of Appeals)
      
      was to terminate suits, and with this view, it is made its duty not only to grant judgments of affirmance or reversal, but any other order, direction or decree required, and if necessary to make final disposition of cause, and it is empowered to give to cause in court below such direction as may be consistent with law and justice of case. Gray v. Watson, <cite class="ga_app_court">54 Ga. App. 885</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 616</cite> (1936).

       Filing of remittitur merely annuls and vacates orders which have been reversed,
      
      leaving examiner's report standing as before, and restoring exceptions to their original status - neither sustained nor overruled, but ripe for disposition according to law. Holton v. Lankford, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 506</cite>, <cite class="app_court">6 S.E.2d 304</cite> (1939).

       - Filing of a remittitur in the office of the clerk of a trial court immediately reinvests the court with jurisdiction for all purposes over the case to which such remittitur relates, though good practice requires that the trial court cause the remittitur to be entered upon the trial court's minutes.

       - When judgment was entered for the plaintiff, who then filed a notice of appeal, and the defendant then filed a cross appeal as well as a motion for new trial in the trial court, and the Court of Appeals then affirmed the trial court's judgment, the trial court could not reassert the trial court's jurisdiction and grant a new trial to the defendant. The fact that the case made its way through the appeal processes of the Court of Appeals effectively cut off the defendant's right to pursue the defendant's motion for a new trial. Thus, the proper means of placing this issue before the appellate court would be to file a motion for a stay of the direct appeal with the Court of Appeals, and if the stay is denied, then to petition for writ of certiorari.

      Judgment of reversal, without more, operates only to vacate orders and decree as therein stated, and to reinvest trial court with jurisdiction, on filing of remittitur in office of clerk of trial court.

       Effect of reversal by Supreme Court

       - Appellate practice rules were adopted by the General Assembly for the primary purpose of securing speedy and uniform justice in a uniform and well ordered manner; the rules were not adopted to set traps and pitfalls, by way of technicalities, for unwary litigants. Chambliss v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 96</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E.2d 334</cite> (1966).

       - Pleadings and procedure shall be liberally construed so as to bring about a decision on the merits. Grantham v. State, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 775</cite>, <cite class="app_court">262 S.E.2d 777</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the plaintiff failed to file enumerations of error as a separate document, but did set forth enumerations of error in the plaintiff's brief, it was apparent from the notice of appeal, the brief, the enumerations of error in that brief, and the record, exactly what judgment was appealed from and what errors were asserted, and a liberal construction of the appellate practice act required the court to exercise the court's discretion to reach the merits of the case. Leslie v. Williams, <cite class="ga_app_court">235 Ga. App. 657</cite>, <cite class="app_court">510 S.E.2d 130</cite> (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the plaintiffs presented an enumeration of error in the plaintiff's appellate brief and it was apparent from that brief, the notice of appeal and the record what judgment was being appealed from and what error was being asserted, the appellate court considered the merits of the appeal to the extent the appeal was supported by argument, citation to the record, and authority. Reeder v. GMAC, <cite class="ga_app_court">235 Ga. App. 617</cite>, <cite class="app_court">510 S.E.2d 337</cite> (1998).
       </p>
       <p>

       Although plaintiff's delay in following up on the transmission of the record was unreasonable and inexcusable, the language of this section and O.C.G.A.

       Despite the deficiencies in the appellant's brief, which made it difficult for the court of appeals to determine what the case was even about, much less allow the court to perform any meaningful analysis of the asserted errors, given that the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A.

       Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider enumerations of error arising from breach of contract claim, since the jury's verdict on the claim was never reduced to judgment because of the plaintiff's election to have judgment entered on the plaintiff's theory of fraud. Miner v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_app_court">205 Ga. App. 523</cite>, <cite class="app_court">422 S.E.2d 899</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">205 Ga.

       - O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-31" target="_self">5-6-31</a></cite> plainly provides that the filing with the clerk of a judgment, signed by the judge, constitutes the entry of a judgment within the meaning of the Appellate Practice Act, and as a result the 30-day limit under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-38ol1a" target="_self">5-6-38(a)</a></cite> for filing a notice of appeal does not begin to run until a judgment, signed by the judge, is filed with the clerk; to the extent that Ross v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">259 Ga. App. 246</cite> (2003) holds otherwise, it is hereby overruled. Rocha v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-30" target="_self">5-6-30</a></cite> et seq., the well established rule that what the judge orally declares is no judgment until put into writing and entered as such, is still of force, and both written judgment and the judgment's entry by filing writing with clerk are essential prerequisites to appeal. Boynton v. Reeves, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 202</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E.2d 702</cite> (1970).

        <p>
       - Although directed verdict is normally issued ore tenus, it becomes reduced to writing by virtue of its recitation in the verdict which is signed by the judge and therefore is reviewable as a final judgment. Crowe v. Holloway Dev. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">114 Ga. App. 856</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E.2d 913</cite> (1966).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Oral order is not final nor appealable until and unless the order is reduced to writing, signed by the judge, and filed with the clerk. This constitutes "entry;" and it is only an "entered" decision or judgment which is appealable. Sharp v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga. App. 641</cite>, <cite class="app_court">360 S.E.2d 50</cite> (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because the notice of appeal was from an unappealable oral order, the appeal was dismissed and the appellant's motion to remand was, therefore, moot. In the Interest of W.P.B., <cite class="ga_app_court">269 Ga. App. 101</cite>, <cite class="app_court">603 S.E.2d 454</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       To the extent that a later contempt finding was based on the trial court's oral pronouncement, it was a nullity. In re Tidwell, <cite class="ga_app_court">279 Ga. App. 734</cite>, <cite class="app_court">632 S.E.2d 690</cite> (2006).

Rocha v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">287 Ga. App. 446</cite>, <cite class="app_court">651 S.E.2d 781</cite> (2007).
       </p>

       While a nunc pro tunc entry does not extend the statutory period for filing a notice of appeal, case law does not stand for the proposition that a nunc pro tunc entry can shorten the statutory period for filing a notice of appeal provided in O.C.G.A.

The General Assembly further finds that supporting Georgia's children is vitally important to the citizens of Georgia. Therefore, the General Assembly has determined that it is in the best interests of the state and its citizenry to undertake an evaluation of the child support guidelines on a continuing basis. The General Assembly declares that it is important that all of Georgia's children are provided with adequate financial support whether the children's parents are living together or not living together. The General Assembly finds that both parents have a continuing obligation with respect to providing financial and emotional stability for their child or children.

       Ga. L. 2006, p. 379,
   §
   1/HB 1059, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that:
   "The General Assembly finds and declares that recidivist sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Many sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and some sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The General Assembly finds that this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. The General Assembly further finds that the high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) Incarcerating sexual offenders and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) Requiring the registration of sexual offenders, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual offenders;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) Collecting data relative to sexual offenses and sexual offenders;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5) Requiring sexual predators who are released into the community to wear an electronic monitoring system for the rest of their natural life and to pay for such system; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6) Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The General Assembly further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual offenders and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual offenders to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual offenders. The General Assembly declares that in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual offenders be registered and that members of the community and the public be notified of a sexual offender's presence. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes. Likewise, the designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from findings by the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board and a court if requested by a sexual offender."

       There can be no effective appeal from anything but a judgment;
      
      a final judgment without a certificate, or an interlocutory judgment with a certificate, reduced to writing and entered by filing with the clerk. G.M.J. v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">130 Ga. App. 420</cite>, <cite class="app_court">203 S.E.2d 608</cite> (1973).

       <p>
      When the appellate court assumed, without deciding, that a pending commercial lease controversy authorized a declaratory judgment directing the defendant would not be in breach of the lease by paying future rent according to an amendment, it held that, because a controversy remained pending below, the order granting that declaration was not a final judgment, and therefore that portion of the order granting declaratory judgment was not directly appealable, and the denial of the defendant's motion for summary judgment was also not independently directly appealable. Yeazel v. Burger King Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">236 Ga. App. 110</cite>, <cite class="app_court">511 S.E.2d 237</cite> (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In a legal malpractice action, the appeals court held that the appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear a lawyer's appeal from the trial court's order striking an untimely response to a motion for summary judgment, as: (1) no final judgment had been entered against the lawyer, who remained a defendant in the trial court; and (2) the lawyer failed to follow the procedures for appealing the interlocutory ruling on the motion to strike.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Appeal from the probate court to a superior court is for the purpose of conducting a de novo investigation in the superior court, and not for the purpose of correcting errors of law committed in the probate court. Thus, there can be no direct appeal to the superior court from an interlocutory ruling in the probate court. Driver v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">198 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">402 S.E.2d 524</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">198 Ga. App. 897</cite>, <cite class="app_court">402 S.E.2d 524</cite> (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When an order appealed from was for a partial accounting, and thus not directly appealable, it was interlocutory; thus, as claims remained below, when the appealing parties failed to follow the interlocutory appeal procedures, dismissal was warranted.

       - Decision is not an appealable judgment when (1) case is still pending in court below; (2) record contains no certificate of trial judge certifying that decision appealed from is of such importance to case that immediate review should be had; and (3) decision is not one of those specifically described judgments from which appeal is permitted by subsection (a) of this section.

       Appeals court rejected an employee's claim that because the trial court had previously signed a certificate of immediate review of the trial court's original order denying summary judgment on the employee's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case at the time the trial court amended the order by granting summary judgment in favor of the former employer and the former manager; as the trial court's order was not appealable, the trial court retained jurisdiction and thus was authorized to amend the court's order.

       When the mother and the father, who were the biological parents of their incapacitated adult daughter, were seeking appointment as the daughter's guardian and conservator, the appellate court found that the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the mother's and the stepfather's appeals of the superior court's December 21, 2015, show cause order requiring the mother and stepfather to appear in court with the daughter because that order did not include any decision as to custody, nor did the court hold or decline to hold any party in contempt of a child custody or any other order; thus, it was an interlocutory ruling and not directly appealable.

       When there is only an appeal from a jury verdict, and no description of an appealable judgment or order, there is nothing to review, and the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction since it is a court for corrections of errors of law alone.

        <p>
       - Order adjudging one in contempt means trial court has passed upon merits of cases and the order, in effect, is a final disposition of the contempt matter by that court, whether it involves an interlocutory order or a final judgment. Ramsey v. Ramsey, <cite class="ga_court">231 Ga. 334</cite>, <cite class="app_court">201 S.E.2d 429</cite> (1973).

       When individual is adjudged in contempt, trial court is done with the matter and to require an application for discharge, as a condition precedent to appeal, is usually a futile and empty gesture.

        Direct appeals may be taken from contempt orders

        Only pending issue to be resolved by the trial court was whether the defendant should be held in contempt for failing to comply with the directives of the default judgment; thus, once the trial court denied the plaintiff's motion for contempt, there were no further issues to resolve in the case, and the plaintiff had no further recourse in the court below so the trial court's order was final and subject to direct appeal.

       - Although a petition for a writ of prohibition was a separate civil proceeding which allowed for a final and appealable ruling regarding it, the determination of whether the state had a right to appeal a ruling was determined by the underlying subject matter, not the relief sought, and since the state was not statutorily authorized to appeal the denial of its objection to the defendant's waiver of a jury trial in a criminal case, and the denial of its petition for writ of prohibition seeking to compel a jury trial, the state supreme court had to dismiss the state's appeal of the denial of its writ of prohibition since the state supreme court did not have jurisdiction to reverse the ruling after the writ had been denied and statutory law did not permit the state to appeal that ruling.

       When attorneys for a defendant in a capital case served a subpoena regarding the funding of indigent services on the Executive Director of the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council, the Council's appeal from the denial of Council's motion to quash was directly appealable under the collateral order doctrine. It involved matters that were unrelated to the basic issues to be decided in the criminal case; an appeal would conclusively resolve the discovery issue; and the important rights of a number of indigent capital defendants would be compromised if the Council had to await final judgment before seeking review.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-34" target="_self">5-6-34</a></cite>). The second method was where the trial judge entered an order upon express determination that there were no just reasons of delay and upon express direction for entry of judgment under provision of Ga. L. 1966, p. 609,
   §
   54 (see O.C.G.A.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.09.html#t09c11s9-11-54ol1b" target="_blank">9-11-54(b)</a></cite>). When second method was used, the appellate court must still determine whether the judgment rendered met the requirements of finality contained in former Code 1933,
   §
   6-701. J.C. Penney Co. v. Malouf Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 832</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E.2d 453</cite> (1972), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 140</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E.2d 145</cite> (1973).

        Orders entered subsequent to the filing of a notice of appeal

   An enumeration of error which addresses the subsequent grant of summary judgment on the issue of damages is not predicated upon a timely filed notice of appeal from that order or from any other appealable order which encompasses that subsequent ruling.

       - When uniform traffic citation and complaint form was used to charge an offense in a constitutional city court, but the solicitor (now prosecuting attorney) subsequently amended the form to allege a violation of a city ordinance, jurisdiction of an appeal lay in the superior court rather than the Court of Appeals.

       - Citizens' appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the trial court's orders denying the citizens interlocutory injunctive relief and authorizing a city and development authority to transfer disputed tax funds to a school system were not subject to direct appeal; the trial court's order authorizing the city and development authority to transfer disputed tax funds to the school system for the school's general purposes was an amendment of the trial court's order granting an interlocutory injunction and was a finding by the trial court that a final order in the appellants' favor was unlikely, and the order denying the citizens an interlocutory injunction was not a ruling on an issue raised in the parties' cross-motions for partial summary judgment, which remained pending in the trial court.

       - Trial court erred in dismissing an employee's notice of appeal challenging the grant of an employer's emergency motion because the trial court's order on the emergency motion was directly appealable, and, therefore, the order dismissing the notice of appeal from the order on the emergency motion was, itself, directly appealable under O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - When the trial judge, after rendering the order, departs from the jurisdiction so as to make it impossible to request of the judge a timely certificate for immediate appellate review, request, if timely, may be presented for grant or denial to another judge of same court having authority to hear emergency matters. Tingle v. Harvill, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 312</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E.2d 536</cite> (1972); Freemon v. Dubroca, <cite class="ga_app_court">177 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Certificate of appealability is not itself a judgment in the cause,
       
       but is simply an order allowing judgment or order already entered to be appealed and reviewed. G.M.J. v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">130 Ga. App. 420</cite>, <cite class="app_court">203 S.E.2d 608</cite> (1973).

        <p>

        Certificate of immediate review to interlocutory order must be followed by petition to appellate court.

       When a party does not file an application for interlocutory appeal within ten days of the granting of the trial court's certificate for immediate review, the appeal is premature and must be dismissed.

       - In an action on a credit card contract brought by a creditor, the debtor's voluntary dismissal of an appeal from an order granting the creditor summary judgment before the case was ever docketed served to dismiss the debtor's direct appeal, even though the trial court did not enter a formal dismissal order; thus, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, and a payment of appeal costs became moot.

Ct. App. R. 1(a) and Ga. Ct.

       While the failure to move for a directed verdict barred a party from contending on appeal that the party was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law because of insufficient evidence, such did not bar the party from contending their entitlement to a new trial on that ground, as fairness dictated that a party who has failed to move for a directed verdict at trial should not be able to obtain a judgment as a matter of law on appeal based on the contention the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.

        Clear intent of paragraph (a)(1)
       
       is to give appellate courts (particularly Court of Appeals which has jurisdiction of workers' compensation cases not involving constitutionality of a law) discretion not to entertain an appeal when the superior court has reviewed a decision of certain specified lower tribunals (i.e., two tribunals had already adjudicated the case). Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Rayle, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 727</cite>, <cite class="app_court">273 S.E.2d 139</cite> (1980).

       Because the order granting a defense motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiff's motion to withdraw admissions was subject to direct appeal and the plaintiff had initiated the plaintiff's appeal by filing an otherwise timely discretionary application, the appellate court granted the application; furthermore, because the order granting the application was issued on August 1, 2017, and directed the plaintiff to file a notice of appeal within 10 days, but the plaintiff had already filed a notice of appeal on July 13, 2017, the plaintiff's amended notice of appeal was unnecessary as the prematurely filed July 13 notice ripened into a timely notice of appeal upon the appellate court's granting of the discretionary application.

       - Trial court erred in ruling that a husband was not obligated for temporary alimony amounts that had come due before the entry of remittitur in the trial court, but the court correctly ruled that as to child support, the temporary award remained in effect until the date the remittitur was entered because a temporary award continued in effect until the entry of the remittitur in the trial court, and it was from that date forward that any permanent award in a final judgment and decree of divorce had effect.

       Trial court erred in revoking the defendant's probation on a basis that was not alleged in the state's revocation petition as the state's petition to revoke sought to do so on the ground that the defendant committed a new offense of misdemeanor stalking, but the trial court's order provided that it was revoking probation on the ground that the defendant committed a new felony offense, presumably the offense of aggravated stalking mentioned by the state during the revocation hearing.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When following the revocation of the appellant's probation, the appellant filed a "Petition for Appeal" with the trial court, which the trial court dismissed, following which the appellant filed an "Out-of-Date Appeal" to the court of appeals, as no application was filed directly in time, the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Scriven v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga. App. 513</cite>, <cite class="app_court">346 S.E.2d 906</cite> (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Appeal by the state from the grant of probationer's motion to suppress was dismissed since a revocation of probation hearing is not a criminal proceeding for purposes of a direct appeal; jurisdiction would lie upon application only. State v. Wilbanks, <cite class="ga_app_court">215 Ga. App. 223</cite>, <cite class="app_court">450 S.E.2d 293</cite> (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's filing of an application for discretionary appeal from a revocation of probation acted as a supersedeas to the same extent as a notice of appeal and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to enter an amended revocation order. Bryson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">228 Ga. App. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">491 S.E.2d 184</cite> (1997).

       <p>
        <p>
       Statute applied when the appellant challenged the sentence imposed upon the revocation of the appellant's probation, but did not challenge the revocation itself, since the underlying subject matter of the appeal was still the revocation of probation and, therefore, the appellant was required to apply for a discretionary appeal.

       Appellate court properly dismissed an attorney's direct appeal in a case wherein the attorney sued a client for attorney fees because the judgment the attorney recovered was one for damages in an amount under $10,000, and as such, the judgment was subject to appeal as a matter of discretion under O.C.G.A.

         Challenge to zoning ordinance change not subject to discretionary appeal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        - Landfill company's direct appeal was properly before the appellate court because the case was not a zoning case that required an application for discretionary appeal as it was challenging a change in the ordinance overall, which was an exercise of legislative power and not an adjudicative decision of an administrative agency, as opposed to appealing a land use decision specific to it. Sweet City Landfill, LLC v. Elbert County,
   Ga. App.
   ,
   S.E.2d
   (Aug. 28, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by dismissing a landfill company's action as moot because its challenge to the zoning ordinance changes made by the county involved a situation wherein there was no likelihood that the prior ordinances would be reinstated if the suit was terminated; thus, in the absence of evidence indicating that the county intended to return to the prior ordinances, the landfill company's legal challenge to it was moot.

   Ga. App.

       - Petitioner's case was remanded to the habeas court for it to consider the motion to set aside in a manner that takes into account the affidavit of habeas counsel in the context of all the circumstances of the case because the habeas court did not make a finding as to whether habeas counsel received notice of the final habeas hearing based on a consideration of the affidavit of habeas counsel, thus, the habeas court's analysis was incomplete.

       A motion for new trial need not be filed as a condition precedent to appeal or consideration of any judgment, ruling, or order in any case; but, in all cases where a motion for new trial is an available remedy, the party entitled thereto may elect to file the motion first or to appeal directly. However, where matters complained of arise or are discovered subsequent to verdict or judgment which otherwise would not appear in the record, such as newly discovered evidence, and in other like instances, a motion for new trial or other available procedure shall be filed and together with all proceedings thereon shall become a part of the record on appeal. Otherwise, the motion for new trial need not be transmitted as a part of the record on appeal; nor shall it be necessary that the overruling thereof be enumerated as error (subject to the exception last stated), as the appellate court may consider all questions included in the enumeration of errors provided for in Code Section 5-6-40. The entry of judgment on a verdict by the trial court constitutes an adjudication by the trial court as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, affording a basis for review on appeal without further ruling by the trial court.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Since filing of motion for new trial is not condition precedent to appeal, an appeal may be made directly from any other appealable judgment, ruling, or order, but this does not negate appealability of ruling on motion for new trial when that procedure is utilized and it is desired to appeal from such ruling. The result is practically identical moreover, since the same grounds of appeal may be urged whichever judgment is appealed from and the appellants are not limited to grounds of motion for new trial in any appeal.

       - Losing party may file motion for judgment n.o.v., or the party may appeal directly from judgment and enumerate as error the denial of a directed verdict. If the losing party files a motion for judgment n.o.v. and obtains a ruling on it judgment, the losing party has used that device as a means of reviewing the motion for directed verdict at trial level. If ruling is adverse the losing party must enumerate it as error on appeal or become bound by the ruling and judgment unexcepted to, which becomes the law of the case. Wood v. Mobley, <cite class="ga_app_court">114 Ga. App. 170</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 358</cite> (1966).

       - When judgment is predicated upon jury verdict, the court has no plenary right to vacate, revise, or otherwise treat.

       - Appellate court declined to set aside the amount of the verdict for pain and suffering and wrongful death when a juvenile in a child care institution was accidentally electrocuted because $1,000,000 for pain and suffering and $2,000,000 for wrongful death were not excessive as a matter of law.

         Sufficiency of evidence, not its weight, is reviewed.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are questions for the triers of fact. The Court of Appeals passes on the sufficiency of the evidence, not the weight of the evidence, which is considered by the jury. Mosley v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 578</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 154</cite> (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Role of an appellate court is not to pass on the weight of the evidence but the sufficiency. If there is any evidence to support the verdict of the trial court the appellate court cannot disturb the verdict. Gay v. City of Rome, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">277 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While the trier of fact can and must weigh and analyze the evidence, an appellate court, in reviewing on the general grounds, is restricted to determining if there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment of conviction. After conviction, the evidence in the record is reviewed on appeal in the light most favorable to the state. Gibbs v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 530</cite>, <cite class="app_court">278 S.E.2d 111</cite> (1981).

         Ineffective assistance of counsel based on failure to comply with statute.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Because a motion for new trial did not need to be filed as a condition precedent to appeal or consideration of any judgment, ruling, or order in any case, the failure to file a motion for new trial could not serve as the basis for the appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim; thus, even assuming the appellant sufficiently alleged that purported error on the part of plea counsel was the cause of the appellant's failure to file a timely appeal, the appellant failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel on that ground. Henderson v. State, <cite class="ga_court">300 Ga. 526</cite>, <cite class="app_court">796 S.E.2d 681</cite> (2017).

      Unless otherwise provided by law, an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals by filing with the clerk of the court wherein the case was determined a notice of appeal. The notice shall set forth the title and docket number of the case; the name of the appellant and the name and address of his attorney; a concise statement of the judgment, ruling, or order entitling the appellant to take an appeal; the court appealed to; a designation of those portions of the record to be omitted from the record on appeal; a concise statement as to why the appellate court appealed to has jurisdiction rather than the other appellate court; and, if the appeal is from a judgment of conviction in a criminal case, a brief statement of the offense and the punishment prescribed. The appeal shall not be dismissed nor denied consideration because of failure to include the jurisdictional statement or because of a designation of the wrong appellate court. In addition, the notice shall state whether or not any transcript of evidence and proceedings is to be transmitted as a part of the record on appeal. Approval by the court is not required as a condition to filing the notice. All parties to the proceedings in the lower court shall be parties on appeal and shall be served with a copy of the notice of appeal in the manner prescribed by Code Section 5-6-32.

       - To define "proceedings in lower court," as used in this section to mean only those proceedings which directly relate to the appellant's enumerations of error is unduly restrictive because liberal construction comports with policies of this article, enhances efficient administration of justice, and avoids multiplicity of appeals.

       Burden is on the appellant to direct transmittal of the trial transcript and, lacking a transcript of the evidence, the court of appeals must assume that the proceedings, the jury's verdict, and the judgment entered upon that verdict, were correct.

       Trial court erred in dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant for failure to timely file a transcript for inclusion in the record on appeal because the appellant's failure to file a transcript could not be deemed to have caused an unreasonable delay as the appellant's notice of appeal did not designate a transcript for inclusion in the appellate record, and the choice of whether to include a transcript in the appellate record was left to the appellant; thus, the trial court abused the court's discretion in dismissing the appellant's notice of appeal.

       Because there was no evidence that an 11-day delay in the filing of a transcript for transmission as part of the appellate record discernibly delayed the docketing of the record in the appellate court, the trial court abused the court's discretion by concluding that the delay was unreasonable, and erred by dismissing an appeal.

       - Burden is on party desiring to take appeal to determine when judgment is filed in trial court, and to file notice of appeal within the 30-day period or within duly authorized extension of the 30-day period. Jordan v. Caldwell, <cite class="ga_court">229 Ga. 343</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E.2d 530</cite> (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because a litigant's appeal was untimely filed, despite evidence of mistaken delivery beyond the litigant's control, the superior court properly held that the court lacked discretion to find otherwise as the burden to timely file an appeal could not be relieved by providential cause and excusable neglect; thus, the court did not err in dismissing the appeal. Register v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 741</cite>, <cite class="app_court">647 S.E.2d 406</cite> (2007).

       - Deficiencies in the defendant's notice of appeal, which did not state the offense and punishment prescribed, did not justify dismissal of the appeal when the notice did provide the specific case number, style, court, and date on which the final judgment appealed from was entered and information contained in the notice, considered in conjunction with even a cursory inspection of the record, would make clear the judgment appealed from, as well as the offense and punishment.

        Trial court judgment finding against the appellant's counterclaim and refusing amendment of the counterclaim was affirmed because the ruling to which the appellant objected was not contained in the record before the appellate court; thus, there was nothing for the appellate court to review and the appellate court must presume the correctness of the ruling by the trial court.

       Appellants used ambiguous language in the appellants notice of appeal and did not include the statutory language suggested regarding whether or not a transcript was to be sent to the appellate court because, when the appellants filed the notice of appeal, there was a transcript of an earlier summary judgment hearing that was already on file, but the appellants had not filed a transcript of a second summary judgment hearing relevant to the appeal; and it was not clear from the appellants' notice of appeal whether the trial court clerk was to wait for the second transcript or send the record with only the transcript already on file.

Since the discovery responses of the parties, which were filed before the motion for summary judgment, have been omitted based on the record designation in the notice of appeal and based on the absence of an affidavit and a deposition cited in the summary judgment documents, it is obvious that the party omitted material evidence from the record on appeal, and therefore it must be presumed that the superior court record properly supports the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.

       - When the record on appeal contains enumerations of error which can only be resolved by reference to the evidence, and the appellant instructed the clerk to transmit the entire record on appeal and to "omit nothing," but did not order any transcript of evidence to be filed, and, as a result, no transcript was forwarded, the appellate court must affirm the judgment of the trial court.

        When the notice of appeal did not specify that a transcript of evidence

         Construction when meaning of section is unambiguous.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When language is plain, unambiguous, and positive, and is not capable of two constructions, no court has a right to construe the statute to mean anything other than what the statute declares, and this rule, of course, precludes courts from construing the statute according to what is supposed to be legislative intent. Bailey v. Bonaparte, <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">188 S.E.2d 119</cite> (1972).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Interpretation of word "appellee," as used in section, to mean only party against whom appeal is taken and who has a particular interest adverse to setting aside judgment appealed is too restrictive because a liberal construction of section comports with policies of this article, enhances efficient administration of justice, and avoids multiplicity of appeals.

       - Extraordinary motion for new trial was improper when the motion was based only on the general grounds and various evidentiary rulings made during the course of the trial, these are matters which could and should have been discovered and raised in a timely filed ordinary motion for new trial.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the trial court grants a motion for a directed verdict, then grants a motion for a new trial, ruling that the directed verdict motion was improvidently granted, and a second trial is conducted, followed by an appeal by the losing party, the appellate court is concerned only with the trial court's orders in the second trial and cannot address any enumerations of error as to the final orders of the trial court in the previous trial, as these judgments were not timely appealed.

       - When a defendant filed a notice of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, having previously filed a motion for a new trial after the verdict but before the defendant was sentenced, and later withdrew the motion for new trial, the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the defendant's appeal.

       Defendant's appeals did not qualify as direct appeals from the entry of the defendant's guilty pleas because the defendants were from a ruling on a motion filed ten years after the entry of judgment and sentence and were filed pursuant to notices of appeal that referred to the denial of the motion to void judgment.

        Dismissal of motion for new trial is a final disposition

       <p>
        <p>
       - Order sustaining general demurrer (now motion to dismiss) on merits and providing self-executing dismissal provision is a final order. If no notice of appeal is filed beforehand, case is not automatically dismissed until expiration of time allowed for amendments and an appeal within 30 days after such date is timely. Chambers v.

        Oral order is not final nor appealable until
       
       and unless the order is reduced to writing, signed by the judge, and filed with the clerk. This constitutes "entry" and it is only an "entered" decision or judgment which is appealable.

Accordingly, the denial of such a motion is not an order "otherwise finally disposing of the motion" so as to trigger the 30-day period established by subsection (a) of O.C.G.A.

       Although a trial court made no factual determination concerning the defendant's failure to pursue a direct appeal, a habeas court had previously determined that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily withdrew the new trial motion against the advice of counsel and waived the right to a direct appeal; as a result, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal under O.C.G.A.

       - Because an insured could not use a voluntary dismissal of one of the defendants as the vehicle for appellate review of rulings entered by the trial court more than 30 days from the filing of the notice of appeal, and no other final appealable ruling existed in the record, the insured's appeal was dismissed based on the appellate court's lack of jurisdiction.

       - In a tenant's action against the leasing agent of an apartment complex alleging that soot from an apartment heating system caused the tenant to suffer respiratory and lymph node problems, the agent's jurisdictional challenge to the tenant's cross-appeal from a trial court ruling that granted the agent's motion for a directed verdict on the tenant's claim for punitive damages was unsuccessful; within 15 days of being served with the tenant's notice of appeal, the tenant filed a notice of cross-appeal stating that the tenant was appealing from the grant of a directed verdict in favor of the agent on the punitive damages issue, and that was the tenant's sole claim of error on the cross-appeal.

        Burden is not satisfied by relying on postal delivery

        Judgment cannot be considered appealable until judgment is actually entered;
       
       therefore, when a notice of appeal is filed before entry of judgment, the appeal must be dismissed. Cunningham v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">131 Ga.

       - As it was clear that the appellant was appealing the entry of judgment in favor of the appellee, the notice of appeal was deemed filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment, despite the fact that the notice erroneously stated that it was from the prior directed verdict. Horton v. Allstate Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">171 Ga. App. 707</cite>, <cite class="app_court">320 S.E.2d 761</cite> (1984), overruled on other grounds, Carter v.

        Improper dismissal of an appeal from an order granting a motion for directed verdict occurred

        When a defendant voluntarily abandons the defendant's motion for a new trial
       
       and, therefore, no order was entered granting, overruling, or otherwise finally disposing of the motion, notice of appeal must still be filed within 30 days after entry of an appealable judgment.

       - In a creditor's fraudulent transfer action, the trial court had authority to enter dismissal orders after the creditor had filed a notice of appeal because the creditor failed to obtain a certificate of immediate review as required for interlocutory review in O.C.G.A.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Disposition of the motion for new trial obviated all need for an out-of-time appeal, since the defendant had 30 days after entry of that judgment in which to file an ordinary appeal. Nevertheless, while the denial of the new trial motion was the demise of the notice of appeal, filed earlier, as an out-of-time appeal, it served to vitalize it as a timely appeal. As a premature notice of appeal it became effective upon entry of a final judgment. Shirley v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga.

       Defendant's motion for an out of time appeal was the functional equivalent of a timely notice of appeal and was treated as such when the document: (1) was filed within the 30-day time limit of O.C.G.A.

       Out-of-time appeal is occasionally appropriate when, due to ineffective assistance of counsel, no appeal has been taken. But an appeal will lie from a judgment entered on a guilty plea only if the issue on appeal can be resolved by facts appearing in the record. Smith v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">268 Ga.

       While the Court of Appeals of Georgia initially stated that the defendant's appeal was subject to dismissal based on a failure to timely file a notice of appeal from the trial court's order denying an out-of-time motion for a new trial and for other relief, as required by O.C.G.A.

       - It was not an abuse of discretion to deny the defendant's motion for a new trial, requested to facilitate the defendant's efforts to become a naturalized citizen, because the trial court considered that the defendant's sentence for giving a false name to an officer had long since been served, that six years had passed since sentencing, and that the sentence was within the statutory guidelines for misdemeanors; claims the defendant's guilty plea was not voluntary were of no avail as the defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or to appeal and the times for doing so had expired.

       - Out-of-time appeal was appropriate when, as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, a timely direct appeal was not taken, and the movant for an out-of-time appeal needed to establish a good and sufficient reason entitling the movant to such an appeal; the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal was properly denied when the defendant claimed that the defendant's trial counsel did not provide the defendant with a copy of the plea hearing transcript, but also stated that the defendant first tried to obtain a copy of the transcript nearly eight months after the defendant's guilty plea and conviction, well after the time for a direct appeal had passed.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Denial of the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal from the defendant's conviction and sentence after the entry of a guilty plea was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant's claims that the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel did not show that defense counsel's conduct frustrated the defendant's right to appeal, the defendant did not have an unqualified right to appeal after the entry of a guilty plea, defendant failed to show how the trial court deviated from the negotiated plea as the record showed that the sentence matched the recommendation, and the defendant was not entitled to expand the record in an attempt to meet the defendant's burden for an out-of-time appeal. Jackson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">266 Ga. App. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">597 S.E.2d 535</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for an out-of-time direct appeal after the defendant plead guilty. The defendant had not shown that the issues raised could be decided upon facts appearing in the record and did not contend that ineffectiveness of counsel frustrated the defendant's right to file a timely direct appeal; rather, the defendant asserted that counsel failed to investigate, failed to object to the sufficiency of the accusation, failed to personally negotiate the plea agreement, and failed to file a material document. Smith v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">291 Ga. App. 459</cite>, <cite class="app_court">662 S.E.2d 253</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant's pro se motion for an out-of-time direct appeal was properly denied because the defendant's claims were meritless. A plea petition and a transcript showed that the defendant's guilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, and by not objecting to the failure to be placed under oath at the guilty plea hearing, the defendant waived the requirement of an oath. Sweeting v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">291 Ga. App. 693</cite>, <cite class="app_court">662 S.E.2d 785</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal. Based on a plea acknowledgment form, counsel's certification, and the plea colloquy, there was no merit to the defendant's claims that the defendant had not been informed of the nature of the charges and that the trial court failed to establish a factual basis for the defendant's guilty plea. Colbert v. State, <cite class="ga_court">284 Ga. 81</cite>, <cite class="app_court">663 S.E.2d 158</cite> (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal. The defendant clearly stated the defendant's desire to discontinue the services of trial counsel and accept punishment; in addition, although counsel informed the defendant of the appeal deadline after giving the defendant notice of counsel's intent to withdraw, the defendant waited 18 years before seeking an out-of-time appeal. Duncan v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">297 Ga. App. 499</cite>, <cite class="app_court">677 S.E.2d 691</cite> (2009).

       <p>
        <p>
       Defendant failed to show an abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal because the defendant failed to demonstrate in the current appeal that the defendant's direct appeal of right of the defendant's convictions and sentences was lost due to the professional deficiency of any attorney as the record showed that the defendant's attempted pro se direct appeal was properly dismissed as untimely.

       - Although the defendant alleged in the defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal that the defendant asked trial counsel to file an appeal from the defendant's criminal convictions and the defendant's trial counsel performed inadequately by failing to do so, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion as the defendant was also required to allege, but did not allege, the issues that the defendant would have raised if the out-of-time appeal were granted and that those issues could be resolved by reference to the facts in the record.

       When the defendant chose to denominate the defendant's motion as one to vacate and set aside the summary judgment, but the motion was nothing more than a request for a reconsideration of the trial court's summary judgment award, the motion did not extend the time for the filing of a notice of appeal, and therefore the notice of appeal was not timely filed.

       - When cross-appellants contended that because appellant in August 1986 successfully moved the trial court to allow the appellant to amend the appellant's notice of appeal merely to change the designated parts of the record necessary to the appellant's appeal and thus to delete certain portions of the record, this constituted a novation or extension of the appellant's original notice of appeal of April 11, 1986, it was held that the filing of the cross appeal in the Supreme Court on August 25 must be related to the original notice of appeal filed by appellant April 11 and could draw life from a mere modification of the notice of appeal reducing the amount of record as originally noticed in the original appeal. It followed that the filing of the notice of cross appeal on August 25, 1986, was far beyond the 15 days allowed for the filing of such a cross appeal. Mobley v.

         Failure to file notice of cross appeal makes review of brief unnecessary.

       - When appellee denominates one section of the appellee's brief a "cross appeal," but the record reveals that no notice of cross appeal was ever filed, the Court of Appeals need not address this contention in view of subsections (a) and (b) of O.C.G.A.

       When appellee asserted in a pro se responsive brief that the trial court erred in finding that the appellee was indebted to the appellant for post-acceleration interest on the accelerated balance, the court of appeals was unable to address this assertion since no cross-appeal had been filed.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Motion for out of time appeal was properly denied when the appellant alleged only that the appellant's attorney's inadequate performance was the reason why no timely appeal was filed and appellant failed to set forth the questions the appellant would raise in an out of time appeal and that the questions could be resolved by facts in the record. Wheeler v. State, <cite class="ga_court">269 Ga. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">499 S.E.2d 629</cite> (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because a direct appeal cannot be taken from a guilty plea on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel unless that issue was developed through a post-plea hearing, it cannot be said that the defendant's right of appeal was frustrated; simply put, the defendant had no right of appeal and the defendant's remedy lay in a habeas corpus proceeding. Rice v. State, <cite class="ga_court">278 Ga. 707</cite>, <cite class="app_court">606 S.E.2d 261</cite> (2004).

       - Burden is on party desiring to take appeal to determine when judgment is filed in trial court, and to file the party's notice of appeal within the 30-day period or within the duly authorized extension of the 30-day period. Jordan v. Caldwell, <cite class="ga_court">229 Ga. 343</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E.2d 530</cite> (1972); Associated Distribs., Inc. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Because a litigant's appeal was untimely filed, despite evidence of mistaken delivery beyond the litigant's control the superior court properly held that the court lacked discretion to find otherwise, as the burden to timely file an appeal could not be relieved by providential cause and excusable neglect; thus, the court did not err in dismissing the appeal. Register v. Elliott, <cite class="ga_app_court">285 Ga. App. 741</cite>, <cite class="app_court">647 S.E.2d 406</cite> (2007).

       - Failure to get an extension is not, standing alone, a sufficient basis for dismissal. Boulden v. Fowler, <cite class="ga_app_court">202 Ga. App. 237</cite>, <cite class="app_court">414 S.E.2d 263</cite> (1991), cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">202 Ga. App. 905</cite>, <cite class="app_court">414 S.E.2d 263</cite> (1992).

       Trial court properly dismissed the debtors' appeal as a transcript was not filed until over two months after the statutory due date, and the debtors did not request an extension of time to file the transcript; any delay in completing the record past the 30 days granted by statute was presumptively unreasonable and inexcusable. Dye v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n, <cite class="ga_app_court">273 Ga. App. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">616 S.E.2d 476</cite> (2005).

       Failure to obtain an extension in the filing of transcripts is not, in and of itself, a sufficient basis for dismissal. Welch v. Welch, <cite class="ga_app_court">212 Ga. App. 667</cite>, <cite class="app_court">442 S.E.2d 857</cite> (1994).

        Party wishing more time than permitted for appealing, should apply for extension

   6 (see O.C.G.A.
   §

   §
   10 (see O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-48" target="_self">5-6-48</a></cite>), the court has no alternative but to grant motion and dismiss the appeal. Hearn v. DeKalb County, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 467</cite> (1968).

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-39" target="_self">5-6-39</a></cite> gives courts authority to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal but this authority is limited by subsection (c) of

        Granting of out of time appeal by superior court

       Since a construction company bringing an appeal of a jury verdict in favor of homeowners never sought an extension of time to file the transcript from the post-trial hearing on its motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, nor communicated with the court reporter during the nine-month period after the hearing, the record did not support the trial court's finding that the delay in filing that transcript caused by the construction company was excusable and the trial court's denial of the homeowners' motion to dismiss the appeal was error; the record showed that the construction company's actions delayed a just disposition of the case by delaying the docketing of the appeal and hearing of the case by the appellate court, and, consequently, the homeowners were forced to wait for a final disposition on the construction company's appeal of the verdict against it.

       - When the time for filing the notice of appeal runs from the date of the voluntary dismissal of the appellees' counterclaims, the trial court is powerless to extend the time by entering a subsequent order reaffirming the dismissal of the complaint, even had it intended to do so.

       Trial court was permitted to deny the defendant's second request for an extension of time to file the defendant's notice of appeal because statutory law allowed only one extension of time to be granted for filing a notice of appeal; thus, the defendant's request for an out-of-time appeal after the defendant did not timely file the defendant's notice of appeal was properly denied as it was the defendant's own conduct which caused the defendant to fail to timely file the notice of appeal in spite of the fact the defendant knew both about the right to appeal and the right to obtain appointed counsel.

       - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying a condominium unit owner's (CUO) motion for a 90-day extension of time to file a notice of appeal in an action initiated by a neighboring condominium unit owner which was resolved in the neighboring owner's favor, as the CUO failed to refer to anything that would have constituted good cause for the extension, and there was no authority to grant an extension for longer than 30 days.

       Burden is on appellant to request extension
      
      for filing transcript, and this burden cannot be shifted to court reporter by implying latter's duty to apply for extension. Dunbar v. Green, <cite class="ga_court">232 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">205 S.E.2d 854</cite> (1974).
      </p>

       <p>
      Even though the initial delay in filing the transcript of the trial may not have been attributable to the minor, that did not excuse the filing delay in the absence of a proper request by the minor for an extension of time as required under O.C.G.A.

       - Because there was no evidence that an 11-day delay in the filing of a transcript for transmission as part of the appellate record discernibly delayed the docketing of the record in the appellate court, the trial court abused the court's discretion by concluding that the delay was unreasonable, and erred by dismissing an appeal.

       Even though alleged error was raised at trial, an adverse ruling received, and it is argued in brief, appellate courts will not consider it unless it is within enumerated error. MacDonald v.

       Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to consider grounds which though argued are not enumerated as error according to O.C.G.A.

        Alleged error raised for first time on brief,

       - Although appellate court could refuse to address any error not set out separately, the court may in the court's sound discretion elect to review any one or more of the assertions of error contained in a single enumeration and treat the rest as abandoned. Morris v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">203 Ga. App. 839</cite>, <cite class="app_court">418 S.E.2d 119</cite> (1992).

       When an appellant asserts more than one error within a single enumeration, the appellate court in the court's discretion may elect to review none, or one or more, of the errors asserted within the single enumeration. Hall v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">235 Ga. App. 44</cite>, <cite class="app_court">508 S.E.2d 703</cite> (1998).

       Provision of Ga. Const. 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Par.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the defendants failed to enumerate an argument on appeal, the appellate court would not consider the appeal. Smith v. Saulsbury, <cite class="ga_app_court">286 Ga. App. 322</cite>, <cite class="app_court">649 S.E.2d 344</cite> (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Any attempt to amend or enlarge an enumeration upon appeal
       
       will not be permitted. MacDonald v. MacDonald, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 565</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 142</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Enumerations of error cannot be enlarged by statements in brief
       
       to include issues not made in former. Leniston v. Bonfiglio, <cite class="ga_app_court">138 Ga. App. 151</cite>, <cite class="app_court">226 S.E.2d 1</cite> (1976).
       </p>

        Burden is on party alleging error
       
       to show the error affirmatively by the record. Moye v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 338</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 562</cite> (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Error must appear from record
       
       sent to appellate court by the clerk of the trial court. Moye v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">127 Ga. App. 338</cite>, <cite class="app_court">193 S.E.2d 562</cite> (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Any error shown upon record must stand or fall on the error's own merits
       
       and is not aided by accumulative effect of other claims of error. Hess Oil &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Nash, <cite class="ga_court">226 Ga. 706</cite>, <cite class="app_court">177 S.E.2d 70</cite> (1970), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">403 U.S. 922</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S.

        <p>

        When defendant fails to provide transcript,
       
       the appellate court must assume the trial court's findings were authorized by the evidence. MacDonald v. MacDonald, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 565</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 142</cite> (1980).

       Only alleged errors occurring in lower court may be enumerated in appeal,
      
      and a statute may not be constitutionally attacked for first time in enumerations of error so as to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction of the appeal. Kohl v. Manning, <cite class="ga_court">223 Ga. 755</cite>, <cite class="app_court">158 S.E.2d 375</cite> (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Any ruling or judgment of court affecting judgment appealed from
      
      may be enumerated as error by the appellant. Allen v. Rome Kraft Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">114 Ga. App. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E.2d 618</cite> (1966).

       Overruling of motion for new trial
      
      does affect judgment on verdict, and may be enumerated. Allen v. Rome Kraft Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">114 Ga. App. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">152 S.E.2d 618</cite> (1966).

        <p>
       - Error of law has as its basis a specific ruling made by the trial court. In order for an appellate court to review a trial court ruling for legal error, a party must set forth in the enumeration of errors the allegedly erroneous ruling. Felix v. State, <cite class="ga_court">271 Ga. 534</cite>, <cite class="app_court">523 S.E.2d 1</cite> (1999).

      <p>
       <p>
      When the defendant asserts several errors in one enumeration, the court will address only one asserted error, especially when the defendant raises new grounds for some of the defendant's objections for the first time on appeal.

       - It is desirable that each enumeration be explicit, precise, intelligible, unambiguous, unmistakable, and unequivocal. But, a degree of generality may be tolerated. This is not to be used as a sword against an appellee to enlarge or amend an enumeration of error, or to encompass bases of objection not fairly included within legitimate parameters urged at trial, but is a shield to accommodate appeal of specific allegation of error. MacDonald v. MacDonald, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 565</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 142</cite> (1980).

       - Enumeration of error upon admission of evidence complaining that the admission created a false and prejudicial issue, in order to be complete, must set out how evidence was prejudicial and what false issue was created. Essig v. Cheves, <cite class="ga_app_court">75 Ga. App. 870</cite>, <cite class="app_court">44 S.E.2d 712</cite> (1947) (decided under former Code 1933,

        Complaint that illegal rulings were made without setting out nature of rulings,
       
       is insufficient as an assignment of error. Harbour v. Rittenbaum, <cite class="ga_app_court">101 Ga. App. 878</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 573</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933,

      Georgia Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Georgia have made clear that failure to file an enumeration of errors requires dismissal of an appeal and that arguments raised in the appellate brief are not made issues on appeal unless the arguments are properly enumerated as error. Furthermore, the Georgia Court of Appeals will not comb through the appellate brief to attempt to discern what errors the appellant seeks to assert on appeal. Complete Wiring Solutions, LLC v. Astra Group, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">335 Ga. App. 723</cite>, <cite class="app_court">781 S.E.2d 597</cite> (2016).

       Failure to file enumeration within time specified
      
      may be deemed as failure to complete appeal. Watson v. Stynchcombe, <cite class="ga_court">228 Ga. 193</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E.2d 580</cite> (1971); Seigler v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">228 Ga. 270</cite>, <cite class="app_court">185 S.E.2d 377</cite> (1971).

       - Absent filing of enumeration of errors within time prescribed or, in the alternative, absent grant of extension of time on motion made before expiration of such time, appeal has not been perfected and must be dismissed.

       Defendant's motion to amend the defendant's out-of-time appeal, presenting additional grounds, was denied because the motion was filed 49 days after the appeal was docketed, and enumerations of error must be filed within 20 days of docketing. Leverette v. State, <cite class="ga_court">291 Ga. 834</cite>, <cite class="app_court">732 S.E.2d 255</cite> (2012).

       - When enumeration of errors was filed within time required for filing briefs, fact that brief was not marked "filed" within that time due to nonpayment of costs does not invalidate filing of enumeration of errors. Norton Realty &amp; Loan Co. v. City of Gainesville, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 166</cite>, <cite class="app_court">160 S.E.2d 819</cite> (1968).

        When providential cause is shown,

       In all misdemeanor cases, the trial judge may, in the judge's discretion, require the reporting and transcribing of the evidence and proceedings by a court reporter on terms prescribed by the trial judge.

       In all civil cases tried in the superior and city courts and in any other court, the judgments of which are subject to review by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, the trial judge thereof may require the parties to have the proceedings and evidence reported by a court reporter, the costs thereof to be borne equally between them; and, where an appeal is taken which draws in question the transcript of the evidence and proceedings, it shall be the duty of the appellant to have the transcript prepared at the appellant's expense. Where it is determined that the parties, or either of them, are financially unable to pay the costs of reporting or transcribing, the judge may, in the judge's discretion, authorize trial of the case unreported; and, when it becomes necessary for a transcript of the evidence and proceedings to be prepared, it shall be the duty of the moving party to prepare the transcript from recollection or otherwise.

Where matters occur which were not reported, such as objections to oral argument, misconduct of the jury, or other like instances, the court, upon motion of either party, shall require that a transcript of these matters be made and included as a part of the record. The transcript of proceedings shall not be reduced to narrative form unless by agreement of counsel; but, where the trial is not reported or the transcript of the proceedings for any other reason is not available and the evidence is prepared from recollection, it may be prepared in narrative form.

       Where a civil or criminal trial is reported by a court reporter and the evidence and proceedings are transcribed, the reporter shall complete the transcript and file the original and one copy thereof with the clerk of the trial court, together with the court reporter's certificate attesting to the correctness thereof. In criminal cases where the accused was convicted of a capital felony, an additional copy shall be filed for the Attorney General, for which the court reporter shall receive compensation from the Department of Law as provided by law. The original transcript shall be transmitted to the appellate court as a part of the record on appeal; and one copy will be retained in the trial court, both as referred to in Code Section 5-6-43. Upon filing by the reporter, the transcript shall become a part of the record in the case and need not be approved by the trial judge.

If anything material to either party is omitted from the record on appeal or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation, or the trial court, either before or after the record is transmitted to the appellate court, on a proper suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement shall be corrected and, if necessary, that a supplemental record shall be certified and transmitted by the clerk of the trial court.

In case of the inability of the parties to agree as to the correctness of such transcript, the decision of the trial judge thereon shall be final and not subject to review; and, if the trial judge is unable to recall what transpired, the judge shall enter an order stating that fact.

       One purpose of requirement of filing transcript under subsections (a) and (e)
      
      is to afford local counsel in county where case was tried convenient access to exact duplicate copy of record so as to enable counsel to easily ascertain proper references to be included in counsel's brief and written argument.

       - When evidence was not reported, the only way of obtaining brief of evidence upon which the court may consider whether there should be a grant of the new trial is provided by this section and if the judge is unable to remember the evidence the evidence shall enter an order to that effect.

       - Trial court's award of attorney fees to a corporation was upheld as the sheriff challenging the award failed to file a transcript, and the appellate court had to assume that the trial court was authorized to award the fees.

        When defendant claimed that the jury was not sworn,

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-43ol1a" target="_self">5-6-43(a)</a></cite> contemplates requests by the appellee to include portions of the record that the appellant has designated for exclusion, it does not authorize the appellee to request exclusion of items the appellant desires to include.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court erred in ordering the trial court clerk to omit from the appellate record all submissions filed after entry of the permanent injunction because the statutory scheme presumes that a complete record will be transmitted to the appellate court unless the appellant specifically requests otherwise. McHugh Fuller Law Group, PLLC v. PruittHealth-Toccoa, LLC, <cite class="ga_court">297 Ga. 94</cite>, <cite class="app_court">772 S.E.2d 660</cite> (2015).

       - Obligation of the appellant relates to the transcript, and the obligation for the preparation of the record rests with the clerk. After the appellant has filed a notice of appeal, the appellant's duty as to the record is limited to the payment of costs. When the clerk fails to transmit the record, but there is no indication that this failure is occasioned by the failure of a party to pay costs, the trial court has no discretion to dismiss the appeal.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Although trial counsel failed to inform the appellant of the right to have the trial and proceedings transcribed, the appellant, through appellate counsel, did not attempt to file a transcript or stipulation of the case pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-41" target="_self">5-6-41</a></cite>; accordingly, it is presumed that the lack of actual transcription was not prejudicial. Southerton v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">205 Ga. App. 366</cite>, <cite class="app_court">422 S.E.2d 251</cite> (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       While any party in a civil case may, as a matter of right, have a case reported at the party's own expense, it is not incumbent upon the trial judge to arrange for the official reporter to take down the evidence, and when the plaintiff declined to have the hearing transcribed through a court reporter, the plaintiff could not later complain of the lack of a reporter. Hixson v. Hickson, <cite class="ga_app_court">236 Ga. App. 894</cite>, <cite class="app_court">512 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1999).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When there is no direct proof of prejudice or bias on the part of a jury, an appellate court can set aside the verdict as excessive only when the amount, considered in connection with all the facts in evidence at trial, shakes the moral senses, i.e., the verdict must carry its death warrant on the verdict's face; however, such issues must be determined from the trial transcript, and when no transcript was either ordered or made for a trial in which a jury entered a judgment against a mortgage company, and the mortgage company made no attempt to have the trial court make a transcript or a reconstructed transcript of the proceedings approved by the trial judge, the appellate court assumed that the judgment was correct and supported by the evidence. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. v. Cook, <cite class="ga_app_court">267 Ga. App. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">599 S.E.2d 319</cite> (2004).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Burden is on the appellants to prepare a copy of the transcript for inclusion in the appellate record. Young v. First Am. Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">196 Ga. App. 348</cite>, <cite class="app_court">396 S.E.2d 73</cite> (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        It is the duty of appellant to have transcript prepared, if the transcript is needed
       
       for a decision in the case. Graham v. Haley, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 498</cite>, <cite class="app_court">162 S.E.2d 346</cite> (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Appellate court presumed that a trial court's judgment granting a writ of possession was correct as the appellant failed to file a transcript of the proceedings and apparently did not attempt to reconstruct the transcript on appeal. Fisher v. One Stop Mortg., <cite class="ga_app_court">258 Ga. App. 479</cite>, <cite class="app_court">574 S.E.2d 605</cite> (2002).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Because there was no evidence that an 11-day delay in the filing of a transcript for transmission as part of the appellate record discernibly delayed the docketing of the record in the appellate court, the trial court abused the court's discretion by concluding that the delay was unreasonable, and erred by dismissing an appeal. Fulton County Bd. of Tax Assessors v. Love, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 252</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 576</cite> (2008).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court did not err in only allowing defendant in forma pauperis 45 minutes in which to employ a court reporter after the defendant appeared at the hearing without one when the defendant was provided at least two weeks' notice of the date of the hearing and could have arranged for a court reporter to be present within this time period.

       <p>
        <p>

        Filing of a pauper's affidavit
       
       does not relieve the appellant in a civil action from the responsibility of having the transcript prepared, pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       - Enumeration of errors dependent upon transcript of evidence and proceedings cannot be reviewed by appellate court when it is not reported, there is a dispute between counsel of both parties as to what actually transpired at the hearing, and the trial court is unable to recall it.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.17.html#t17c08s17-8-5" target="_blank">17-8-5</a></cite>), it would appear that in a felony case all testimony and proceedings must be reported, except argument of counsel.

       <p>
        <p>
       - When the court reporter worked over 100 hours and was unable to decipher inaudible tapes, and the trial court and counsel were unable to reconstruct record, failure of state to file correct transcript, through no fault of the appellant, effectively deprives the defendant of the defendant's right of appeal. Knowles v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga.

        <p>
       Failure of state to file transcript, or correct transcript, even when caused, as here, by the state's inability to file it (and not by appellant's fault), effectively denies appellant the appellant's right to appeal because a complete and correct transcript of the appellant's trial is not available to the appellant.

       - Defendant failed to demonstrate that the loss of two videotapes had harmed the defendant or precluded the appellate court from reviewing any of the issues raised on appeal with regard to the defendant's convictions for multiple offenses relating to the sexual molestation and exploitation of two minors. Significantly, although the videotapes were missing, the parties had stipulated to the contents of the tapes at the bench trial and to the proffered testimony of the minor victims. Mitchell v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">289 Ga. App. 55</cite>, <cite class="app_court">656 S.E.2d 145</cite> (2007), cert. dismissed, No. S08C0770, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 499 (Ga. 2008).

       <p>
        <p>
       Although the habeas court erred in resting the court's judgment on procedural default, the denial of habeas relief was affirmed because the petitioner could not show from the record that the petitioner was not represented by counsel and that a pro se notice of appeal was legally valid and acted to deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to try the petitioner.

       Whether transcript shall be prepared in misdemeanor case initially

      It lies within the discretion of the trial court to grant or deny an indigent the transcription of the trial of a misdemeanor. Hughes v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga. App. 413</cite>, <cite class="app_court">309 S.E.2d 409</cite> (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In misdemeanor cases, it is discretionary with the trial court as to whether the proceedings are transcribed. Thus, absent a demand for a transcript, prepared at the request of the demanding party, the reporting of such a case is not required as a matter of law. Ward v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 372</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 65</cite> (1988).

       <p>
        <p>
       - In misdemeanor cases, it is within the trial court's discretion to require the reporting and transcribing of the evidence and proceedings by a court reporter, but two factors need to be considered on the record in evaluating an indigent defendant's claim to a free transcript: (1) the transcript's value in connection with the defendant's trial or appeal; and (2) the accessibility of other means that would fulfill the same functions as a transcript. Failure to make that evaluation on the record is not a proper exercise of a trial court's discretion. Stanley v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">267 Ga.

        <p>
       - When a trial court, sua sponte, has not ordered such, an indigent defendant, on trial on a misdemeanor charge, must make a request or motion to the trial court that evidence and proceedings be reported and transcribed.

       - Absent demand by the defendant in a misdemeanor case for preparation of a transcript at the defendant's own expense under subsection (j), the defendant has not been denied a transcript of the defendant's misdemeanor conviction. Williams v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">140 Ga. App. 87</cite>, <cite class="app_court">230 S.E.2d 94</cite> (1976).

       <p>
        <p>
       In criminal misdemeanor proceedings, the trial court did not err in accepting the defendant's waiver of takedown; because the defendant did not elect to have the proceedings taken down, whether the proceedings were reported was a matter within the trial court's discretion under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-41ol1b" target="_self">5-6-41(b)</a></cite>, and the defendant failed to use the remedy provided under

       <p>
        <p>
       Trial court did not err by failing to order transcription of a defendant's misdemeanor proceeding without ascertaining the defendant's indigence status or obtaining a waiver. Under O.C.G.A.

When a defendant was facing a potential criminal conviction with possible resulting fine or imprisonment, such a duty cannot be read into these statutes. Thompson v.

       Defendant's contention that possible error occurred during voir dire or that defense counsel may have been ineffective and that, because of the lack of a record, the defendant would never know if there was error was not a sufficient basis to require a new trial. Primas v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">231 Ga. App. 861</cite>, <cite class="app_court">501 S.E.2d 28</cite> (1998).

       Although the defendant asserted that because voir dire was not transcribed, it was impossible to determine whether any errors occurred therein, so the judgment should have been reversed or the case should have been remanded to the trial court pursuant to O.C.G.A.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-41ol1f" target="_self">5-6-41(f)</a></cite>, the appellate court found that the general unspecified hope of reversible error during voir dire did not win a new trial on the ground that a record should have been made so as to accommodate a search for error now buried in unrecorded history.

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a change of venue because although the court reporter transcribed the motion for change of venue and the trial court's ruling, the actual questions and answers of the prospective jurors were not reported, and defense counsel made no motion at that time to include the answers in the record or to have the answers reconstructed for the record; since voir dire was not transcribed, it was assumed that the jurors who were not excused for cause did not have such fixed opinions that the jurors could not be impartial judges of the defendant's guilt.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-41ol1a" target="_self">5-6-41(a)</a></cite> did not require that voir dire be reported in all felony cases; (3) while it was mandatory that voir dire be made part of the record in cases imposing the death penalty, the death penalty was not imposed; (4) a review of the existing trial transcript indicated that one of the sitting jurors was arrested on outstanding traffic-related charges, but that juror was replaced with one of the alternates prior to jury deliberations; and (5) merely asserting a general unspecified hope of reversible error during voir dire was insufficient to warrant a new trial on the ground that a transcript of the proceeding should have been made so as to accommodate a search for error now buried in unrecorded history.

       - Under old law, transcript on appeal contained only evidence and did not contain any objections, colloquies, and various rulings of the court on matters arising during trial.

       - Because an appellant failed to include in the transcript record appellant's request for a continuance, as well as nothing regarding the nature of this request or the parameters of the trial court's denial of this request, the appellate court refused to hold that the trial court erred in declining to grant a continuance.

       - Requests to charge are of such importance in an appeal when the trial court's giving of a charge is cited as error that the appellate court will order the clerk of the trial court to submit that portion of the trial record to the appellate court pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A.

       Because the defendant was deprived of an adequate trial transcript when a fire at the court reporter's house destroyed the tapes and materials for the transcript, the defendant was denied the defendant's right to appeal, and the defendant was therefore entitled to a new trial; the state's 14-page recreation of the six-day trial prepared under O.C.G.A.

        <p>
       - When, after a lunch break during the guilt phase of the trial, the trial court made a few remarks to the jury while awaiting the return of the defendant, and the trial judge later restated the judge's comments, as well as the judge could remember the comments, into the record, relating that the judge had told the jury that the trial would be slightly delayed because the defendant had eaten late, and had congratulated one of the jurors for having been elected to the board of education, there was no violation of O.C.G.A.

       - When during a defendant's bench trial, the evidence was not recorded, the defendant did not request or otherwise arrange for recording and, afterwards, the state and the defendant were unable to agree on what transpired during trial, the defendant was afforded the next best thing to a transcript, i.e., the recollected testimony of all witnesses in the criminal trial plus the testimony of persons who observed it.

       - Because the defendant was deprived of an adequate trial transcript when a fire at the court reporter's house destroyed the tapes and materials for the transcript, the defendant was denied the defendant's right to appeal, and the defendant was therefore entitled to a new trial; the state's 14-page recreation of the six-day trial prepared under O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Obligation of the appellant relates to the transcript, and the obligation for the preparation of the record rests with the clerk. After the appellant has filed a notice of appeal, the appellant's duty as to the record is limited to the payment of costs. When the clerk fails to transmit the record, but there is no indication that this failure is occasioned by the failure of a party to pay costs, the trial court has no discretion to dismiss the appeal. Long v. City of Midway, <cite class="ga_court">251 Ga. 364</cite>, <cite class="app_court">306 S.E.2d 639</cite> (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Appellant had no obligation to file transcript until the appellant's motion for new trial was disposed of,
       
       and the failure to do so or the failure to pay for and file the transcript as soon as it is ready has no controlling bearing on the question of unreasonable delay in filing the transcript after notice of appeal as required by O.C.G.A.

       - Requests to charge are of such importance in an appeal when the trial court's giving of a charge is cited as error that the appellate court will order the clerk of the trial court to submit that portion of the trial record to the appellate court pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       - It is duty of state to request court reporter to transcribe reported testimony and then file transcript after guilty verdict had been returned in a felony case. However, the state's duty to request court reporter to transcribe reported testimony in felony conviction had no time limit and thus cannot relieve the appellant in felony conviction of duty the court reporter to request court reporter to transcribe reported testimony at same time that the court reporter files a notice of appeal.

       In an appeal of a criminal conviction, the appellate court chose to sua sponte reinstate the case to address the appellant's enumerations of error on the merits despite the failure to set forth in the notice of appeal the intention to rely upon a previously transmitted transcript because the court had not yet addressed the issue in a published opinion and used the case to place future appellants on notice that similar procedural errors may result in automatic affirmance of a trial court's decision.

       - Burden is on appellant to file transcript of evidence within 30 days of filing of notice of appeal, or if transcript cannot be obtained within that time the appellant must obtain an extension of time to file a transcript. Failure to timely file a transcript makes it affirmatively appear that the failure was caused by the appellant. Fahrig v.

       Statutory law placed burden not only of paying for transcript, but making sure it was filed, on the party taking the appeal, and since the patient had that burden and shirked that responsibility, resulting in a greater than three-year delay that prejudiced the surgical business and doctor, the trial court was entitled to involuntarily dismiss the patient's appeal.

       Since a construction company bringing an appeal of a jury verdict in favor of homeowners never sought an extension of time to file the transcript from the post-trial hearing on the company's motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, nor communicated with the court reporter during the nine-month period after the hearing, the record did not support the trial court's finding that the delay in filing that transcript caused by the construction company was excusable and the trial court's denial of the homeowners' motion to dismiss the appeal was error; the record showed that the construction company's actions delayed a just disposition of the case by delaying the docketing of the appeal and hearing of the case by the appellate court, and, consequently, the homeowners were forced to wait for a final disposition on the construction company's appeal of the verdict against the company.

       Trial court properly dismissed the debtors' appeal as a transcript was not filed until over two months after the statutory due date, and the debtors did not request an extension of time to file the transcript; any delay in completing the record past the 30 days granted by statute was presumptively unreasonable and inexcusable. Dye v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n, <cite class="ga_app_court">273 Ga. App. 652</cite>, <cite class="app_court">616 S.E.2d 476</cite> (2005).

       Intent of section
      
      is to allow joint motions for new trial when two cases are consolidated for purposes of trial. Fair v. State, <cite class="ga_court">220 Ga. 750</cite>, <cite class="app_court">141 S.E.2d 431</cite> (1965).

       Consolidation of cases for trial does not merge cases into one;
      
      thus, consent by nonresident plaintiff to consolidation of suits with several plaintiffs does not constitute waiver of venue so that the defendant can bring a nonresident plaintiff into one of the separate actions as a third-party defendant.

       In all criminal cases, the notice of appeal filed as provided in Code Sections 5-6-37 and 5-6-38 shall serve as supersedeas in all cases where a sentence of death has been imposed or where the defendant is admitted to bail. If the sentence is bailable, the defendant may give bond in an amount prescribed by the presiding judge, with security approved by the clerk, conditioned upon the defendant's personal appearance to abide the final judgment or sentence of the court. If the judgment or sentence is or includes a fine which is unconditionally required to be paid, and is not required to be paid over a period of probation, nor as a condition of a suspended or probated sentence, nor as an alternative sentence, the bond may also be conditioned upon payment of the fine at the time the defendant appears to abide the final judgment or sentence.
      </li>
      <li id="t05c06s5-6-45ol1b">
       If the defendant is a corporation which has been convicted as provided in Code Section 17-7-92, the presiding judge, on the motion of the defendant, prosecuting attorney, or on its own motion, may order that supersedeas be conditioned upon the posting of a supersedeas bond. Said order may be entered either before or after the filing of a motion for a new trial or notice of appeal. The bond shall be in an amount prescribed by the presiding judge, with security approved by the clerk, conditioned upon the defendant's appearance, by and through a corporate officer, agent, or attorney at law, to satisfy the judgment, together with all costs and interest. If the corporation fails to make the bond as ordered, the prosecuting attorney or other proper officer may use any and all lawful process and procedures available to enforce and collect the judgment. Should final judgment be entered in favor of the defendant, the presiding judge shall order a refund of all amounts collected in satisfaction of the judgment. The State of Georgia, and its political subdivisions, district attorney, solicitor-general, sheriff, marshal, all other proper officers, and all agents and employees of the aforementioned persons shall be immune from all civil liability for acts and attempts to enforce and collect a judgment under this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t05c06s5-6-45ol1c">
       Any supersedeas bond may be reviewed by the presiding judge on the motion of defendant, prosecuting attorney, or on its own motion, and the court may require new or additional security, or order the bond strengthened, increased, reduced, or otherwise amended as justice may reasonably require.

        Trial judge may use discretion

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      Granting or refusing of bail in felony cases after indictment and conviction is a matter within sound discretion of trial court, and Supreme Court on appeal will not control that discretion unless that discretion has been flagrantly abused. Watts v. Grimes, <cite class="ga_court">224 Ga. 227</cite>, <cite class="app_court">161 S.E.2d 286</cite> (1968).

       - Notice of appeal did not serve as a supersedeas and generally divested the trial court of jurisdiction to alter or execute a judgment of conviction since the defendant had not been found guilty of theft by receiving, and thus there was no judgment of conviction to appeal.

       - Release on bond should not be granted unless the court finds that there is no substantial risk the defendant will not appear to answer the judgment following conclusion of the appellate proceedings and that the defendant is not likely to commit a serious crime, intimidate witnesses or otherwise interfere with the administration of justice, and that the appeal is not frivolous or taken for delay.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Trial court's jurisdiction to reconsider the court's order to return property, which was removed when the state filed the state's notice of appeal, is not retroactively supplied by the fact that the appeal was later dismissed by order of the supreme court for lack of a right of appeal in the state.

       In a criminal case, the trial court maintains jurisdiction over the injunctive relief granted to the state in cases ordering involuntary medication of a defendant, including any modification or stay of that relief. Either the government or the defendant may move to revise the court's sell order if circumstances change during a defendant's treatment. Johnson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">341 Ga.

       In civil cases, the notice of appeal filed as provided in Code Sections 5-6-37 and 5-6-38 shall serve as supersedeas upon payment of all costs in the trial court by the appellant and it shall not be necessary that a supersedeas bond or other form of security be filed; provided, however, that upon motion by the appellee, made in the trial court before or after the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, the trial court shall require that supersedeas bond or other form of security be given with such surety and in such amount as the court may require, conditioned for the satisfaction of the judgment in full, together with costs, interest, and damages for delay if the appeal is found to be frivolous. When the judgment is for the recovery of money not otherwise secured, the amount of the bond or other form of security shall be fixed at such sum as will cover the whole amount of the judgment remaining unsatisfied, costs on the appeal, interest, and damages for delay, unless the court after notice and hearing and for good cause shown fixes a lesser amount. When the judgment determines the disposition of the property in controversy as in real actions, trover, and actions to foreclose mortgages and other security instruments, or when such property is in the custody of the sheriff or other levying officer, or when the proceeds of such property or a bond for its value are in the custody or control of the court, the amount of the supersedeas bond or other form of security shall be fixed at such sum only as will secure the amount recovered for the use and detention of the property, the costs of the action, costs on appeal, interest, and damages for delay.

       - In civil action, filing of notice of appeal does not serve as supersedeas until all costs in the trial court have been paid. Chappelaer v. General G.M.C. Trucks, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">130 Ga. App. 664</cite>, <cite class="app_court">204 S.E.2d 326</cite> (1974); Penny Profit Foods, Inc. v. McMullen, <cite class="ga_app_court">214 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In a civil action, the filing of a notice of appeal does not serve as a supersedeas until all costs in the trial have been paid; when all costs are paid, the trial court loses jurisdiction over the case while the appeal is pending. Duncan v. Ball, <cite class="ga_app_court">172 Ga. App. 750</cite>, <cite class="app_court">324 S.E.2d 477</cite> (1984); Rockdale Awning &amp; Iron Co. v. Kerbow, <cite class="ga_app_court">210 Ga. App. 119</cite>, <cite class="app_court">435 S.E.2d 619</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Filing of notice of appeal did not serve as a supersedeas because the appellant failed to pay all costs in the trial court and all costs in the appeals preparation. Lott v. Arrington &amp; Hollowell, P.C., <cite class="ga_app_court">258 Ga. App. 51</cite>, <cite class="app_court">572 S.E.2d 664</cite> (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Notice of appeal did not serve as a supersedeas when all costs had not been paid, and although the appellate courts do not condone a party's failure to respond to the motion to dismiss in the first instance, the trial court was not deprived of jurisdiction to consider and rule on that party's motion to set aside the dismissal. Lunsford v. DeKalb Med. Ctr., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">263 Ga. App. 394</cite>, <cite class="app_court">587 S.E.2d 859</cite> (2003).

        <p>
       - In an action by mortgagors against mortgagee and foreclosure sale purchaser to challenge the lawfulness of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, a supersedeas bond was authorized even though no money judgment was entered against the mortgagors. Cloud v. Georgia Cent. Credit Union, <cite class="ga_app_court">214 Ga. App. 594</cite>, <cite class="app_court">448 S.E.2d 913</cite> (1994).

       Borrower failed to show that the trial court abused the court's discretion in setting a $300,000 supersedeas bond because the case fell within the disposition-of-property provision of O.C.G.A.

       <p>
        <p>
       - In the absence of a traverse to the appellant's affidavit, it is error to deny the appellant's motion to proceed in forma pauperis. When such a denial does occur, the appellant must be reimbursed for all costs actually paid by the appellant because of the requirements of subsection (a) of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-43" target="_self">5-6-43</a></cite>. However, the appellant is not entitled to be reimbursed for attorney's fees incurred during the appellant's appeal.

       Defendants in a RICO action failed to exercise the defendants' right to open a prematurely entered default judgment as a matter of right by filing an answer and costs within the 15-day period provided in O.C.G.A.

       - Requiring supersedeas bond on motion of appellee to trial court is intended to prevent notice of appeal from serving as supersedeas, and does not operate as a condition precedent to the appellant's right to have the appeal transmitted to the appellate court for review. In absence of such bond as may be required by appropriate court, appellee is free to enforce judgment at the appellee's peril pending decision on appeal. DeFee v.

        When final judgment was entered against the issuer based on a supersedeas bond,
       
       and the judgment was not challenged or otherwise modified, vacated, or set aside, the issuer could not go behind the judgment, as a defendant in fieri facias, and attack the validity of the bond.

       <p>
        <p>
       - Failure to comply with order to post supersedeas bond has sole effect of removing any supersedeas features of appeal, and leaves appellee at liberty, if the appellee chooses to do so, to make whatever levy of execution or other action may be available to collect the appellee's debt, always remembering that the appellee does so at the appellee's peril if judgment is reversed on appeal.

        Trial court erred by denying the plaintiff's motion for a supersedeas bond
       
       after the plaintiff successfully obtained a jury verdict against the defendants; the plaintiff exercised the statutory right to move the trial court for a supersedeas bond and was under no obligation either to ask for a hearing or to show that the defendants were incapable of satisfying the judgment against the defendants. The trial court was obligated to require the defendants to post a supersedeas bond in the full amount of the judgment, including costs, interest, and damages, unless, after notice and hearing, the court found good cause for fixing a lesser amount.

       In a breach of contract suit brought by an oncologist against a corporation, the corporation's failure to submit an opposing affidavit to the oncologist's pauper's affidavit did not alter the fact that the trial court's findings regarding the oncologist's indigency were not subject to appellate review.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Section contains specific and limited grounds for dismissal and is replete with provisions for liberal amendment to meet technical objections to appeals, to the end of facilitating a proper decision on the merits. Munday v. Brissette, <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 147</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E.2d 55</cite>, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 162</cite>, <cite class="app_court">149 S.E.2d 110</cite> (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Section opens notice of appeal to extrinsic construction
       
       for first time and puts burden on court to examine orders themselves in determining from which orders an appeal has been taken. Brackett v. Allison, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 632</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E.2d 611</cite> (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Entire section gives to court a very broad discretion.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - It is the policy of both appellate courts in Georgia to attempt to avoid dismissing appeals and to try to reach the merits of every case when it can be done consistent with the mandate of the law. Johnson v. Daniel, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 926</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1975); Gilland v. Leathers, <cite class="ga_app_court">141 Ga.

       <p>
        <p>
       When the plaintiff failed to file enumerations of error as a separate document, but did set forth enumerations of error in the plaintiff's brief, it was apparent from the notice of appeal, the brief, the enumerations of error in that brief, and the record, exactly what judgment was appealed from and what errors were asserted, and a liberal construction of the Appellate Practice Act, O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-30" target="_self">5-6-30</a></cite> et seq.,

         Section does not limit judicial authority under rule regarding dismissal.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Judicial authority under Rule 39, Rules of the Supreme Court to dismiss appeal for failure to comply with order to file enumeration of error is not prohibited by Ga. L. 1965, p. 18,
   §
   23 (see O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-30" target="_self">5-6-30</a></cite>), which expresses an intent to avoid dismissals, and is not limited by the three grounds for dismissal contained in Ga. L. 1968, p. 1072,
   §§
   2, 3. Taylor v. Columbia County Planning Comm'n, <cite class="ga_court">232 Ga. 155</cite>, <cite class="app_court">205 S.E.2d 287</cite> (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Belated filing of separate enumerations of error is not a basis for dismissal of an appeal.

  <cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.36.html#t36c91s36-91-90" target="_blank">36-91-90</a></cite> et seq., seeking to recover against a payment bond for amounts due for labor and materials provided on a construction project on private property, the court dismissed the subcontractors' appeal because the subcontractors failed to set forth an enumeration of errors as required by O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-40" target="_self">5-6-40</a></cite>. Complete Wiring Solutions, LLC v. Astra Group, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">335 Ga. App. 723</cite>, <cite class="app_court">781 S.E.2d 597</cite> (2016).

        Former Rule 14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (see Rule 39) is directory
       
       and its violation does not constitute one of the limited grounds for dismissal as prescribed by this section. Durham v. Stand-By Labor of Ga., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 558</cite>, <cite class="app_court">198 S.E.2d 145</cite> (1973).

       <p>
        <p>
       - In order for the trial court to order the dismissal of an appeal, it must appear that the delay between the filing of the notice of appeal and the subsequent filing of the transcript was unreasonable and that the unreasonable delay was inexcusable. Gay v. City of Rome, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">277 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1981).

       - In passing upon issues of unreasonable delay and inexcusable delay, the trial court has discretion. However, it is a legal discretion which is subject to review in the appellate courts. Gay v. City of Rome, <cite class="ga_app_court">157 Ga. App. 368</cite>, <cite class="app_court">277 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1981).

         Effect of dismissal on cross-appeal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Pursuant to subsection (e) of O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-48" target="_self">5-6-48</a></cite>, dismissal of the appeal does not affect the validity of a cross-appeal. It is only when the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction that a cross-appeal which does not have an independent ground for jurisdiction must also be dismissed. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Floyd, <cite class="ga_app_court">198 Ga. App. 99</cite>, <cite class="app_court">400 S.E.2d 393</cite> (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">198 Ga. App. 897</cite>, <cite class="app_court">400 S.E.2d 393</cite> (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When the main appeal was dismissed in the appeal's entirety and the defendant filed no application for interlocutory review of the denial of the motion to transfer venue, the court had no independent jurisdiction over the cross-appeal and dismissal is proper. Patel v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">234 Ga. App. 141</cite>, <cite class="app_court">505 S.E.2d 787</cite> (1998).

       - O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-41" target="_self">5-6-41</a></cite> does not, by the statute's terms, require the trial court to make a formal recitation of the conditions upon which the trial court grants or denies a motion to dismiss an appeal. When the challenged order complies with the requirements of
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-48" target="_self">5-6-48</a></cite>, the trial court is not required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in the court's order denying the motion to dismiss the appeal.

       - Georgia Department of Transportation's (DOT's) cross-appeal was dismissed with regard to a trial court's grant of an asphalt company's motions in limine and the denial of the DOT's partial motion for summary judgment since the asphalt company's direct appeal was dismissed for failure to file a brief and enumerations of error; therefore, the cross-appeal could not survive on the cross-appeal's own under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-48" target="_self">5-6-48</a></cite>. The DOT never applied for interlocutory review of the rulings of the trial court it was challenging, therefore, the appellate court had no independent basis for jurisdiction over the cross-appeal.

       - Section gives discretion to trial court to dismiss appeal if delay in transmitting record is both unreasonable and inexcusable. Corbin v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 33</cite>, <cite class="app_court">258 S.E.2d 697</cite> (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       When there has been unreasonable delay in filing of transcript and it is shown that the delay was inexcusable and was caused by the appellant, the trial court may order the appeal dismissed, and in such cases, it is error to dismiss the appeal based upon jurisdictional grounds and to fail to determine whether or not delay, if any, was "unreasonable" and "inexcusable." Green v. Weaver, <cite class="ga_app_court">161 Ga. App. 295</cite>, <cite class="app_court">291 S.E.2d 247</cite> (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Failure to apply for an extension of time within which to file the transcript does not automatically convert a subsequent delay into one which fits all of the conditions necessary to vest the trial court with the discretion to dismiss the appeal. The trial court has discretion to dismiss an appeal for failure to timely file a transcript only if: (1) the delay in filing was unreasonable; or (2) the failure to timely file was inexcusable in that it was caused by some act of the party responsible for filing the transcript. Baker v. Southern Ry., <cite class="ga_court">260 Ga. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">390 S.E.2d 576</cite> (1990); Burns v. Howard, <cite class="ga_app_court">239 Ga.

       Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in finding that the delay in timely filing a transcript was caused by plaintiffs and was inexcusable, given the plaintiffs undisputed failure to seek another extension of the deadline and the trial court's authorization to conclude that the plaintiffs had failed even to order the additional portions of the transcript until the deadline had passed.

       There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's dismissal of the notice of appeal from the directed verdict on a counterclaim, on the grounds that the three-month delay was inexcusable, unreasonable, and caused by the party's failure to pay the required deposit for preparation of the transcript.

       Trial court abused the court's discretion when the court dismissed the parents' notice of appeal because the undisputed evidence made clear that the delay in filing the transcript of the oral argument hearing was excusable and not caused by the parents as the parents timely paid the bill for the transcript, which had never been filed with the clerk of the trial court.

        While good faith is a factor
       
       in determining whether conduct is inexcusable or excusable, it is but one factor to be considered; existence of good faith does not automatically render an unreasonable delay excusable; whether conduct is incapable of being justified and thus inexcusable must be determined by examining the totality of the circumstances of a given appeal and, among the factors which should be considered is the existence of negligence on the part of the appealing party causing unreasonable delay, whether such delay reasonably should have been detected and timely corrected, and whether any such negligence was so severe as to prejudice the opposing party or to cause the appeal to become stale.

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-48" target="_self">5-6-48</a></cite> is that the filing of the notice of appeal does not divest the trial court of authority to consider dismissal of an appeal.

      Plaintiff's request for an extension on the basis of inability to pay costs, filed a month after receiving the bill, was untimely, and the plaintiff's belated payment of costs did not eliminate the court's authority to determine the reasonableness and excusability of the payment delay, in ruling on dismissal.

       - It is duty of appellate courts to inquire into the court's own jurisdiction and dismiss the appeal when an appealable judgment or order is not included in the notice of appeal. Interstate Fire Ins. Co. v. Chattam, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 436</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 618</cite>, answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">114 Ga.

       </p>

        <p>
       Notice of appeal must specify an appealable judgment from which the appeal is entered, absent which the appeal must be dismissed. Parish v. Georgia R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 540</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 750</cite> (1967).

         Notice of appeal from jury verdict neither constitutes substantial compliance nor is amendable.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - When notice of appeal states that it is an appeal from a jury verdict, this section does not authorize appellate courts to cause notice of appeal to be perfected by requiring appeal to be amended to show appeal from judgment or to treat appeal from verdict as a substantial compliance with the statute. Interstate Fire Ins. Co. v. Chattam, <cite class="ga_court">222 Ga. 436</cite>, <cite class="app_court">150 S.E.2d 618</cite>, answer conformed to, <cite class="ga_app_court">114 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Fact that notice of appeal is improperly styled
       
       is not ground for dismissal. Bagwell v. Henson, <cite class="ga_app_court">124 Ga. App. 92</cite>, <cite class="app_court">183 S.E.2d 485</cite> (1971).

        Incorrect designation of date of judgment

       <p>
        <p>
       - Deficiencies in the defendant's notice of appeal, which did not state the offense and punishment prescribed, did not justify dismissal of the appeal when the notice did provide the specific case number, style, court and date on which the final judgment appealed from was entered and information contained in the notice, considered in conjunction with even a cursory inspection of the record, would make clear the judgment appealed from, as well as the offense and punishment. Brumby v. State, <cite class="ga_court">264 Ga. 215</cite>, <cite class="app_court">443 S.E.2d 613</cite> (1994).

       <p>
        <p>
       - When trial court's ruling was made after a jury verdict for the appellant, the appellee is technically correct in denominating it as a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, rather than a directed verdict. Nevertheless, the appellant's misnomer did not require dismissal. Sanders v. Looney, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 379</cite>, <cite class="app_court">276 S.E.2d 569</cite> (1981).

        <p>
       - Since policy of law is in favor of deciding tax appeals on merits, even at expense of procedural technicalities, subsection (d) which allows amendments of notice of appeal from superior courts, also applies to notices of appeal to superior courts from administrative boards.

       - As it was clear that the appellant was appealing the entry of judgment in favor of the appellee, the notice of appeal was deemed filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment, despite the fact that the notice erroneously stated that it was from the prior directed verdict.

        <p>
       - Because it is clear from the enumerations of error that the plaintiffs sought to appeal from the trial court's dismissal of the city as a defendant, as well as the grant of summary judgment as to other defendants, the failure to include the dismissal of the city in the notice of appeal does not prevent the court's review of the matter.

Ct. App. R. 22(a), and the defendant also failed to clearly set out the defendant's enumerations of errors within the brief that the defendant filed, the court considered the merits of the defendant's appeal pursuant to O.C.G.A.

       - When the plaintiffs appealed from a grant of summary judgment, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the appeal which was granted and, between the filing of the defendants' motion and the trial court's action on the motion, the clerk mistakenly transmitted the record to the court of appeals on plaintiffs' instructions, the appeal was subject to dismissal because of the trial court's dismissal which was unappealed from; the plaintiffs' instructing the clerk to transmit the record when there was a pending motion filed by the defendants could not be permitted to deprive the trial court of jurisdiction.

       - Enumeration of error in a dispossessory case as to the trial court's failure to direct a verdict on the grounds of the lessor's failure to prove demand for possession cannot be construed to encompass, as error, the later refusal to grant judgment n.o.v. on the basis of the lessee's belatedly raised "complete defense" of payment of rent. The trial court's refusal to direct a verdict cannot be expanded to encompass other defects on appeal, because the specific grounds stated for the directed verdict must be the same ones asserted on appeal.

       - When neither the appellant nor the appellant's counsel (trial or appellate) files the transcript within 30 days of the filing of the notice of appeal (or, within 30 days of the entry of judgment), nor is any request made for an extension of time for filing, the appellate counsel's efforts being concentrated on attempting to obtain a release from trial counsel of the transcript, and there is no issue of substantive or technical ineffective assistance of counsel, the delay in filing the transcript is unreasonable and the unreasonable delay is inexcusable and is caused by appellant's conduct or appellant's conduct in concert with that of appellant's attorney.

       - Oligation of the appellant relates to the transcript, and the obligation for the preparation of the record rests with the clerk.

When the clerk fails to transmit the record, but there is no indication that this failure is occasioned by the failure of a party to pay costs, the trial court has no discretion to dismiss the appeal.

        <p>
       - Claim on appeal that the trial court erred by refusing to consider a request for a nonjury bench trial in a criminal matter was preserved for review despite the fact that the counsel did not state an exception or file an objection to the trial court's ruling, as the "bill of exceptions" requirement was abolished a long time ago pursuant to O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-49ol1a" target="_self">5-6-49(a)</a></cite>; the trial court did not err, as there was no requirement that a defendant be given a nonjury trial upon a request and nothing prevented the trial courts from ensuring that the defendants were given the defendants' constitutional jury trial right pursuant to Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI. Lindo v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">278 Ga. App. 228</cite>, <cite class="app_court">628 S.E.2d 665</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Given that once the trial court addressed the defendant's motion regarding sequestration of the lead investigating officer and the trial court issued a ruling, the defendant did not need to further object to the ruling in order to preserve the issue for appeal.

        1. Form
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>

       Section sets out forms for enumerations of error and makes them sufficient
      
      without reasons given. Dawson v. Garner, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 469</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E.2d 741</cite> (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Fact that notice of appeal is not in form suggested in section is immaterial
      
      for reason that section specifically provides that "any other form substantially complying therewith shall be sufficient." Chambliss v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 96</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E.2d 334</cite> (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       While enumerated errors are in proper form they may still be ruled insufficient
      
      or held not to be meritorious from record. MacDonald v. MacDonald, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 565</cite>, <cite class="app_court">275 S.E.2d 142</cite> (1980).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - This section, although allowing enumerations of error in highly abbreviated notice form, at very least requires that subject of objection be identified. DeKalb County v. Fulton Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga. App. 253</cite>, <cite class="app_court">274 S.E.2d 649</cite> (1980).
       </p>
       <p>

        Subject matter of objection need be indicated only in a general way.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Where it is apparent from the notice of appeal, the record, the enumerations of error, or any combination of the foregoing, what errors are sought to be asserted upon appeal, the appeal shall be considered notwithstanding that the enumerations of error fail to enumerate clearly the errors sought to be reviewed. Robinson v. State, <cite class="ga_app_court">210 Ga. App. 278</cite>, <cite class="app_court">435 S.E.2d 718</cite> (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>

        Where error enumerated is not intelligible in itself the brief must make it so,
       
       or court has nothing before it for decision. Pinyan v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">113 Ga. App. 130</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E.2d 452</cite> (1966); MacDonald v. MacDonald, <cite class="ga_app_court">156 Ga.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       Since subject matter need be indicated only in most general way, appellate court frequently cannot identify or pass upon contention which appellant seeks to urge as cause for reversal unless made intelligible in brief. Wall v. Rhodes, <cite class="ga_app_court">112 Ga. App. 572</cite>, <cite class="app_court">145 S.E.2d 756</cite> (1965).

         Language regarding whether or not transcript will be sent was ambiguous.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p>
       - Appellants used ambiguous language in the appellants' notice of appeal and did not include the statutory language suggested regarding whether or not a transcript was to be sent to the appellate court because, when the appellants filed the notice of appeal, there was a transcript of an earlier summary judgment hearing that was already on file, but the appellants had not filed a transcript of a second summary judgment hearing relevant to the appeal; and it was not clear from the appellants' notice of appeal whether the trial court clerk was to wait for the second transcript or send the record with only the transcript already on file. Webb's Erection, Inc. v. Colonial Pacific Leasing Corporation, <cite class="ga_app_court">345 Ga. App. 202</cite>, <cite class="app_court">812 S.E.2d 602</cite> (2018).

       <p>
        <p>
       - Although good practice would call for enumerating as error the inadequacy of jury's verdict for damages, question of inadequacy is sufficiently raised for consideration by court where overruling of general grounds of a motion for new trial is enumerated as error, and question of inadequacy of verdict is presented and argued in briefs. Kirkman v. Miller, <cite class="ga_app_court">116 Ga. App. 78</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E.2d 558</cite> (1967).

       Ga. L. 2006, p. 379,
   §
   1/HB 1059, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that:
   "The General Assembly finds and declares that recidivist sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Many sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and some sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The General Assembly finds that this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. The General Assembly further finds that the high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) Incarcerating sexual offenders and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) Requiring the registration of sexual offenders, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual offenders;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) Collecting data relative to sexual offenses and sexual offenders;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5) Requiring sexual predators who are released into the community to wear an electronic monitoring system for the rest of their natural life and to pay for such system; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6) Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The General Assembly further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual offenders and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual offenders to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual offenders. The General Assembly declares that in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual offenders be registered and that members of the community and the public be notified of a sexual offender's presence. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes. Likewise, the designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a regulatory mechanism and status resulting from findings by the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board and a court if requested by a sexual offender."

       After the defendant was found guilty of felony murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting death of the defendant's ex-spouse, the trial court properly exercised the court's discretion to grant the defendant a new trial on the general grounds because the court concluded that the jury's guilty verdicts were decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence and contrary to the principles of justice and equity; and the supreme court would not disturb the first grant of a new trial based on the general grounds unless the trial court abused the court's discretion in granting it and the law and the facts demanded the verdict rendered.

       State may appeal order dismissing indictment
      
      even if order is entered during trial. State v. Williams, <cite class="ga_court">246 Ga. 788</cite>, <cite class="app_court">272 S.E.2d 725</cite> (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      State was entitled to appeal directly from the sustaining of defendant's special demurrer, because the sustaining of a special demurrer, the result of which is either to strike from or add to the material allegations of an indictment, is equivalent to sustaining a general demurrer and quashing the indictment. State v. Mendoza, <cite class="ga_app_court">190 Ga. App. 831</cite>, <cite class="app_court">380 S.E.2d 357</cite> (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The state's appeal of an order directing a verdict of acquittal on charges against a defendant for family violence battery and cruelty to children was valid because the order was not based on the merits of the case but rather on the fact that the state could not prove any wrongdoing by the defendant on the date stated within the accusation; thus, the trial court's order was actually a dismissal of the accusation. State v. Swint, <cite class="ga_app_court">284 Ga. App. 343</cite>, <cite class="app_court">643 S.E.2d 840</cite> (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      The state was permitted to appeal a judgment of a trial court sustaining defendant's demurrer as, while the hearing transcript showed that the trial court considered granting defendant's motion for a directed verdict, the trial court's ultimate ruling was limited to sustaining the demurrer and, in effect, dismissing the accusation because of how the accusation was worded. When the ruling of the trial court is in substance a dismissal of the indictment, the state may appeal an order dismissing an indictment under O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c07s5-7-1ol1a1" target="_self">5-7-1(a)(1)</a></cite>. State v. Shabazz, <cite class="ga_app_court">291 Ga. App. 751</cite>, <cite class="app_court">662 S.E.2d 828</cite> (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
      In the state's appeal, it was held that a trial court abused the court's discretion by dismissing an indictment against the defendant charging the defendant with felony theft by taking because the fact that it could take years before the defendant would be able to appear in court due to the defendant's immigration status did not provide any legal basis for dismissing the indictment.

       State's direct appeal of a judgment granting the defendant's motion to suppress evidence that the victims identified the defendant from photographic lineups was authorized by O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c07s5-7-1ol1a4" target="_self">5-7-1(a)(4)</a></cite> because the state's direct appeal was from an order that: (1) was issued prior to the impaneling of a jury or the defendant being put in jeopardy; and (2) granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence that was allegedly obtained in an illegal manner, and which the trial court deemed to be "meritorious" even apart from the prosecutor's supposed dilatory conduct. During the final hearing on the defendant's motion, the trial court refused to allow the state to present evidence to contest the motion as a means of sanctioning the state for prosecutorial conduct that the trial court deemed to be dilatory in nature, and the fact that the trial court was the direct cause of the state's inability to meet the state's burden of showing that the identifications were lawfully obtained in no way divested the court of appeals of jurisdiction to hear its appeal pursuant to

       Final order of acquittal of all defendants was vacated because the state's pretrial notice of appeal of an evidentiary ruling was effective and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to try the defendants pending resolution of the appeal; because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to proceed with a trial of the defendants, such proceedings were without legal effect and the directed verdicts of acquittal were void.

       - Despite resultant justice and judicial economy, court will not allow criminal defendants to cross appeal suits brought before court by state pursuant to this section; O.C.G.A.
   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c06s5-6-38" target="_self">5-6-38</a></cite> limits that right to civil parties and the court will not encroach upon the legislature's prerogative by extending that right.

       - Where the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of the offenses of murder and hindering apprehension involving the same victim, and the trial court concluded as a matter of law that the verdicts were mutually exclusive and, therefore, vacated the felony-murder conviction and sentence, the court's order was, in effect, an order in arrest of judgment and the state was entitled to file a direct appeal.

        <p>
       - Although this section, enumerating those specific situations wherein the state may appeal, does not allow for appeal from an order denying the state's motion to amend sentence, void sentences are appealable by the state. State v. Shuman, <cite class="ga_app_court">161 Ga. App. 304</cite>, <cite class="app_court">287 S.E.2d 757</cite> (1982).

       Where the state contended that the trial court's action in probating defendant's sentence to confinement was void, the matter would be reviewed on the premise that void sentences are appealable by the state. State v. Johnson, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga. App. 236</cite>, <cite class="app_court">358 S.E.2d 840</cite>, cert. denied, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga.

        <p>
       - Since the trial court's ruling denying the state's objection to conducting defendant's criminal trial without a jury was not the type of ruling that the state was statutorily authorized to appeal, the state's appeal to the state supreme court regarding that denial and the denial of the state's petition for a writ of prohibition to compel a trial with a jury had to be dismissed.

       - While the state had a right to appeal from the trial court's act of granting defendant's motion to suppress, the trial court's ruling that defendant invoked defendant's right to remain silent was not clearly erroneous as the record showed that defendant shook defendant's head in the negative when the state police investigator asked the defendant, "You don't want to talk about it?" and, thus, the inculpatory statements defendant made in regard to the shooting of another person had to be suppressed. State v. Nash, <cite class="ga_court">279 Ga. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">619 S.E.2d 684</cite> (2005).

   §
  <cite class="ocga"><a href="#t05c07s5-7-2" target="_self">5-7-2</a></cite>, the state's attempted appeal was nugatory and did not activate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Georgia.
